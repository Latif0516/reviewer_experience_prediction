"lacks a little depth compared to its predecessor and the ai is beyond stupid in battle, but this game remains a fanstastic strategy title and a good introduction for newcomers to the series.",312.6
"civilization v is a fantastic turn-based strategy. ive personally have been a fan of the series for a long time and this is by far the best one. there is many different modes to play and multiple ways to win and no two games are ever alike. there is also a ton of mods for this game! so check out the workshop. you will easily lose hours to this game and i cant keep track of how many times i say just one more turn and never realize how late it is until after the fact. if you dont own this game already you are seriously missing out.",185.7

"civilization v is one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing. whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out. sure, i miss some of the deeper inter-civilization relations that the more defined religion and government setup brought in civilization iv, but thats nothing anyone new to the series will even think twice about. with all the tips, advisers and tools in place, this is the first civilization for pc that i feel is worth just about every persons time. go forth and create, subdue, and exploit. do as firaxis has done, and bring civilization to the masses.",125.1
"this is a pretty good game when you want to retell history so that the aztecs ed over the germans and then the united states joined forces with the russian queen. pretty good, i like hurting history books.",12.9
"civilization games keep getting better and better! civilization v is the latest, and arguably the greatest in the series. lots of leaders to pick from, and every expansion has added a lot of depth to the game. with several victory conditions and different civilizations with their own strengths and weaknesses to choose from, replayability is endless. playing with friends in a ffa against ais civs for hours at a time is also fun. highly recommended if youre a turn-based strategy fan.",363.9

"i got this game because my friend told me this was kind of similar to the sims 3 (i love this game :3). it is quite fun so far: my people are building houses, learning archery, and getting cute horses to visit their neighbours. however, my asian neighbour isnt really friendly; he always wants to fight with my people (i know hes asian, because he introduced himself, and he said he was mongolian, and i know it is in asia). come on, he is worse than a high school girl. >:c anyway! i gave him a bit of gold and then we stopped fighting and became best friends (forever i hope hihihi ^_^); i wish i could have made my soldier hug him, like in the sims 3, but i couldnt find this option. oh well. lots of adventures ahead of me: im so excited! =d",17.6

"wanted to wait a while before writing a review...so let me start out by saying i highly recommend you add this game to your library. this game does a great job of teaching you various ways of how to play the game. i wont spoil too much...but i will say keep an eye on your real world clock/time. you can lose 6 hours just casually playing this game...which i find a little troubling. if you are an adult with no children or house-mates...do remember to step away to eat and sleep. * do try and remember these words *",64.3

"fantastic turn-based rpg. this game gets a ton of flak from traditional civ fans, but the new interface creates a fresh new experience that you are just as likely to unwittingly spend hours playing. modding community is terrific, and adds hundreds if not thousands of hours to this already immense game. though i have 200+ hours logged, i have barely scratched the surface of content in this game.",224.9

"there are three dominant reasons why i recommend this game: 1. no micromanaging 50,000,000,000 things per turn later in the game, unlike other turn-based strategy games like rome: total war ii. a lot of game mechanics are autonomous, making smooth turn-by-turn play. 2. nicola tesla is a great engineer in this game. he has done some great stuff for humanity, if you arent aware. 3. there is a game of thrones mod for this game. there are freakin game of thrones factions and characters in it. that is amazing. if you dont think it is amazing, go make love to your sister/brother/father/mother/aunt/uncle/nephew/etc. and then try to tell me with a straight face that it is not amazing.",195.4

"i believe this game is great, but many would disagree... its the marmite of gaming... up there with the well known monopoly board game. its massively time consuming, your friends will get angry if you keep asking them to play and you have to be a die-hard fan of this form of game to bear with its tedious time consuming yet magnicificant piece of gaming masterpieces. but, it proves to me and many others as a shining beacon, of which pulls you away from the painful, dull and necessary work of life and into the gaping greatly lit tunnel of procrastination and determination. to those ready to civ... i salute you.",1012.0

"due to the fact i havent written any reviews for a long time, i feel it is about time i started again with this unanimously magnificent strategy title! what civilization v constitues is the climax of a renowned series. to begin with ..it looks stunning and its world shines with beautiful and well designed environments. futhermore when you start immersing yourself deeper inside its universe you will begin discovering more of its many virtues. not only has this game one of the most sophisticated in-game mechanisms i have ever seen in a strategy title but also it can maintain your interest for years. trying to offer a detailed insight into civ v could easily make me write pages over pages though i dont want to become tiresome. just keep in mind that this game needs patience in order to unfold all its features. on the whole i have no doubt that especially stategy friends are going to adore it!",70.8

"do you like stategy games? do you like board games? well then look no further, friend. welcome home. civilizations 5th iteration is a great entry in this franchise and is addictive as it is fun. prepare to loose many hours. some may tell you this one is a weaker game than 4 or not worth playing without all the dlc. i am not really in that group. i had a lot of fun with the vanilla game. the expansions add depth to mid and late game stages and provide more options for victory, along with new civilizations (each which has its own perks). if you have even a mild itch for strategy games then press buy. also note this game is very moddable - all supported by steam workshop. which couldnt be easier to use.",45.4
"firaxis games live and die by their expansions, amd civ v is no exception. the base game feels dumbed-down to appeal to a mass-market boardgaming crowd, and the gods and kings expansion adds tacked-on variety but still no depth - systems have no meaningful interaction with each other, and any one decision or strategy feels as good as another, without any lasting consequence. the brave new world dlc, on the other handm finally gives civ v the depth you expect from a civ game, with elegantly interacting system mechanics throughout and actions you take in the stone age still delivering payoffs thousands of years later. with brave new world, civ v turns from an unfocused and unengaging flop into a must-play strategy title.",79.7
"ill tell you what: dont buy it because it is too awesome to spend all your entire life playing it. the new bnw dlc add a lots of good content and made this civ5 not only a military-grind game but a more strategic game. you can play it for fun in the prince difficulty and you can challenge yourself in high level difficulties. and it did made me felt challenging, and i cant memorized how much summer class i absented because of it (hahahahaha in a word, this is a very good game. all you need to care is thinking about how to control yourself to stop playing this damn thing.",403.5
"awesome strategy game, one of the best ive played so far. first, when i entered the game, i was quite confused with bunch of options, but after a while, things had more sense. the game was made perfectly, with no errors at all, for both, singleplayer and multiplayer. battles, science, culture, wonders, religions, maps, characters, bonuses, expansions, all of them are harmonized magnificently. playing with friends is exciting, 6 hours marathon escalates quickly. at the end, just one more info, ive been playing civ5 for almost 7 months and even now, i feel no boredom while playing :) 10/10",160.1

"throughly enjoying this one - its not a total war game yet offers a new type of world domination approach. main objective is to either out science your enemies, defeat on the battlefield, annex or raise thier cities or go diplomatic and ghandi the crap out of everyone with world peace. building the effiel tower in hastings, england & having nuclear subs sink ye olde austrian pirate boats really will give you a feeling no other game can. likewise, building nukes and dropping them on your enemies from carriers in the ocean, then moving your workers in to scrub the fallout brings new joy to your fingertips. the game is workshop compatible, and the mod community is thriving with new ones to keep you buzzing and the game fresh. that said there is an unholy number of maps, factions, leaders and civilizations to build, destroy, conquer and make your .",18.7

"civ 5. where can i start? civ 5 is one of those games with everything. amazing graphics, in depth gameplay, astounding soundtrack, and a variety of different characters with personalities of their own. i would reccomend this to a friend, definitley. it is definitley worth the money. can not stop playing. literally. it is becoming a problem..",705.5
"being a strategy game, it is one of my all time favourite games of all time. after the hours i have played, i have become hooked, and cant stop playing. good things: the gameplay is fun, you have so many things you can go into, but being the obvious, science, and domination are the main two things to go fourth to. i like that if your computer can not handle the full graphics of the game, or you just want to have a faster, and better view so you can see the resources around you, you can always switch to the strategic view (pressing f10). bad things: it is very time consuming, yet addicting. the amount of time it takes to complete a full game, requires you to play with friends most of the time, and not random people, so you can always save and go back to it any time you want to.",574.8

"ill keep this short and sweet. i never played civ games for more than a few tries here and there over the years. i never played the original one mind you, but i played 2-4. i appreciate the genre, i grew up on board games like risk so this is nothing new to me. all that being said, i now love civ. it may have taken 5 games to get there, but i am hooked. i have spent many hours dominating the world, i will spend many more again. buy this, you wont regret it.",759.4
"this is definitley one of the best strategy games ive ever played. and the fact that its modable just makes it so much better. i might be new to civ but if you love strategy, get this game. its worth every cent. although if you want (cuz its pretty expensive with the expansion packs) then wait until there is a sale. then you can buy the gold edition. having an expansion pack adds so much to the gameplay. either wait or buy now, but once you do buy it, well, enjoy!",147.4
"civilization v is an immensely popular steam game, and rightly so. its just one more turn! brilliance is down to lots of brilliant options to customise your game and an abudance of great mods to add for further customization, no playthrough is ever the same. i would recommend this game to anyone interested in history, geography, or just strategy games in general; its realism is sufficient yet not so much as to be boring. first-rate game in my opinion. i would recommend that you buy the gold/complete edition if you are serious about playing the game. it gives you the nice dlcs that are really worth their money.",42.9

"it is a ridiculously brilliant game ive played around 120 hours and would not have traded that for time in any other game",372.5
"highly recommened especially if you have a friend to play it with.",237.8
"after a lot of patch and fixes, this game is finally incredible ! browse the workshop for useful and fun mods (such as doge as a nation) this game is as tasteful as fried potatoes with pop corn and bacon !",254.3

"i can get lost in this game! hold on...where im i? holy moly! where the hell am i?!",277.4
"one of my all time fav games, this requires you to have a stong economy while ballencing other aspects of your empire on multuple fronts. not only is this game diplomaticaly focoused it also has extreme focous for combat and war situations aswell. for example your units gain a bonous for attacking from a hill and can often not attack with indirect fire... if i had to make one complant i would say that some of the civs need a little re-ballancing other then that if you are a stratigist then you need to pick this game up 9.5/10",240.9

"hours of fun whether you love building or war mongering!",72.2
"this games is one of the most addicting games out there. youll keep telling yourself just one more turn then you look at the clock and a few hours have gone by. its a lot of fun. positives: -provides hours of gameplay -no two games are exactly the same -big diversity in playable civs and units -city states are a cool feature -many diverse maps negatives: -computer controlled civs can be extremely irritating -happiness feature can also be irritating overall great game. highly recommended. also highly recommend getting the expansion packs as they make the game significantly better.",459.9
"very fun game which will never get old with all community mods e.g world war ii",4.9
"this game is really fun to play by yourself but even more fun to play with others. even the short gamemodes are really long though so its almost impossible to sit down from start to finish of a game. when playing in multiplayer its a good idea to team up as the ais seem more agressive especially gandhi, dont trust him.",86.5
"this game is amazing. ive had it and played it for years, and it genuinely never gets old. it has an infinite amount of replayability, and no two games ever end the same way. id fully recommend getting the dlc as well as the standalone game, seeing as youll lust for more content after you play 100 hours or so, and the dlc civ has to offer is fantastic.",357.9
"im not even a fan of strategy games but dang this game is great",20.6
"i didnt trade horses with gandhi so he nuked me. it was fun.",138.9
"this game is just pure awesome! it allows you to run your own kingdom while either combating or being buddies with others. you must also develop technology and build a military and industry. the beginning game options are pretty nice too, the allow you to pick who you are, how long you want the game to play out, what era it starts in, the world layout, and many more things! its such a huge games that i could sit here for hours typing up everything! and the best part is... you can get more stufff with workshop!!! id say *10/10* for this game!",160.2
"if you are going to buy this game, you need the brave new world dlc. once you have that it will be great expirience. i recommend this game extensivly 9/10",636.2
"its a good game. why? -it takes away 3 gb free space from your hard drive -it makes you experience feelings youve never experienced before as you watch the city you spend 9 hours building gets destroyed by enemy forces -what, real life? is that a server? -you can get nuked by ghandi -you can nuke ghandi back so overall great game, should play it.",10.3

"i picked up this game 3 days ago, and have played 8 hours a day. the game starts off as a simple land grab and unit builder, but ends with 30-40 unit managment and high level diplomacy. plenty of customization features for the kind of match you want to play. there were a few graphical glitches at the start, but generally it was fine. 10/10 ghandi kicked my .",108.2

"this is my first civ game and let me just say that its made a great impression, me and my friend just havent stoped playing. dominating whole countries and having your whole empire crumble from one mistake. this game is a must have, the multiplayer is also a wonderful and fun time, just make sure you bring friends and a glass of water cause things can get stressful. 10/10",93.4

"to me? this game is fun. i can go for hours on end sometimes playin this game. not the best at it but there are so many options and goals. there are like 5 ways you can win for s sake. you can spread religion, gain culture science and a bunch of other . its ing awesome! especially with the workshop it has huuuuge potential. only beat 1 game in 20 hours but its definitly a great time consumer were u to play on your plane flight. i will never do online as that  would take days but still. good game if you like long matches with tons of options. probably the most changable game with workshop on steam!",82.5
"civilization v single-handedly drew me into the strategy game genre. the streamlined mechanics allows simplicity for a new player to pick up, but still retains depth for those looking to get more out of it. each playable civ is extraordinarily unique and the multiple paths towards victory increase replay value to a tremendous degree. this game is defintely worth purchasing, for history nerds like myself, strategy gamers, and just about anyone else (you cant go wrong with snagging this during the holiday sale). try it out!",143.1
"this is the greatest game ever. if you can develop a strategy to play, you will not stop playing. i play this and i cannot get bored. their is no o.p. things that can ruin the game, even unique abilities that are called o.p. have a small downside that if exploited is perfect. i cannot think of any gaem breaking mechanic that will destroy it any time to come. please buy this game, and maybe i may be competing against you to build an empire that will stand the test of time. another side not is that you will need to buy the expansions as they are worth it and are brilliant. i brought them then couldnt go back to playing without them.",238.2

"great game! had it for a very long time now but only just went back on it and it shows how much ive been missing out! it is highly addictive and extremely hard to turn off so i would definatley reccomend it especialy if your like me and love stratergy games",44.2
"definately worth the money when played with both the available addons.",357.2
"honestly id go for the complete edition for this game. you get way more stuff for $20.00 more, it sounds like 100 times more money but its a realy great deal.",285.8
"i have owned civ v now for almost two years, and it has always been nothing but awesome. even more awesome now with the brave new world dlc, and the addition of religion, spies, congress, tourism, trade routes, etc. this has made the game even more interesting. i lose track of hours on this, building my economy, while trying to build my army and not breaking the bank in the process, watching other civilizations machinations with my spies, and increasing border expansion to an all-time high without pissing off my neighbors. it is indeed very complex and i am always learning new tips and tricks. besides skyrim, this is most definitely my favorite game on steam. i give it 10/10 cupcakes.",141.9
"30 mins will turn into 30 hours with this time machine, i promise!",398.7

"9/10 - its okay i cant see myself playing this game for longer than 24 hours in one sitting",399.5
"firaxis took a lot of risks with this game, changing so much from civ 4. however pretty much all of them have payed off, and made the game much better for it. one great change is leaders speaking in their actual language making metting leaders more interesting. no stacking of military units is a massive plus, in civ 4 you were just smashing stack after stack into each other, it felt like there was no strategy. now it is much more interesting and feels like it takes skill. the only real thing i dont like about it is the announcer, he has a very boring voice. no where near as interesting as leonard nimroys.",93.1
"first off, i played civ4 before this and i really enjoyed it. now civ5 got more content, like nukes, changed some things around, like that only one military unit can stay on one tile and of course upgraded the graphics. but it is still sid meiers civilization, you start of with settlers and warriors and play from 4000 b.c. to the near future +2100. play with one or up to 11 other players on one map! but this time around, there are city states, you can either be allies with them and enjoy their benefits or fight them and annex their city. what i also liked is that you can find natural wonders, which when worked on by the city benefits you with faith. for new players, they put the effort in to make advisors, but as soon as you know the basics, they get really annoying. overall a great game, but you better of with the dlc. this game gets an g for good.

"another installation in the civ series, and a fantastic one at that. i just dont see how anybody could hate this game. its a polished version of the amazing civ iv. great job sid mier! i doubt you will see this review, but keep up the good work! 101st hour edit... i regret nothing",117.8

"the most elaborately exquisite game i have played such that the beginning of this recommendation used not one, but two condescending words",146.7
"well, the 251 hours played on this game most likely explain how much i like it however it can get a little boring if you only play on your own so sadly, if you have no friends, your screwed...",360.1
"ive never played any of the previous civ games and im a huge fan of catan (a board/online game it reminded me of) so this automatically won me over. civ 5 is more complex than catan in that it has more features to offer and its more organized, less random, and more relaxed whereas you can never predict what your opponents are gonna do in catan so it gets pretty intense. you play a historical leader (each civ comes with perks) and choose how you interact with other leaders and their civilizations. you can build whatever you want, from armies to cities, as the technology and resources become available to you throughout the centuries. its addicting and so much fun; i can only imagine the shenanigans and how awesome itd be to get a group of friends to play. plus im really diggin a lot of the references made with the achievement names. cant believe i didnt get into this sooner.",99.8
"imagine being locked in a room with big gaz g, and razza, while m.r. west films it all. this is the opposite of that situation.",243.6
"best entry in the series, which is saying a lot, because civ 2-4 were all also some of the best games ever. since the bnw and gnk expansions, the game has such incredible depth. you can play for 300+ hours and still get thrilled by beating the pants off the ai. you still look at your clock every half hour and keep extending your play deadline just a few turns longer, until its like 3am and you have to work in a few hours. oh and if you somehow get bored with the dozens of civs, scenarios, map and victory types, etc, you can go and mod the  out of it. 10/10",354.8
"started the cold war with me playing as the us and my friend playing as russia. the only difference was, russia didnt have nukes, and the us had no qualms about using theirs. 9/10 would nuke again.",37.8
"highly addicting, customizable, and recommended for both new and veteran strategy game players.",550.8
"this game is a true must-have for any pc gamer. i read an article, i believe on pc gamer, that said that this is one of three must-haves for any pc gamer, and i agree. the addictiviness of empire building in a stregy setting may not be readily apparent to the average gamer, and i must admit, i was skeptical the first time i heard of this game. but then i played it. and i fell in love. the depth of the simulation is offset by the simplicity of the interface of the game, and it can be as in-depth as you want it to be, allowing it to be a deep, hardcore government strategy game fore the more hardcore fans of the genre, or a simplistic delve into some fun empire building for the more casual. 0 outta 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",195.2

"amazingly good strategy game. if ure looking for great turn-based strategy game u dont have to search any longer! this is the masterpiece of strategy games, and with its 2 big dlcs its even better than just the base game. if i only had more time to play it ... it would be a great game if youre in prison, ud have a lot of time to improve your strategy. score 10/10!",4.8

"hands down the best game on steam ive ever played, i highly suggest this to anyone. i would suggest getting the full version; it may seem overpriced, but with what youre getting, it should be $40 more expensive. get this game!",322.5
"this game is by far my favorite. if you dont know already, its a 4x where you control one of historys civilizations from the stone age all the way up to the near future. the main changes from 4 to 5 is the change of square spaces to hexagonal spaces for movement. also, this interation removes the stacking and limits you to one military unit and one civilian unit per hex, so no more stacks of doom. i dislike how in the base game they left out a lot of the features from previous games (such as espionage and religion); however, they add those features back in on the expansions. all in all, the game is addictive and hard to resist the just one more turn syndrome. i would give this a 9/10 with exapansions and a 7/10 with just the base game",453.1

"this is an awesome strategy game. i havent played any earlier civ games so i cannot comment on how it compares, but it definitely ranks in my favourite strategy games.",39.7
"normally id start this review off by saying something like if youre into strategy games this is a must buy! but ironically i, myself, am not a big fan of strategy games, so i think it speaks volumes to the entertainment value of this game when i have logged over 600 hours into civ v yet dont identify myself as a lover of the turn based strategy genre. if you can grab this for a good price, its absolutely a must buy!",636.6

"ever wondered what the world would be like if the shoshone tribes had tanks and machine guns to battle some samurais? or if ghandi was held prisoner by genghis khan and after many centuries of captivity, india was saved by the irish? civ v is a very well furnished strategy game where the smallest quarell over some truffles can cause heinous wars. building, trading, invading/evading, civ v is all about those stuffs. some drawbacks though, it is a real time consummer. also, the game is less meaningfull (not complete) without gods & kings and a brave new world: two extensions that make this game a killer. so prepare your settlers and equip yourself with some fine diplomacy and strategy!

"an amazing game if you like strategy games. has plenty of gameplay, can keep you hooked for literally hundreds of hours. and since the strategy is turn based, you have no rush to play moves off quickly, like an rts. but still, wished it ran a bit faster and the loading time is a bit long, but otherwise a great game. 10/10 would bang.... i mean buy.",305.4
"amazing game, i was reluctant at first, saw it pop-up a bunch of times in reviews but i couldnt understand why people like it so much, from the screenshots it seemed like a simple tabletop game, boy was i wrong. this game will keep you playing and playing for hours, just one more turn, just one more turn. p.s. dont expect to finish a game in one go; games tend to last for days.",55.9
"with all the expansions, civ v is an extremely well executed strategic game true to its root. full of content and endlessly replayable with friends. had quite a few hiccups in multiplayer, but now they are largely fixed. steep price to get with all the dlc, but well worth it.",499.3
"in four words - best of a kind! totally recommend it!",409.9
"what makes this game is the expansions, they add lots of content and make the game more enjoyable. with this game you can play as caeser in 2024 sending a nuke to the warmongering ghandi. if you like historical accuracy/plausability you may be shocked by this, if you like absurdity and grandness but want a challenge youll like this. if your new to grand strategy game this is a good starter as the ui is laid out well and very easy to access. a good game can last for 12 hours from start to finish. i have to force myself not to click the one more turn button",426.1

"9/10 few minor bugs but with a great replay value, with sessions that can last for 6+ hours. decent variety in gameplay & gametypes, with alterable features such as core & dlc civilizations and artifical intelligence. great fun to play with friends, but lag can be present with high ai counts and world sizes.",146.3

"this game is just so fun and addictive, out of all the games i have, i like this one the most. this will be played even 10 years after its launch. if you like the age of empires series, then this is one you must get. but i do reccomend checking it out online first.",163.3
"by far my favorite strategy game. its an enhanced version of chess on an enriched field of play with the ability to create units on demand.",141.2

"civ5 is an epic and complex analytic game. whatsoever, i can recommend it to everybody who likes turn-based strategy and folks who like to use their brain. when youre playing call-of- and else, dont buy civ5, i really believe your neurological structure mass will be damaged when you try to find out how the game mechanics of this dainty videogame would work. hm, yes, im really certain you would die. exruciating and without blessedness and love. doesnt matter, the game is easier than civ iv and it has its own stupidity (click the right thing, next round, click the right thing, next round - oh a nuclear bomb! - click the right thing, next round) but its in principle good mastered so that it isnt in evidence. enjoy - or buy civ iv, both are good, the older is better but the recent is more modern.",34.2
"civ v is without a doubt one of the best games on steam. everyone i know who played this game enjoyed it thoroughly. the replay value is amazing! both expansions add some real new dimensions and do a great job to alter the game mechanics in a way that no other expansion has before. stop reading... you should be playing civ v",254.7
"truly a great game, i hope the dev team just irons out a couple more bugs in mp stability.",133.9
"i have been playing civilization since i received a copy of civilization ii as a child. what an enjoyable way to learn about history. if you bother to read the civilopedia, and do some cursory research on anything that strikes your interest after, the reward is great. not enough explosions and breasts in this one though. and where is my snoop dogg narration? i thought this was america.",112.3
"this is one of my favourite games to play. it will take away all your time and also your firstborn. but its worth it.",326.7
"a game so addictive it will eat your soul. the game feels extremely rewarding no matter which victory path you choose, be it diplomatic victory, space race, domination victory, or cultural victory. each game expansion dlc drastically changes the game, from the launch cinematics to core game mechanics, making the dlcs worth their value. from great wonders, great people, great works of art and literature, to social policies and idealogy, the game also incorporates historical places, people, and ideas into the game, making it even more attractive to our inner history-nerds.",109.1

"this game is awesome and very addicting. everytime i need to do something ill say to myself oh ill stop at 1 oclock and then 1 comes and goes and i keep on playing. only play this game when have lots of time to dedicate to it and do not have other important things to do. addtionally, the community for making mods for this game is great. there is wide variety of mods to use to spice up gameplay and to give you new game modes to play.",127.9
"as the first civilization game i play, i must say its amazing. at first i found the hud a bit hard to understand, but after learning the basics, ive got hooked! its just addictive, in a good way. i also have to mention the educational side of it because i actually learned a thing or two about history and geography.",33.8
"this game is a next-level strategy game. civ v is a masterpiece and now the standard for all strategy 4 ex games, and dont be suprised if you see more hex based games popping up. civ v isnt the great game it is without the expantions, unfortuantely, and you might think it wanting for more civs unless you get the expansions, which are huge by the way. civ v is another classic in the series, and it is an experience that you should want to be apart of unless you hate strategy games in general. this is one of the priemer games on pc, and is definately a must buy for any hard core gamer.",386.0
"extremely addicting. i find myself saying one more turn and before i know it ive played 50 more turns. its better when you have brave new world, gods and kings, and all the dlcs. if you see a sale, jump on it quick. paying full price is worth it, but not recommended. just....one.....more...turn.",49.4
"this game is awesome! i sat there for 6 hours and it felt like 15 minutes. also im friends with the one more turn logic so i keep saying ill play one more turn, but that turns into 30 or 40 or 178... must buy this!!!!",43.4

"this is a great game of stragety, and dominance. i ighly recomend it, if you are a strategy type of person",130.0
"i have spent over 400 hours playing this game and it just never gets old. it is especially engaging once you by gods & kings and brave new world dlcs, which add religion, ideology, and dozens of new leaders. this game is simply a must buy.",470.4
"a very addicting and absolutely fantastic game! if you can pick up both map packs with the game itself for a reduced price it is definitely worth getting.. the content and ai tweaks and changes make a big difference when playing. even though i have played (only) 103 hrs when writing this review, there are still many, many different civilisations i have yet to play. if you are new to civilisation games, there are many tutorials on steam to look through. the in-game tutorials are pretty decent as well.",237.0
"a really good game! the single player is very good and the multiplayer is even better. but its the dlc that really makes the game come alive. the mods dont always work.",116.4

"i bought this game without any idea of what to expect. took some time to understand, but now i think its a really great game! its different than other strategy games, but i think its nice not having to be quick, since i never been to good at that. i recommend it strongly, especially if you like strategy with more thinking time.",58.7

"veterans of the civilizations franchise may be immediately put off by the lack of features in this hexagonal iteration, but the expansions (gk+bnw) add a lot of content back and steam frequently has them for sale. to be honest the smaller scale of warfare due to 1-army-per-square and reduced warfare abilities in general as a result put me off at first. however, i really came to appreciate how much more significant country borders became as a result of this, making each expansion risky due to quick flanking maneuvers by the ai. i still think the ai for civ is still too predictable and even when set on random, a bit harsh depending on your difficulty level. still recommend the game for fans and newcomers, you will easily end up spending way more time than you thought carving your perfect civ.",132.1

"in my opinion this game has limited replayability and no challenge to it as i beat deity within a few hours. i certainly am not the kind of person to keep playing this for hours on end in order to shove a nuke right up gandhis  because he is a massive . overall 0/10 10/10 in reality. i live for this game.",450.8

"been playing civ since the first one in the dos days. genuinely thought this game was rubbish when i first started and preferred to play civ4. picked up both the expansions which changed my mind. g+k fixes the game and makes it playable and bnw is an improvement on that. so yeah, good game as long as you have at least g+k.",168.5
"i recently got this game, i was expecting myself to never get the hang of it but holy jesus! i really cant stop playing its impossible to stop, i got the hang of it perfectly in at least 4 hours which is very good to understand every little thing thats in the game. its the first time ive ever played the franchise and its good i popped in at this stage in the franchise. might i add... the best part of the game is going past 2013 :d 10/10",78.4

"this game is awesome and diverse. its very lengthy to complete a session.",270.2
"without any of the addon packages, civ v is still a decent game, but somewhat of a sidegrade from civ iv. add gods and kings and brave new world, however, and you have yourself a heck of a game thats very rich in content, very deep in gameplay, and very, very addictive. my complaints are few: namely, i wish the barbarian levels were adjustable (theyll wreck your civ in multiplayer) and i wish multiplayer were a bit less buggy. however, these are minor compared to all the amazing gameplay.",907.8

"as a big fan of the civ series, i like all the improvements civ v brings to the game. the expansions add some of the features from civ iv that i missed in the original release like religion and spying and i enjoy the rebalancing in brave new world. still, even the vanilla version is fun.",497.1
"this is honestly the best game ive ever played, whenever you play it you jsut want to play it all the way to the end, after playing the base game fro awhile i got bored and decided to pick up both dlcs and still trying out all of the civs. ive been hosting civ5 tourneys now. this game is like the console games for thsoe who play the aaa games. this is a must-buy.",315.2
"just...one...more...turn. i bought the game on a whim thinking i would only play for a few hours here and there. that night i spent almost 8 hours playing civ. although some hardcore fans argue that it does not hold up to civ iv, the addition of brave new world and gods and kings make it an amazing strategy game that can keep both hardcore and new players captivated.",34.1
"very enjoyable game, i havnted played to much but i for sure will be putting many more hours into this game",12.1
"civilization v is a very complex but easy to follow game with many different ways to play it; you can invite some friends or people you dont know to have a massive battle for victory with the unique methods of winning: culture, domination, time and science. you can load up some scenarios to play without having to start from scratch. or maybe the single player mode catches your eye by setting up your game just how you like it. never have i seen a game so fun and player friendly in a very long time. once you start playing, you cannot stop! let alone the easy-to-install 2 dlc packs. for 20 each, so worth every penny. if you enjoy a fantastic balance between strategy and action, buy this game right now. thanks for reading.",195.2

"awesome to play with few people, but only if you can afford to buy all expantions. if not then simply buy one of previous parts.",256.4
"one of my all time fav games, this requires you to have a stong economy while ballencing other aspects of your empire on multuple fronts. not only is this game diplomaticaly focoused it also has extreme focous for combat and war situations aswell. for example your units gain a bonous for attacking from a hill and can often not attack with indirect fire... if i had to make one complant i would say that some of the civs need a little re-ballancing other then that if you are a stratigist then you need to pick this game up 9.5/10",240.9

"civ 5 is definitely the best one to come out so far. the graphics and the gameplay are awesome! i have pretty much all the dlc and both expansion packs, which really add amazing depth to the game. i started with just the basic game at first though, and instantly i was hooked and have been ever since. i love this game! but dont listen to me, i am but a humble servant...",140.1

"i have a very soft spot for the civilization series. civilization iii, is, to my memory, the first game i ever played. i have since played 2, the snes version of the original, and this. like the rest of the series, its decently polished, easy to learn, has a lot of depth, and is periliously addictive. i didnt get into it as much as i did iii, but thats probably just nostalgic bias. if i had to complain, i would say that the diploacy is rather limited, and not being able to trade communications blows. thankfully, the rest of the game does it. also, i nuked beijing eleven times in a row, and it still stood, with two citzens who refused to die, district 13 style. 11/10.",35.5

"thanks to the streamlined experience and some simplification, civ v makes for the best multiplayer experience out of the series. unfortunately, for the same reason, civ iv is probably the better single player experience as there feels to be more depth and you have all the time in the world to finish your turn. vanilla can feel too restrictive and frustrating due to some of these changes, but brave new world brings around some exciting end game features meaning that runaway civs arent always guaranteed to win past t150 or so. if you got a group of like-minded friends who like strategy board games like risk or axis and allies, i cannot recommend this game enough.",165.4

"extremely addicting. i find myself saying one more turn and before i know it ive played 50 more turns. its better when you have brave new world, gods and kings, and all the dlcs. if you see a sale, jump on it quick. paying full price is worth it, but not recommended. just....one.....more...turn.",49.4

"this game is by far my favorite. if you dont know already, its a 4x where you control one of historys civilizations from the stone age all the way up to the near future. the main changes from 4 to 5 is the change of square spaces to hexagonal spaces for movement. also, this interation removes the stacking and limits you to one military unit and one civilian unit per hex, so no more stacks of doom. i dislike how in the base game they left out a lot of the features from previous games (such as espionage and religion); however, they add those features back in on the expansions. all in all, the game is addictive and hard to resist the just one more turn syndrome. i would give this a 9/10 with exapansions and a 7/10 with just the base game",453.1

"im going to try and keep this review short. so ill just start by saying, this game doesnt cease to amaze me. if your interested in buying it, i would highly recomend it. the only downside is multiplayer, which is often secluded from the vanilla version of the game, as out of the servers open for playing, most require mods. but overall, a very good game. it nevers stops being fun, and is brilliant for strategy lovers.",324.4
"after being gifted this particular game i was sceptical as to whether or not i would enjoy playing it, i do indeed enjoy strategy games but i also sometimes tire of them easily. i am also not one to read instructions, and for a complex game such as this i imagined it would hinder me at first if i didnt read about the mechanics. however, i decided to just dive in and see how well i could do to begin to understand how it functions, i havent played a lot of this game but i have played enough to understand how it works and how to role out different units. it is particularly fun and entertaining but borderline addictive - thus my recommendation is to buy this game unless you feel that you will fall into a time sink wherein the only light you will see is from the burning fire and destruction in the massacre of other civilizations you plunder and ruin in your wake.",84.5
"one of the better games that i have played. after you get started in a game, the just one more turn mentality is insanely addicting. i highly recomend this game even if you are new the turn based strategy genre.",290.2

"without expansions, i think that civ v is not that great of a game. with the addition of gods and kings and brave new world, civ v has turned into an excellent game. every victory condition is now fun to play, unlike before the expansions, particularly in the case of the cultural victory. the ai, while not perfect, has siginificantly improved from its base state. the addition of the world congress is awesome to say the least, and the religion mechanics are fun to mess around with. overall i would say that the game is to the point where it is at the very least on par with civ iv, and better in some aspects. remember, the complete edition is the only way to play this game, and is totally worth it. i even feel satisfied that i bought original goty edition the expansions individually years ago. its tons of fun. just watch out for ghandi. that dude loves nukes.",163.8

"a very complex game that has a slight curving point for noobs. though it takes a while to master it, it is still by all means my favorite game. the things i like about it: it has very fun scenarios such as the american civil war, scramble for africa, and the fall of rome to name a few. there are a lot of countries to choose and master. it takes true strategy you cant just build a city and say youll win (you probably wont with that overconfidence). a very good wide variety of maps too choose from. the multiplayer is amazing except for the fact that if you go to war with another human player you have to play in sequential order. the graphics are quite astonishing aswell. the things i dislike about it: there are no multiplayer scenarios. :( overall i give this game a 9.5/10 please leave any critizism in the comments. thanks! :d",426.6

"lots of fun. the single player is the best thing ever, even tough multiplayer is even better. you start slow but soon enough you create the greatest empire in the world. takes a long time to figure out how to play but this game is going to be played for a long time. you will see me play this a lot.",50.6

"a fun stratagy game that can take forever to complete. there are ways to play shorter games but i like striving for tanks and aircraft to stomp my enemies. cities are harder to defeat than any previous civ. takes a lot of artillery, soldiers and what ever else you can throw at them even when thier tech is low.",256.3

"very entertaining when played with friends, not less in singleplayer. developing strategical thinking and situational awareness , also providing countless hours of fun at once. its an unique feeling to lead your nation through centuries of always-different-worlds histories. though the base game is a little bit poor compared to the game with all dlcs.",461.5
"this game is such a great game. in fact, i hate almost every rts and this is the only one i actually like. its not the hardest to know what to do, but also requires skill. especially when playing on the harder difficulties. this game is more of a political game, being that you get to start up you civilization with one city and continue to grow it until its an entire country. most problems with the game are solved within the brave new world expansion. if you enjoy rtss or would like to conquer other countries with giant death robots then this is a game for you.",119.5

"a brilliant game. on the higher levels, it is challenging, yet just as addictive. multiplayer gameplay is amazing, especially with expansion packs enabled, however, make sure you (and your partner/s) have a stable internet connection, as the game may have a tendancy to drop mid-way through. there are many mods available for this game and i adivse you all to check them out. i am an avid fan of sid meier and cannot wat to see what they come out with next. definately recommended.",130.9
"with way more than 200 hours of gameplay (steam is always about 40% of what i actually played), this is my most played game in my library. this is not the greatest game of all time, but it is probably in my top three, with portal 2 as the greatest game of all time. while this game does take long, it is worth it and very consuming! i love this game and i would most definitely recommend it! i love this game!",231.5

"this game is fantastic! wether you are playing with or against friends or just playing by yourself, it makes you have a sense of accomplishment through completing the smallest of tasks. this game also does not have a campaign, wich reallly makes the player concintrate on having fun instead of beating the game. also when playing with friends, it does not create teams. you decide if you want to win the control of civilizations through war or diplomacy. the player decides who he wants to befriend or declare war with. i have a fealing that this will eventually ruin a few friendships.",58.0
"i really love playing this game of the amount of strategy involved. do build up your army or your towns? what do you research to put your civilization ahead of the others? do you march into war or be a diplomat? do you make allies or isolate yourself? whatever you choose will determine if you win or loose the game. if you dont have a lot of time i would suggest playing against bots as you can pause the game. multiplier games take a lot of time but are fun if you can afford the time. so go ahead and spend your money on this game!",21.4

"civivilization 5 continues to improve upon this amazing franchise in small and wonderful ways. the addition of the policy trees is one of my favorite because it allows more control over the way your empire grows and gives your civ more personality than it could have in previous games. diplomacy, combat and the tech trees have all seen improvements as well as a significant upgrade in graphics quality. the two large expansions for this game, gods & kings and brave new world also add a huge amounts of complexity and depth to the game that was lacking in the former titles.",397.7

"i love this game by far the best game you can get for wartime fun. the strategy that goes into building your empire up and making everyone happy and fat with food. after you build it up i normaly shot for a fight to death to see who wins and its epic the way you feel after beating the  out of your bff in multi player.",538.6
"95 out of 100 i definatly like the turn based play because it gives a refreshing change from the real time stratagy games i usually play. it can be a little repetetive playing against the computer though so try playing it with others for variety.",110.7
"this game is very entertaining, and i recomend it to anyone. i dont like turn based games, but this game is so well done and so entertaining that i never even notice that i have to wait for turns. the npcs move so fast, its almost like you never stop being in control. there are so many unique strategies to follow and the outcome of any two games are never alike. this is a spectacular game, and if i were you, i would seriously consider getting it.",19.2
"one of my favorite games ever. civ v features such great variety that you can play for 600 hours (like i have) and it still feels fresh. the game is well rounded and each of the victory options is obtainable in an enjoyable fashion. each civ for the most part feels different, and most are tailored to a specific victory type. the ai is strong and on higher difficulties very capable of beating you, however its through boosts not skill.",842.9

"i dont really like turn based games, but this game is differnent and i love the way there are progression trees for both policies and tech, thus maximizing possibilites for each player in the game. the multiple victory conditions are also good as they variate how people play the game so it is not repetitive and not everyone has the same goals. there are plenty of civilizations to choose from ranging from england to even civilizations like the zulu. unfortunatly i find multiplayer can be a bit poor because the games can last a long time and people like to quit, i find this makes it best to play with your friends as you can save game and continue with them later.",170.2

"the best strategy games/series... one of the best games. will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. puts the best of military strategy together with things like cultural and technological strategy and adds diplomacy (a little lacking but game play makes up for it) to create one of, if not the, best games i have ever played. the internal improvements, such as wonders and buildings, and choosing how to shape your civilization towards a certain victory condition even adds to the strategy. throw in the goty edition, along with g&k and bnw and you have a highly developed and emerged strategy game that will give you thousands of hours of entertainment. each civilization gives you a completely different experience and there are hundreds upon hundreds of combinations you can try. the dlc may get a little pricey, and the ai has some issues, but it is still, by far, one of my favorite games.",513.1

"i thought i would play for an hour, then got off 2 days later...worth it",89.0
"this game is the most stratigic game ever, i give it 10/10 the diplomacy, screens where you talk to other civilizations and you get to interact with theam is flawless and beautiful and dont get me started on the battles, the battles are a bit hard for starters you cant march to theam and win you need lots of troops to surround the city and shoot and bombard theam cause this game is like chess, almost you get to attack and move every 1 turn once u move all your armys, and farmers,. there are many factions to play but i recommen buying brave new world next after this for more factions where talking $60 dollors all togather. so i say if you love stratigic battles and bored games of non stop enjoyment then this game is 100% for you",67.9

"this is my favorite civilization yet. its beautiful, fluid, and still retains the just one more turn addictiveness the series is known for. the music is outstanding as well, with themes written for each country that shift and change as you progress through the game. the new tactical warfare really makes a difference too; gone are the stacks of doom from previous games. its a meat and potatoes tactical addition that really sets this iteration apart from previous games imo. its a must-own for fans of the series or turn-based strategy in general.",307.4
"this game ate up so much of my time its not even funny. if youre looking for a strategic game to play solo or with friends get this. the civilizations are great and the technology unlocks are just awesome. the biggest feature that brings me back to this game is the fact that each time you start a new civilization you know the gameplay and the way you complete the game is going to be very different to the last game you played. extremely recommended!",304.5

"this game started off great, and with the exapnsions and dlc it has only gotten better. it requires a good chunk of time to get the full experience, so if you plan on doing a playthrough in one sit down, expect o be up until the wee hours of the next morning. this games has taken everything about strategy games, thrown it together, and amplified it. i love the way the game is and i cant wait to see how it grows. if you like strategy or are interested in testing the waters of the stratedy genre, jump right into this game.",98.0

"from the beginning, there were several things missing to make civilization 4 the more superior game, with all of the added expansions and dlc, coming from someone who has wasted thousands of hours on the civilization series...i much prefer civilization 5 to the others now. this is the closest its going to get to managing an empire, forging a large group of people the way you want and almost everything about them. there is a large learning curve but i assure you, if you get past the initial bump you will amass countless and countless amount of hours as i have in to this beautiful game. i reccomend this to any one even remotely interested in strategy games, or games of the slower nature. i do not recomend this to anyone who is impatient by nature.",1065.3

"this game is so much fun but very addicting. people be like  i wanna play a first person shooter and glak people up, i dont want to read charts and graphs and . screw people who say that. this game is amazing. you will start and end up playing a 10 hr game which isnt bad considering an average game on fast mode is like 7hrs long. playing is so much fun and you will have a bunch of rememberable moments in every game. playing with friends or random people is fun and competitive. its basically a board game that is a perfect strategy game. buy it because it is a great game 10/10 easily. many hours will be put in and it is worth the pay.",79.2
"a game youll probably keep coming back to. replayability over years in my experience.",174.3
"civilization is a fantastic series, and v finally adds something the series always needed: hexes. with gods and kings it has included many refinements that makes this game the most challenging and difficult of the incarnations of this game. update: the brave new world incarnation changes faith and culture once more. cultural victories are still the most common kind in my games, since i tend to forgo warfare for technological advances. i miss the cultural conversion of enemy cities that was part of civ iv, but that was a conceit that does not generally fit reality.",263.9
"this is possibly the best strategy game ive ever played i recommend this game to any and all!",373.3

"i have played the civilization iv as well, and i got to say that this truly beats the iv. i will absolutely recommend this game!",93.0
"i love civ 5 but the only problem i have with it is not the game its the mods. they are all for civ 5 brave new world. i saw a cool mod that brought the lord of the rings to civ 5 but it was for brave new world! i recomend people who played other civ games but for those who like mods to spice their game up i do not recomend.",49.0
"very good. i think the decision to tone it down from iv was well-minded, but i think they over-simplified it. it felt kind of scummy to have to get gk and bnw to get features that would be a one stop shop in iv. graphics are good. i like the civilopedia and the historical accuracy. i reccomend getting bnw instead of gk, because bnw adds the equivalent of 2 expansion packs for the price of one. unless you really want the maya or the celts. still good game. like the scenarios and pitboss. dont think that games with expansion packs you dont have should be shown. it saves a lot of time. but if you like changing history and doing trolls to ai that dont know that youre trolling them, get this game.",260.0
"its like risk, only you can save and come back to with withouyr your cheating little brother moving all your crap around.",214.6
"look at my play time and you figure out wether i think this is a good game or not. you cant go wrong with it.",1021.8
"great stuff if you like spending a lot of time on turn based strategy. a lot of good things can be said about the game and im sure everyone said it already. as a bad thing ill say: if you like loading and saving a lot, you might get bored easily as loading screens take ages to go by.",395.9
"2 weeks playing one game (max civs, city states) and still not finished!",6.9

"i was deep in prayer when an angel entered my mind space. she was mixed-ethnicity and looked a little bit like a woman that worked at the local panda express (lol @ all of you who think that angels are white. god doesnt descriminate against any groups. read the bible.) you shall be the pillar of a new civilization., the angel said. then she told me her name was lucy. lucy furr. i didnt know what that meant at the time, but coincidentally, 6 years later, i see that this game is on sale for 75% off. so, i bought it. now im just waiting for a heavenly message to come through this blessed windows 8 :)",20.8
"this is an exceptionally great turn based strategy game. i havent played many other games like this but it has encouraged me to. i actually hadnt played the other 4 games in the civilization series and i found getting into the game a bit tricky but with the help of some mates and the wiki i managed to love the game. i ended up creating a relatively awesome empire only to be crushed by a backstabbing friend. so if youre wondering wether to buy this game or not i would recommend you do and buy the dlc brave new world, it adds so much and makes it so much better. buy it, get into the game and start up with your friends.",93.6

"i absolutely love this game. my favorite turn based strategy game hands down. will be amazing once the steam controller is released. i like the depth and customizability of this game, and the workshop support is a godsend. really fun game to play with friends, i cant imagine the online being that much fun, but lets be honest, people only ever play this with their friends. i love this game and i love how complex and strategic the battles are. the only tedius thing about the game is tending to all of your 150 units every single turn... aside from that, the game is practically flawless. i highly recommend this game! 10/10",90.9
"this game is both as good as balls and adictive as balls",104.6
"this game is amazing, theres many civilization to choose from and each have their own gameplay particularities. when you start a game, many strategies and win option are viable and you really feel like you decide what to do. at this point the game is well balanced and is a must play.",700.7
"great game, great to play with friends and the single player is fun aswell.",38.5
"hours and hours of fun. apply strategy and tactics, almost unlimited scenarios and re-playability. with the mod and mapping communites this just keeps getting better. worth every dime, and so are the expansions. well done game, solid running too, this is not a buggy attempt but a well thought out design by some very talented devs and a mastermind of the genre behind it, sid meier.",476.2
"this game is a must-buy for fans of the civilization franchise, and i highly recommend picking it up if you even think you might be interested in this kind of strategy game. ive only played the gold edition, which comes with the base game plus the gods + kings expansion. at the very least, i suggest getting this expansion; after playing this game with religion, i cant go back. i dont have the other expansion (brave new world), so i cant comment on it. vererans will know how the game works; you can choose how you want to play and how you want to win. the interface is very well laid out, the music is perfect, and the graphics look great. the opponent ai can sometimes be a little aggressive and will refuse to make trades that are clearly in their favor, but other than that the gameplay is fantastic. overall, i believe that civilization v is worth every cent of your purchase!",257.0

"if you like to spend hours playing as russia just to butt  america or any other equally annoying country get this game. you start out as 2 units some  settlers and some soldiers who are ing terrible. then you slowly build your way up to the point where you can nuke your enemies with little to no consquences. the a.i. will hate you but who gives a , not this guy. so after your done with you little nuclear holocaust, why not start another game. this time you can win a diplomatic victory which will never work out, or you could win as a cultural victory which is boring as , same as the time victory.",105.3
"i would recomend starting at warlord difficulty for new peoples",394.8
"play this if you can afford to become a neet. its a very fun game, but far too addicting to the point that your first gameplay will last you at least 10-15 hours. thats only the tutorial. i would give this a 10/10, but this game takes you far away from friends, family and loved ones to the point of no return. 8/10 - would play it never again (unless i suddenly had no one in the world)",62.1
"love the series! i am very happy with the linux port as well! a must have game.",58.7

"ive been playing civilization games for many years and still have the original boxes too! i was very skeptical about moving from civ vi to civ v given the bad reviews out there at the time of purchase. after 3/4 years and all the expansions, ive found it to be a great addition. the ai still needs improvements and the multiplayer is horrendous but the game itself is super. i highly recommend the game and if you were to play it with other humans, then id say choose friends and via lan!",430.8
"even if you dont have a life, civilization v will take it away from you. countless hours will be spent defending your empire, building it up, and dealing with the bi-polar leaders you are up against. ridiculously fun. buy it, but be warned: it will suck you in.",84.5
"great game, its worth your monies if your willing to sell your soul to the game for about 30+ hours strait for an amazing time :d",92.1
"this game is amazing! you may have seen sid meiers civization beyond earth. i still recommend this game rather than that because there as been more work on it than the new one. if you buy this game you will want to buy all of the exspansions for it. the exspansions exspand the game so much, the base game is not near as fun as all of the exspansions combined. i really would reccomend this game. i play with my uncle all of the time and we kill each otheror work together, and not even talking about all of the fun of smack talk! this game is amazing to play and even better playing with freinds and family. if you buy this game make sure to get someone you know to play with you. also make sure to practice so much that you crush whoever you play with in an istant, this game lets you achive complete and utter power. buy this game.",501.3

"this game is just awesome, addicting and adorable to watch. civilization is a turn-based strategy game where you can play as a world leader of nation or an empire. this game has 2 expansion packs who are worth its money. the soundtrack is just plainly beautiful to hear and it will never be annoying after hours. the character models look great and sometimes also intimidating. i havent played multiplayer yet but the singleplayer is how it should be. civilization 5 belongs to one of the best strategy games of all time. singleplayer rating : 10/10",105.1

"what can i say about the best turn based strategy series? multi-touch support rocks, hex tiles are great. its as great as previous versions, offering huge civiliopedia to teach you actual history, stealing your precious life with never ending one more turns. your average strategy game ends in 1 hour, while civilization might not end in months. not everyone can play this game, can you build an empire to stand the test of time?",266.7
"this is a really fun game, i have had no problems with it :)",16.5
"this is one of the best strategy games ive played. it is impressively immersive and quite addictive, so make sure you watch your clock and dont end up accidentaly playing it until 4:30 in the morning.",224.8
"civ 5 is one of those games that you can just never get away from.",75.7
"for a game that i would think was going to be sorta boring i was wrong. this game provides the fun that i enjoy greatly. i will also add when you start playing this game, youll lose track of time for real. although the game mechanics could get better because the same thing happens everytime where you research a thing and then build this and that but its enjoyable. for this game a 8 out of 10 is deserved. guess ill start rating games now that ive said that.",94.6
"there are two types of people in this world - those who dislike civ and those who buy the game and lose the next 16 hours of their life clicking on the next turn button. as a 4x game civ does it all: economics, diplomacy, strategy, empire macro-management, city micro-management, religious disputes, etc. and it does all of it in an immersive, attractive environment that progresses with the state of your civilization. the only real cons are that public multiplayer games take forever without a good method for pausing/saving/resuming but this can be remedied by joining a civ steam group or just playing with friends. at the very least, give the brave new world demo a try and find out how expendable your sleep is.",356.3
"civ 5 is a great game if you have tons of time to pour in or very little, one of the few games i love recomending.",270.6
"this is a great game you can spend hours playing either casually or competitively. this is the best turn based strategy game i have ever played and would recommend it to everyone even if the genre is not one you would normally play.",466.9
"if you are prone to addictions, do not buy this game. 10/10 would get addicted again.",18.2
"when i lost contact with my friends the ai in this game did suffice. overall a really fun game, can be a bit enraging if youre not prepared for a situation. 10/10",34.0
"this game has taken a lot of my time; probably not even close to as much as other people who play this. it is a very accessable game but also can be complexed. i recommend getting the expansions as the final expansion adds more importance to faith and culture. this game can be addictive though. i played 3 playthroughs; by the end of the 3rd night, i had 20+ hours into it.",44.8
"this game is fantastic...there is so much depth and content.",225.0

"for strategy games, this one takes the cake, and eats it too. the modding community is strong with this one, every game is different, no two are alike. multiplayer is nice, and with final update smooth, enjoyable experience all around. if youre into building up a civilization from the ground up over the course of 6500 years, making diplomatic decisions with other empires, whilst protecting yourself from barbarians and finding ancient ruins all in the process, this game is for ye.",97.3

"you spend 3 hours doing nothing but clicking next turn with the occasional ordering of a unit. for added fun after 3 hours you get nuked by ghandi. on multiplayer you and all your friends can hit next turn together for 3 hours before getting nuked by ghandi. 10/10",298.6

"user friendly for those who are fairly unfamiliar with the rts genre and gameplay. its addicting, enough to the point where id be up till 3am and not realize it; just blankly looking at my screen and yelling ing god damn alexander stop trying to start a war with me. it is amazingly fun and the games can go on for a very long time, i think my first game lasted about 9~10 hours. its an rts fans staple and for good reason.",19.3

"i mean, its civilization. if youve played one before, you know the general gist of things. i will say that i enjoy the move to hextiles over the squares previously seen, and i actually like some of the more controversial changes, such as not being able to stack an infinite number of units into a single tile. since i tend to play more for non-militaristic victories, the changes in civ v have, for the most part, not been things i have issues with. if youre into conquest as your main mode of play, maybe not for you. but if you mostly play a balanced game or go for a non-violent path, then i think youll enjoy the upgrade. make sure you pick it up with the two expansion packs, as it adds an enjoyable depth with trade, religion and culture without adding too much complexity.",124.3

"im pretty sure this is my most played game on steam, with, as of right now, roughly 177 hours or so of gametime. that tells you something right there, as thats a lot of time to put into playing a game. in truth, this is one of my favorite strategy games, and one i have played for years now, since i first bought it on my birthday a few years ago. the fun of building a civilization and dominating all of my opponents keeps me coming back again and again. with the addition of the steam workshop a while back, the game got even better, and now i only play with mods. 9/10",208.2
"its kinda like civilization revolutions for xbox 360 and ps3, only much better.",4.2
"just 1 more turn is what you will say after every turn of any game of civ v. this game is very fun for you turn based strategy fans.",421.9
"mechanicly solid - simplified/streamlined gameplay - one more turn every playthough is its own adventure - granted your willing to set your own goals. civ has always been about more than just a videogame recreation of history; its always left the player with a sense of achievement; more-so then just the players own, but rather, the grandeur of what our race has managed in such a short time. its the sense of optimism and hope that stems from those achievements that is so special and makes any version of civ worth at least a try.",411.3
"very solid experience for a wide audience! mold your own story, play your own way, and make your own rules. on top of the already solid vanilla experience, the steam workshop truly makes this game shine brighter than its predecessors. dont buy this if you have no time on your hands, because youll be itching to spend a whole weekend on it!",501.0

"amazing strategy game and even better for people who like to play with turns",305.8
"well to start, civ is an amazing game even if you dont have friends to play with! the ai isnt a pushover and can be quite challenging based on your difficulty level. but playing with friends is where all the fun is at! you can build up your own empires and then take down your own friends in so many different, and strategic ways! i should warn you, the game requires a lot of time, as each game runs for a few hours or more. also, it is very complicated at first so dont get overwhelmed! and finally, this is a very strategic game! it requires a lot of straetgies to take down opponents and win. but other than that, have fun!",110.7
"always addicting, i love how much more in depth this one is than revolution. definitely suggest buying it!",82.9
"if you come from previous civilization games you wont get dissapointed by civ5. it might not beat civ4, but it sure is a step beyond in the franchise worth playing and play one turn more. pd: dlcs are a scam, not because they dont add good content, but the price/content ratio is a joke.",310.4
"say youll play it for an hour 8 hours later well, i think thats enough for one night 10/10",46.0
"this has got to be one the most immersive games ive played. ive spent another 100+ hours outside of steam, playing civ 5, trying out a lot of civilisations and such, but i still come back for more. civ 5, like its predecessors (civs 1 through 4), is a turn-based strategy game where anything can happen. you can create and customise each and every town, from any of the available civilisations. with a variety of maps and playing fields, you will never have the same area twice, or the same set of enemies/allies/idiots you want to nuke, unless you set them of course. the 5 winning types bring a whole new look into how each civ has worked in the past, such as spain, with queen isabella, who is great with natural wonders, or japan, who likes to reck military with the religious view of bushido. then theres gandhi, nobody likes gandhi. seriously, get out of my games. 10/10 would bang again.",153.4

"i bever have prefered strategy games much but civ has drastically changed that. it gives the aspect of struggle and fun at the same time because there is so much interaction that can happen with other countries as well as there being replayability.",23.6
"i just cant get enough of this game. over the course of the game, you will find yourself expanding, plotting, warring, spying, reasearching, and backstabbing your nation to glory. civilization v is extremely addicting and it will leave you staring at your screen for hours while you try to convince yourself that youll only play for one more turn. seriously, get this game. p.s gandhi is warmongering, nuke-crazy, homicidal maniac. watch your back.",165.9
"if you like strategy or board games, i would highly recommend this to anyone.",146.9
"civ 5 is following the steady lineage of civ games. brave new world + gods&kings packs are quite worth it due to adding a ton of new capabilities. specialy in the brave new world the caravan tradings can make your day.",98.1

"as a huge fan of games like age of empires, i figured that civ v wouldnt be much different. i hadnt played any of the other civ games when i jumped into civ v, and boy did i love it. the game play is lots of fun and there is good level of strategy involved, though the difficulty is easy to control when starting the game. there are so many options and variety that its almost impossibly for me to get bored. most fun is the ability to play with friends. nothing says friendship like attacking with the full force of your military! :d",101.9

"peaceful ghandi of india. he declared global thermonuclear war on everyone. 10/10",236.5
"good game. you get the most fun while playing with at least 3 friends and play them of against each other with diplomacy and nukes :p",330.9
"10/10. this game is a wonderful way to make time go by. mod support only makes it better. cannot wait for beyong earth after playing this game for so long.",932.8
"probably my favorite game of all time and has great replayability. i love the strategy involed as well as the different ways you can win the game. i highly recommend.",370.2
"its hard to go wrong with civ, but now 2 expansions in, the game has really come into its own.",429.4
"the best time suck you can buy. many hours have vanished while playing this game.",314.6
"bought it on sale a few years back and wasnt able to play it due to poop computer. i have sense bought a new computer and i can say i will flunk out of my classes next semester because of this game!",27.8
"this is a real time strategy on such a scale i cant even beging to compliment it. the graphics are simply amazing, wonders are well detailed. the histoical information in the civilopedia is great for light reading, and the thought put into the units was wonderful. i mean, how many people knew about turtle ships and galeasses before playing this game. also the sense of reality in the diplomatic relationships between civs is relativly realistic. it is a challenging game, but not impossible. i like the five ways to achive victory as well. overall 10/10 stars and i cant wait to see how their latest game civiliation, beyond earth turns out!",411.7
"a great game, well worth its price. after over 420 hours the game continues to offer great experiences, both in single- and multiplayer. it truly is the best strategy game being offered today and well worth your money! ps: buy all of the expansions(g&k and bnw) for a better experience.",522.2
"i try making peace of india but he nuke me. why is india do this. i suppose to be peace. please fix but otherwise good gaming. india make me cry at night because many nukes into capital and make me die. one time i contimplating suicide because india nuke too much. and when i vote to be ally, they nuke me because i no make city of mine to them. very good game though 11/10 will get nuked by india again.",172.0
"dont play this late at night, or you will be up until 5 a.m. trust me.",48.1
"this game is my life for at least 10 hours at a time...",249.2
"the vanilla civ v is definitely still a great game, but really only shines with the big dlc (bnw and g&k). the dlcs give civ v the replay-ability you look for in a civ game. so, if you can snag the whole bundle in a steam sale theres probably one of the best purchaes on steam you could make.",476.2
"be prepared to ruin friendships with this game. it is very in depth and dynamic, and can really screw you over in the long run. 8/8 m8s.",32.5
"its a fun strategy game that is not only classic but worth the large time investment.",86.8
"if this game were a man i would go gay and have anal sex with it.",113.5
"you get to be ghandi with the great wall of china and angkor wat with enough troops to invade/ take over the world. realism at its finest 11/10",41.5
"really addictive game that will keep you up until the very early hours of the morning. at which point, you will promise yourself that this will be the last turn before bed, but you contiune until the sun pops up from over the horizon and there isnt any point in going to sleep anymore.",594.4
"i was weary of it in the beginning comming from the 3rd one (not counting the 4th) but thet definitelly delivered! the gameplay is spectacular! you just need to know you will sink a lot of hours in this - many many hours xd",162.5
"good game 10/10 can screw over friends by taking their workers.",128.6
"its wonderful if you want to sit down for a quick 10 hour match",48.3
"this game is amazing, buy it. its on sale right now just buy it now. p.s. get the compleete edition its way better",90.2
"dis gud game u cen pley hitler mod and choose juice as ur religionz. 11/10 would pley with pvpenguin again",28.7
"game is a lot of fun but the games take around 10+ hours to complete so only buy if your interested in putting that much time into a game.",218.7
"great for those who can stay focused for the long haul",281.7
"civilization v is one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing. whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast should play.",470.2
"very good game that i recomend for gamers it is a game about history",596.8
"fantastic fun, you could spend hours playing it. inituive gameplay and tutorials to help you get started. the addition of famouse historical leaders also enhance the fun. at the moment im trying to recreate the great british empire! i highly reccommend !",35.3
"pretty good game, and the dlcs are a must in my opinion. it got a little boring, but i kept getting back into it, lots of things to do, and different ways to play. especially fun with friends!",333.6
"a super intense enjoyable strategy game. dont even think for a second just buy this game immediatley!!!",136.3
"best game i ever played, i used most hours playing this than any other.",45.2
"this game should be rated 18+, it is way too addictive. 10/10",102.0
"civilizaion v is probably one of the best tbs game i ever played. the addition of gods and kings and brave new world makes the game better and adds many features. civilization v is a 10 out of 10.",571.7
"really nice game, could play for hours. graphics are nice, learn a bit of sketchy history while you play. has a multiplayer version which is great but after playing for a couple hours the games sometimes break and go out of sync and start crashing.",46.9
"yup, lost many hours with this game! will be losing many more, too.",207.5
"great game highly recomend it. be aware that you will be adicted",49.0
"for those who like strategy games. offers singleplayer and multiplayer. turn based but can be simultaneous actions for each turn. highly recommended.",630.9
"fantastic game and very addictive howerver, civilization v is too expensive on steam. bring down the price a bit. prices range from just 7.50 up to 15 on various other sites. (jungle).",104.7
"definitely not a game you should start up when you have something important scheduled. you know, like... sleeping or eating. the just one more turn syndrome will keep ordinary things like these well out of your mind. try the marathon mode if you dare... the multiplayer mode used to be bit wonky but it pretty stable after the last patches. definitely get both expansions for the best experience (the complete edition is usually up for 10 bucks during the steam sales).",683.1
"kind of slow to get into but once you start a game with a few friends, its very hard to get out of xd i highly recommend this game!",35.9
"my favourite game of this genre, i can play for hours on end and when im finished with one game i can jump straight into another without getting bored. the gameplay is amazing and your experience can differ every time based on the civilization you choose and the ending you try to achieve. civilization v - 8/10",94.0
"i have been a huge sid meiers fan ever since civ 2 and i love the civilization series, you can really get bored of ir and you can make your own nations and armies and attack others, control currency, build education, resources and much more. very well made game. the only thing that grinds my gears when it comes it sid meiers is that the dlc cost so much money. the gods and kings dlc is $29.99 which is the cost of the whole civilization v game itself.",10.3
"great game. it really does give you a good way to spend your time. easy to pick up and fun to master, civ v is the best civilization to date!",33.7
"civilization 5 or how i like to call it civ 5 is one of the best strategy games i have played like the total war franchise this was just amazing and addictive what more to say other then this game should be on your wishlist or shopping cart.",26.2
"hello i am a fan of games such as civ games and age of empires etc etc... and i can say for sure this is a good game. i have played it for about 100+ hours, not much for some people but for me it is. at first i experienced some problems with the multiplayer but i think they fixed the problems that could ruin the experience. buy the vanilla civ v and then buy the brave new world if u dont mind not getting some civilizations but if u have the money just buy the gold edition. well thats it, thats one of my first reviews, plz dont kill me. and sorry if i misspelled something, i am portuguese... thank you.",136.2
"great game, even for people who dont usually like strategy games (i was one of them). lots of hours of play, so be ready to sink in some serious time if you decide to get this.",34.6
"great game, best civ yet. but still not as good as alpha centauri",160.1
"its a very good game. time consumer yes. can take a whole weekend on a single game. not the best when playing only against ai opponents, religion is kind a dumb system if compared to civ iv, also why no technology trading? still i recommend this game.",199.2
"if the sqrt(-1) doesnt exist then this is my favorite game.",413.4
"easily one of the most accessable games i have played, a lot of fun and before you know it several hrs have passed before you even realize it.",8.8
"holy crap this is fun archers op 10/10 would nuke everyone again",48.7
"great game but you need lots of time and all the expansions. im a big fan of the civ series and have spent countless hours on the past games.",550.2
"i love it. i love it. i love it. thank you for making this game. 10/10 makes me wanna go out and command people to move a tile forward",106.9
"played for 8 hours aiming for a diplomatic victory only to have gandhi nuke my capital...12/10 would buy again",65.4
"great visuals and fun game. not as difficult to understand as predecessors but still lots of fun.",253.8
"fun in depth game. if you dont like turned based games then this isnt for you. the dlcs expand the game alot and add alot more to it. you will learn to hate the world congress if you do not own it. and no matter what you do on the higher dificulties like imortal and diety, you will struggle. but you will go out with a bang. or you play lower level and are equal to everyone. or basic and destroy everyone",236.2
"damn it rivalz civilization! when i snap you are going to be the first to go!",87.6
"a few significant strategical deficiencies exist in the base version of civ v. the game is genuinely unbalanced without both the brave new world and gods and kings expansion packs. if you can get the whole civ v package for a reasonable price, go for it, but i do not recommend purchasing the base game by itself.",358.3
"this is one of the best strategy war games i have ever played. love the brave new world dlc adds lots of needed features to the game. boudica ftw.",146.2
"this game is beyond amazing. im not really into strategy games myself, but this game changed that completely. i would totally recommend this to anyone, regardless of if theyre into strategy games.",80.3
"songhai and india cannot be trusted. you have been warned.",39.5
"such a great time waster, i can get sucked in for hours without even realizing it.",29.1
"easy to learn, but hard to master. this game is easily the best turn based strategy game to this day. with many steam sales putting civ on sale (due to it being slightly old), it makes it an even easier purchase. with capability with the workshop and plenty of dlcs, you cant really run out of things to do.",88.6
"god flippity hoo damn this game is a cracker jack of a blue horse god damn you shoud got get this hoo damn it is hoo boy oh boy never have i hoo boy",183.6
"civ 5 is truely a great game. with the way you must think of where to place cities and what to build as well as making sure other civs are not mad. must pick up and try!",48.0
"this game is ing fabulous. highly recommended. the gods & kings and brave new world expansion packs are a must have.",435.7

"seems legit. made me forget a few times that i had this thing called work in the morning...",34.2
"you cant go wrong with civ. cant wait for beyond earth to drop! hurry up sid!!!!",162.5
"this game is as addictive as chocolate to a fat kid. you can play for hours on end without knowing time has even passed. it just feels good when you can completely destroy another civ after a hundred turn war. it is a long game with massive replayability. i cant play this enough. <3",31.3
"this game is pretty good, ya know? ive played it quite a bit and i continue to have fun playing it. games. games. review.",98.6
"bismarck is worse than gandhi, dont trust him or he will redefine your friendship.",433.9
"it is good, but on mac it really needs mod support. aspyer, please put your act together, otherwise it is a great game",78.8
"what a game, hugely reccomended to people who are interested in historical games, for me its like the total war series but you can start from the beginning, and thats what i enjoy, manipulating technology! but warning gandhi.",321.4
"i may be slightly addicted. so much to do! love how in depth this game is. i am engrossed from the moment i load a game :)",36.2
"this game can either build friendships or tear them apart.",162.4
"i played this game for a little while and i loved it. there is a lot of strategic gameplay and several different ways to win and many foes to face on your adventures.",10.8
"do you want a really addictive turn based game? well buy this game and you play it... alot",183.4
"if you dont already have this game pick it up! g&k and bnw recommended.",139.0
"this is good, you should all buy it. be sure to get the expansions, they add quite a bit.",45.2
"great game. with the expansions there are many different civilizations to play as.",161.0
"one of the best single players games out there. once you get some friends to play with you it is 10 times better, but its still amazing either way.",374.2
"this game is so fun! i recommend all of the dlc. they completely change the game by adding a ton of new stuff that will make your experience even better. there are many civilizations to choose from and they all have their unique perks. you can spend hours on this game without realizing it. 10/10 would play forever and ever.",116.2
"after 2 expansions, and almost 100 hours of playtime, i can recommend civ v, but i also warn against it. not since the original civilization has a strategy game consumed me such as this. i fear later this year when beyond earth releases.",98.0
"good game with lots of dlc and content , very fun to play with friends.",203.2
"it will consume your life and you will be glad it did.",203.4
"civilization is the only game i have been able to pick up and play at random times and then continue to play for days.",258.0
"i am more of a multiplayer kinda guy, with that said i fould this game very entertaining and fun with freinds. there are a few bugs with the base game though. such as when you send a trade offer to another human player, they cam modify the trade in their favor.still very fun with trustworthy freinds ; )",64.5
"never trust gandhi, that  has nuked me way too many times.",31.4
"although sometimes it may be a bit slow at times, it is incredibly fun alone or with friends.",241.5
"a great game! dont listen to anybody else, it is a great game!!!!",331.3
"whatever you do, dont let ghandi get to the atomic age.",143.8
"this game is a version of monopoly, only instead of taking your friends money and watching the light drain from their eyes you are taking everything they have spent hours creating(probably by force) and laughing as they cry and break their computer.",159.9
"if you are new to civ like i was at first this game can seem a little overwhelming due to the vast amount of content offered. however after a few hours of gameplay you can expect to be navigating the overlays and maps like a pro. this game is non-stop fun and super addictive, i often find myself playing for hours and hours even after i say to myself that im going to play only one more turn and save. highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in turn based strategy games. game also has steam workshop which adds to replay value.",135.0
"i played over 200 hours of this game... i dont think theres something more relevant then this for a review!!!",247.6
"great strat game. not a lot differnet then civ 4, but still enough to warrent a buy.",347.9
"if you are into stragety games, this is the game for you really fun betraying your friends, and then crushing them >:)",96.6
"fantastic game, cloud storage is an awesome feature if you like me often re-format your computer forgetting that you have saved games :l by it and you wont regret it.",60.9
"must own! we all need to play together and run the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",407.4
"there is nothing as satisfying as that  all yall moment when every nation combined couldnt stop you if they tried, whether its through military might or about to launch into space or achieve cultural dominance, it really is a great feeling. nukes for everyone, its like im oprah.",146.7
"america destroyed denmark in thermonuclear warfare 10/10",174.4
"there are so many different ways you can play this game and do well. each separate civilization has a handful of different strategies that can get you the lead, and you can echoes to ignore them all and play with your own style entirely.",129.3
"i created masochism best game 2050 1.5/10 wood bang",32.8
"a great way to lose seven hours without realising it. if youre going to play this game, be prepared to lose track of time very easily.",201.5
"phenomenal, honestly. if youre a fan of 4x, poltics, management or strategy games this is truly a staple. customization, replayability and incredibly addicting gameplay keep people playing this for hundreds and thousands of hours. the game has one major flaw, and thats if you get the base game with no expansions, packs or dlc then it can feel empy, which is a flaw. though, at this point with all the bundle sales if you can get anything along with it it feels fleshed out and is probably one of the best games on the market for your money considering how many hours of gameplay it gives.",534.4
"i can spend years playing this game! fun solo player, and fun with friends :d a great way to destroy your friends egos!!!!!",118.5
"provides hours of entertainment. some games can last days, but its always fun playing as a civilization you like, versus those you dont. almost like making up your own history.",58.3
"this was the first civ ive ever play. it is a lot better than i thought it would be. i give it my stamp of approval.",163.5
"45 hours into this game and watched a 117 part playlist of it... this game is a must buy.",200.4
"this game isnt bad. it also isnt good. buy it if youve played the other civs and need a fix. if youre just getting into the franchise, wait for the next one.",81.9
"the best waste of time ever devised 10/10. probably one of the few must have games on steam it runs on practicaly any machine and has some of the most addictive stratagy that never gets old. even if you are not usualy a stratagy fan this game is for everyone becuase of its simple nature and easy to get to grips with systems. this game is best enjoyed with a low paced netflix series for maximum enjoyment and time wasting.",411.3
"a truly excellent turn-based strategy game. just be careful not to get sucked in- its addictive, and games tend to last several hours each.",58.9
"fun game to play alone or with friends. few improvements needed for the ai when playing against computers but still, i played many exciting hours. multiplayer is a bit tricky as one game can last many/many/many hours. all players have to be available at the same time. i recommand this game. you can start playing alone but then play with friends and your alliance will give the game a new dimension.",477.0
"great game, i have played over 110 hours and it never gets old!",209.3
"civilization v is like if risk and a tycoon had a baby. no i have no idea what im talking about. just play it",27.1
"what can i say about this game? if youve ever played previous iterations of this game (i started with civilization ii), then youre probably already addicted and own it. for newcomers, i think firaxis have done an amazing job simplifying the ui and providing useful prompts for new mechanics as they appear, so this is a great version to start with. even with the simplifications, all the depth youd expect from this game is still there and you can expose it easily (the city management screen for example). with the gods & kings and brave new world dlc, firaxis have made what i think is by far the most entertaining civilization yet! so, to summarise: buy this game if you have any love for strategy and a w streak. just be prepared to lose entire days to it.",496.8
"this is a game you can easily lose a day too. 4x games always look incredibly boring too watch but once you start playing one you just cant stop. gods and kings and brave new world are pretty much required too get as the base game was a little too basic. the five different victroy types make finding new strategys all the more fun.",194.8
"i whole heartedly love this game the first day i got it i spent the whole day with my friend playing it. stayed up till 6 a.m. this game is one of my top 10 its easy to pick up and play .the games are long but you can change settings to make it shorter this games makes me feel like the creator had the consumer in mind while creating this game 9/10",169.3
"i really enjoy the coop of this game. my brother and i play as often as we can.",262.8
"i dont understand how this game can be one of the most popular strategy games... its s-h-i-t... im not kidding, awful hexagone-style gameplay, didnt like it at all, but i have to admit that in the beginning when i first tried it out, i liked the diplomacy aspect of the game... the rest.. no so much",66.7
"11 hour game of domination to conquer the world, ended up losing a 1v1 against gandhi because he had an army of giant death robots. 11/10",148.8
"an improvement over previous civ games, and twice as addictive",29.9
"great turn based strategy. very addictive with a lot of depth. a lot of replay value.",53.4
"just one more turn you yell at 3 am after playing for 5 hours straight on the same game",52.2
"i think i may have just found a game to replace tf2...",21.8
"this game is the game that will make you late to work if you play it. right now im still getting used to it, will update review later, but right now, 100% worth getting it!",82.4
"i am reviewing this game. you should purchase this game should you possess the required funds.",248.5
"one of the biggest time sinks ive ever had the fortune/misfortune of meeting, sid meiers civilization v is a symphony of strategic awesome as you go up against some great names in history and establish your people. this game is great vanilla, but you enter a whole other level of awesome with the gods and kings and brave new world expansions. history buffs, strategy fans, and just gamers in general will treasure this game.",361.6
"this game destroyed many friendships of mine .... but exploding nukes are so pretty *_*",45.0
"an awesome game with loads of possibilities. it also works excellent on my mbp mid 2012.",142.2
"awesome game, very fun and in depth. also gives free trading cards. yay!",61.7
"recommend dont critisize until youve played it good overhead strategy game which involves planning and thinking ahead of the game. graphics are fairly good for a game of this genre. there are a few bugs (mainly on multiplayer) none too noticable.. i cant go in full depth personally since i dont have a great amount of hours playing. have fun.",35.4
"in the end, i got enough enjoyment out of this game to recommend it, though it still feels off and game-y - it really punishes you for doing things the wrong way, and i never really feel like i can attack anybody until civilizations have guns, when most of the appeal for me is playing as ancient empires like the romans. but anyway, its still worth playing.",38.3
"guys dont get this game is you have a life because this game will ruin it.",8.8
"great game but has a steep learning curve. dont turn on the tips; theyre the most annoying ing things ever.",99.9
"a great and addictive game! i bought this for 2 days and now i have 33 hrs played.",50.0

"this game ruined my life! its too addicting! 10/10 go buy it now so you can lose what little life you have!",948.1
"great game, i love it and intend to put many hours into it.",34.9
"civilization v might just be the most addictive videogame i have ever played. the allure of building a civilization from nothing to a global superpower is one that nobody can resist. the games political and militaristic intrigue is more absorbing than anything else youll find on steam, and for a game that doesnt even have a predetermined story that is saying a lot. its expansion packs are more than just glorified dlc; they actually add heaps of extra depth and possibilities to every session. this game will chow down on your free time like atilla chows down ancient era cities. civ v will ruin your life, but you will not give a single .",208.0
"this game stole what little i had left of my social life... you should play it...",180.1
"many of us have a country we admire, for me its russia, for my friend ransom (reisei) its japan. in civilization you play as the real world civ of your choice and see if you have what it takes to withstand the test of time. weather weather you seek to have the greatest scientist, the cultural diversity, the religouse influence, or the unstopable millitary... this is you legacy. i can play this game for hours on end against my friends and the ai. so if you ever wanted your own country, this game is perfect.",722.5
"i do highly recommend this game to anyone who likes stratergy based games, in past civ games they werent the best but this has topped it. and its also a good laugh to play with your friends with sneaky betrayal haha.",170.5
"like crack, but better. yesterday, i started playing a quick game agains five other civs. ten hours later, i won the cultural victory and i wiped out two nations off the face of the earth. basically, if you havent played this yet, you need to. but make sure youve pooped before playing.",13.1
"a pretty good strategy game with historically relevant civilations. only really lacking some versatility. 7/10",206.1
"such strategy much countries many faith such resources",69.5
"i love this game. if you have a life, you might want to discard it now",151.4
"highly addictive. the just one more turn and ill go to bed mentality has kept me up late to many times playing this game.",394.1
"after hundreds of hours of gameplay this is still my go-to game when im looking for something to do. cant recommend this game enough!",455.9
"the game where you; get the man into the space age: wage war, conduct diplomacy, discover new technologies, go head-to-head with some of historys greatest leaders and build the most powerful empire the world has ever known. great game:)",224.5
"civilization 5 is a fantastic turn-based strategy game that keeps you playing for hours. its addictive and a must have game.",24.3
"cant go through a whole game being friends with a single civilization",644.7
"great strategy game. in fact the best stragety game i have ever played, which says a lot. its not just strategy, either. its also fun to play online with your friends. but i suggest that you might want to learn the ropes before you face a deity-level cpu :) (btw, this is my second favorite video game of all time)",518.8
"best strategy game ive played. really fun with friends and still nice solo. any civilization? nukes? lets play some civ!",93.5
"such a fun game. brave new world and gods and kings definately made this game better than civ 4.",55.7

"i really like this game! civilization v is a very great game: tactics, politics, economy... you will spend a lots of hours of your life with it!",779.7
"this game is for those who like staretegy games but want to have some more time to think what to do.",138.9
"great game, but the games take ages so prepare for that.",122.6
"i never expected to be drawn to a civ game. they never really appealed to me before. however, this game remains my most played on steam and i constantly keep telling myself just one more turn! i recommend this to everyone!",35.8
"killed a hell of a lot of time, had a great few laughs. learned that ghandi is a prick. 10/10 would recommend",90.2
"for those who love strategy games this game is for you. i have played countless hours of this game. theres alot you can play around with. especially get the game with brave new world because it adds a lot more to the game.",360.3
"i love this game best civ game out there updates just keep getting better (somehow).",82.8
"excellent, addictive game...so many scenarios, and situations to build or conquer, may pull some all nighters for some games.. my only complaints are the multiplayer(its like running the game on the lowest settings) and sometimes the ai is just plain stupid. i highly reccomend this to anyone who likes strategy games!",478.3
"this game... just look at the hours i have put into it and i still havnt touched all the civilizations, playsyles, or even the map settings. single player, multiplayer, mods, dlc, this game does everything everyone says it does. one small flaw i will note is the ai is very hipocrytically unforgiving. attack a warmongering race and eliminate their capitol and it triggers a domino effect that gets the whole world declairing war on you. attacked a city state at the start of the game and conqured it, reached turn 300 still basically begging for forgivness from other civs. reguardless of that the game plays flawwlessly *for me* is absolutlely beautiful and will keep you comming back for years to come. even when you put it down, youll want to pick it up again in a month or two just to see what this scenerio would imply to the world another 50 hrs and 7 games later.",419.3
"great game. i have never played an rts before, but couldnt resist civ 5. there are so many countries, ways to win, etc. i enjoy the fact that i can play against 24 countries in a world sized maps. i can play the political game or i can become a warmonger and take the world by force. easy for people who have never played rts and yet still has enough content to please long time rtsers as well.",43.4
"great game, probably one of the most addicting and time-consuming in my library.",92.1
"a damn good board game as it is, civilization 5 was a best example of how to do it right, with of addons and add-ons, it became a overcomplicated turn-based strategy. for some its for best, for some - not so. and because u cant delete once bought content, game itself became something different then something what u loved so much once. so, buy urself a game and dont think of all other bulls**t like dlc, and ul get urself a best of civilization!",157.4
"an amazingly large game. thousands of hours of gameplay. the random stuff that can happen is just great, like starting in america as india and vise versa. a really great game that becomes more interesting the more people that play in a round.",325.5
"awesome turn-based strategy game that stays true to its predecessor while still making enough changes to stay fresh. the amount of map, time, and difficulty options amount to many possibilities and challenges.",94.4
"this one of the best strategy games i have ever played. dont let the fact its turn based keep you from buying it. its hella fun and my most played steam game at 60-something hours (something im slightly ashamed of lol). but seriously, pick this (and its expansion packs) up, you wont regret it!",87.4
"no gandhi stahp it! stop harassing me, gandhi! five star civ game. the expansions brought it up to and even beyond civ 4.",161.0
"buy it! it is the best strategi game ever made!!! - 10/10",734.4
"this is art. this is the better game i ever played. strategy,not violence. art,not trash.",73.9

"nothing to say about civ5 that hasnt been said. love this game.",262.4
"an awesome game. i dont recommend to the restless.",638.1
"i have been playing this series since civ 1 back in on my amiga 5oo days in the early 90s and if you are into world/civ building strategy titles in any way, shape or form, games just wont come better than this masterpiece, it is immensely fun, totally addictive and returns great value for your money. worth noting is that i have exclusively played vanilla (with the exceptance of purchased official dlc) single player vs ai for civ 5 (i.e. no mp at all) , but judging by previous experiences from earlier titles in the series, i dare guess that mp is even more fun and challenging. add to this the plethora of user created mods via steamworks and you have an almost endless source of digitalized entertainment!! :-) this comes highly recommended as a game with the almost perfect mix of theme, ambience, game mechanics and outright addictive fun.",182.3
"this game is completely addicting - i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys rts games of any kind. it just reels you in, keeps you going, and makes you not want to stop for anything!",961.2
"great for long term strategies, i never get tired of this game (escpecially with the workshop). the only problem is that its too addictive.",328.0
"it is like jesus made a casual strategy game and put it in a hex-grid",109.8
"1 word can describe this game, amazing, but that makes for a sucky review. this game is all about building a civilization, and trying to develop it to be better that the others in the game. you develop new technologies, fight wars among the other civs and city states, conquer land and found cities, spread religion (dlc required), and nukes. :uranium: there are some amazing mods out there for this game, just an amazing game overall,",374.2
"worth every penny. 10/10, one of the best games of all time. if you havent picked it up, do so now.",92.3
"awesome game. i cannot wait to see where this franchise is going to take us.",995.4
"10/10 would play until 6 in the morning everyday again",52.1
"the game is amazingly fun, and rather addicting. once i start a game, i find it hard to stop playing, always trying out different tactics to win. definitely a must have if you like strategy games!",50.9
"youll easily get a few dozen hours of playtime out of this, if you like strategy games. definitely recommend it.",71.4
"i believe with enough friends, an online match would be amazing",124.2
"such a good game omfg. if youre thinking about buying it, go for it. also, the brave new world and gold edition really make the game more enjoyable and content-full.",505.6
"who needs drugs when civ v will make you feel like an addict for alot cheaper",117.9
"really cool game, worth the money. get it if you like intense strategy.",45.6
"i love this game i just wish its gold edition came with all the dlcs",109.0
"wonderful game, fun by yourself or with a group of friends. however, i recommend turning on quick movement and quick combat (personal preference, if you play with these options off then the camera pans to a unit whenever theres some kind of combat, and it can get annoying :p). 10/10 , dlc is also worth it.",125.7
"free from gmg / golden joysticks, but this little gem has seen more playtime than anything else the last few weeks...",134.2
"cool game but enemy calculations take a little long thus it gets lenghy if u play with lot of ai ... the difficulty settings seem a bit easy",39.9
"online games get kicked and dont last but otherwise it is good game for sure!",82.7
"a very addicting strategy game. very fun in singleplayer as well as multiplayer. definitely a great game for anybody who has a bit of time on their hands. :)",119.7
"bought this through humble bundle and enjoyed it so much i added the extra ~5$ to get the full tier. this is my first experience with a civ game and i have passed on them before because i thought it was to complex. but starting from the lowest difficulty and work your way up seems to have worked this far. the only negative i can think about, except the ais evil trading, is that it magically turns one more turn to 3am in the morning.",34.7
"i beat ghandi in a nuclear war but lost to korea in science...fml 10/10",46.7
"as much replayability as tes skyrim (witout needing any mods) this game is seirously worth the money. the game is fun, and extremely coustimizable. only downside is that the dlc is expensive",186.1
"try not to consider realife logic, for example how would your jets be damaged while attacking stone age babarians other than that kiss good bye to your life",387.6
"opened game at 6 in the evening, looked at the clock when i finally took a break, 4 in the morning. 10/10 would lose social life again.",175.9
"this game is like drugs!! you just cant get enough!! o.o",170.7
"after installing this game, i lost roughly 40% of my waking hours to world domination for a good two weeks. totally didnt need that sleep garbage anyway.",94.7
"i like turn-based strategy games and this is probably one of the best games in that genre.",31.2
"amazing, if you love strategy games. its fun to play with friends, because singleplayer can get boring after a while.",212.7
"great for people who arent big in stratagy, not hard to learn and go crazy for power as you conqure the land and destroy all thats in your way. or just be cultral and win that way or even yet be into technology and be the first to the moon to win the game. the best thing is it takes time to beat it so you dont have to replay every hr it take hours just to beat the game half way. its great!!!!!",144.3
"totally not another ghandi nuked my  review. ...ghandi totally nuked my . (its ok, i brought him the freedom he wanted as ol georgie boy)",157.4
"go to market and buy this game!!! thats one of strategy games i like the most, you need to conquer rome in 100 moves can you do it? can your brain and eyes do that for you?! if yes go and buy this game, i rate 10/10",30.1
"completly worth buying mass multiplayer with good instructions and a interactive singleplayer i recomend considering a dlc or two",177.5
"what can you say about one of the best series of true strategy games. as with every version of civilization there are small changes which makes an old player a little annoyed. but once you get used to the changes and get into the enhancements you know why you purchase every one of sid meiers branded games since the first civ :) amazing game play, single player, multiplayer. many different variations never the same game twice, several difficult levels to challenge players of all skills levels. defnitely one for the more intellectual gamers out there.",433.6
"civ 5 is one of those games that people who like the idea of owning their own empire will enjoy. you can wage war with other nations and be happy with fruits of your conquests, even though many risks were taken. with dlc, you can watch as your religion spreads across the world. also, for diplomats, you can negotiate land, resources, and forge alliances. i would recommend this game for people who have a lot of patience and time on their hands, because this game is addicting as hell.",284.8
"first civilization game i have ever played. i regret purchasing it and wasting my time on it. my productivity has gone down and it takes many more turns in order for me to accomplish anything irl. 10/10",91.0
"this game is awesome. you can build your civilization from the ground up, going from flint axes, to chariot archers, all the way to nukes. but its not all fun-and-nukes. rival civilizations can attempt to steal your tech, declare war, or, even worse; build a city right there. im looking at you, austria!",294.5
"this game has destroyed my life. buy it and all the dlc. its freaking awesome.",182.0
"civilization v is a fantastic example of a turn-based strategy game, in this game you get to play as one of a large selection of civilizations and take them to greatness or death, they are in your command. this game has streamlined ui, great ai and amazing replayability. if you like turn-based strategy games or games that you run countries then buy this game!",92.5
"this game is amazing! its kind of like total rome and has a feel of settlers catan! such a fun game; everytime i play i always lose track of time hahaha!",8.5
"this game provide an excellent strategy platform which is both tense and relaxing due to its turn based mechanic.",249.6
"great strategy love it, i played civ 4 love the improvments!",32.5
"one of the essential tbs series. civ v is great sequel, although little simplified, but still got the just one more turn addiction. highly recommend the game.",55.9
"totally worth the price tag, one of the best strategy games ive played.",103.7
"when i was young i couldnt really get into turn based strategy because it felt like it took forever to do anything fun. as the civ series has progressed, theyve made it not only easier for newbies to get into, theyve also made the pacing very flexible, allowing you to play at whatever speed you prefer (still turn-based, of course). this game is a brilliant way to spend a few hours/days/weeks. be warned, when you start a game, you will experience the time travel effect!",491.7
"ill just play for an hour... look at the clock twelve hours have passed youve missed work and for the last thirty turns youve been telling yourself one more turn and then ill go to the bathroom.",170.6
"wow! what can i say about this game? first its so addictive you lose track of time, i would advise getting the dlc gods & kings and brave new world because this is what makes the game and it has great replay value. 9/10",98.6
"this game is great. this is for anyone looking for that good turn based stratagy game. i am a huge fan of the series, and the ai on this game are intelligent. they will attack if they see weakness, so you are constantly on your toes.",85.0
"the fluidity and addictive nature of this game really made me feel comfortable as a first time strategy game player. a must buy. unless you value your social life.",178.7
"one of the best turn based strategy games. (remember not only war strategy). fun to play, expecially with friends. but a word of warning. really heavy on the processor in the late game. atleast on mp hybrid mode. (my advice use standard turns in mp too). helps a bit... so if you like turn based strategy were you dont have to kill everybody play this. brave new world makes it lot better !",35.4
"this is simply a master piece, with unlimited replay value and outstanding complexity, this game could just be the end of all other games.",256.4
"i enjoy this game very much, sadly it makes the hours fly by without notice. multiple ways to win with diversification on the races. plenty to try with great replayability.",105.6
"an amazing game. the expansions make this game greater but the base game works just fine. when getting this game realise games take a long time to complete. overall great way to waste time, 10/10",29.6
"great game epic single player and great multiplayer suitible for all ages but may only be fun for 8+ you can play it over and over again and never get bored",167.8
"great strategy game if you like turn based games that allows you the choice between different victory types. more fun when played against human players as opposed to the ai in my opinion as the predictability is much lower but there are a large number of options and player mods to help change the game up if it starts to feel a bit stale. a really good pick up if you can catch it in a sale for around 5 - 10.",154.1
"amazing game. never ceases to show me new ways to play. just watch who you play with. if one of your friends seem like a power hungry, violent , dont play with them.",74.2
"this game is amazing. complex at first, the game has a good tutorial that explains the main concepts. the game has lots of layers and multiple ways to win, either through, science, culture, and diplomacy, or war and domination. this enables you to not always crush everyone, but to be diplomatic or be more cultural/scientific. your social policies can give you edges in certain areas of your civilization, and often one thing is connected to another. more science research means better army which leads to more diplomatic power and so on. only negatives are that sometimes the worker automation does not work and that one game can take days to finish. multiple characters and dlc enable endless replayability without the game becoming boring. overall, a great game.",125.1
"it is the beststrategy game there is in my opinion.",130.3
"its a fantastic game, only problem i see is with it not being multiplayer mod friendly.",400.6
"i cant rave about this game enough. at first i was playing civ v regular edition, but after buying gods and kings i realized how truly awesome this game is. definitely worth the money regardless of the price. 10/10",66.7
"civ 5 is the last in the series of the civ 5 games, a turn-based empire building game. a lot of fun as long as you have the patience and get the statisfation of building a nation and dominate the world. >:d",237.5
"this game is very addicting. i have played many times and i still feel that i have not done everything there is to do on this game. if you like to think and plan, this is the game for you.",154.5
"never thought any game could suck most of my life away more than tf2, boy was i wrong. 11/10 note: i recommend also getting gold and brave new world.",325.2
"a grand strategy for people who dont have time for real grand strategies.",146.8
"this game is the ultimate time vacuum. excelent for plane rides as you will either be disapointed that you have arrived at your destination before you could finish one game or be wipied off the map by the war monger that goes by the name as ghandi in this game. it is a wonderful game.",14.0
"the best strategy game of this gen (yes, better than starcraft ii), and its so insanely addicting games are literally played for hours on end. plus theres an attack on titan mod. nuff said.",59.0
"this really is an addicting strategy game, and one of the best ive ever played. it has an interesting gameplay system and a fun multiplayer section. while it may be an old game by now, it still has the useful replayable feature. pros: - addicting, and the urge to keep playing in order to win is always there. - different playstyles as different people, according to how you want to play. - mods section which allows you to customize your game using the steam workshop. cons: - ai which can be really irksome, especially in the multiplayer section. leave them for 5 minutes and all your moneys gone. - a tutorial system would be really handy, as for some new players it can be hard to get used to. overall i would give this game a 9/10, as while it can be fun to play, there are still some features that need some work.",215.5
"great addition to the civilization series, with all the dlc the game evolves and becomes an even more intriguing and challenging experience.",67.5
"this a highly fun and addicting game. it is a little different from civ 4 like getting rid of health of cities ( sadly ) and the stacks of units ( thankfully ). i also recommend getting the expansion packs as they add much more bulk to the game ( more diplomacy , international trade , religion , etc. ) 10/10",582.2
"this is a absoloutsly fantastic strategy game, the best of its kind. extremely, highly reccomended.",122.2
"a very casual turn-based strategy game. great game, do not hesitate just buy it!",83.4
"civ v is probably the best looking and most enjoyable game in the civilization series, plus major updates to gameplay every few months. very worth it, buy it!",156.3
"civilization 5 is a great entry in the series, and a good one for beginners to start with, since it has the design(-flaws) of civilization: revolution. not as good as civilization 3 or 4, but its prettier and works better online than both of them, so it gets the job done. the expansionpacks cure what the vanilla-version lacked, so make sure to get those right away, otherwise you wont enjoy the game, and even if you do, you miss out on a lot of content. tldr; the game is bland if played vanilla, with expansion + dlc the game is great.",310.5
"just dont think about it, it is a steam must have!!!!",38.2
"great game would recommend. i have yet to try the expansions though.",95.1
"a bit doubtful as to whether i would like this game before i first played it, and in the first two days after buying it i played about 19 hours of it. this is a fantastic game.",454.4
"this is a really good game if you enjoy being tactical with things, its really nice for planning out strategies or just ing around making war with everyone, i really do recommend it, its awesome",35.4
"umm okay this was a pretty fun game but there was no sid meier civilization included in the game and it has yet to be patched in so either change the title and quit misleading your customers or i will write about this in my blog. youve been warned. 10/1000 a+",158.3
"hours and hours of slaughtering any empire that dared to denounce you during your early stages, and eventually conquering the entire world is probably the most fun ive had with a game that involves slaughtering entire countries.",112.5
"i... cant... stop... pleae help me. just one more turn.",457.9
"i highly recommend this game if you really like to kill time, literally. just so you know, this is a real time strategy, similar with age of empires, but this one is in turn-based system which i think have made this game much interesting to play. and the ai is hard enough to beat if you didnt set up your strategy well. the best thing that makes this game one of my favorites is civilization v is not all about war, war and war. you can try nuke, nuke and nuke for fun. (note: this is a game which could kill your real life.)",64.3
"love the game a little bit hard to get use to but its bottyful",127.3
"this game is insanely awesome. sid meiers is an inspiration to the gaming world. i have never said anything bad about his work and i never will!",793.3
"the game does have its ups and downs, like how the ai cheats and somehow gets way ahead really early on, but in general the game is a great game.",37.1
"if you hate seeing the outside of your room and want ghandi to ing kill your  with nukes and tanks this is the game for you",184.6
"i love this game so much that i want to have sex with it!!!",58.9
"dont even play this game. it is way too addictive. you will never sleep.",266.0
"durr, dis geme gud, u can rekt someune, u can take dem teritori, u can blew dem ap, u can be king, hurr hurr",25.9
"cililization v is one of the most addictive games of all time. take the throne of 1 of many nations and build your empire. will you be a ruler who leads his/her people in peace or rule with an iron fist, crushing all those who would stand against you? the choice is yours. be careful however, as other nations may not like the way you rise on the world stage.",1089.2
"play it all the time, great game for people looking for a strategy turn based game. i strongly recommend it to people looking for a game that you can just start and play over a few days. great re-play value and overall, i feel it was a great purchase.",336.5
"just give up on trying to go outside because this is the end....",48.7
"one more turn, just one more turn... 6 hours later and ive got an hour till i have to go to work. time enough for one more turn...",29.3
"this is definitely one of the greatest games ive ever played. i wouldnt reccomend getting the vanilla version though. with gnk expansion its very good but really starts to shine when you add brave new world. watch out though its really addicting and a single game can take up to like 10h but if you can spare this game some time you definitely wont be dissapointed.",99.9
"love the game!!!!! it never really gets boring because you can switch civis every game. i like how the ais are really smart. you do not have to buy the dlc for it to be fun.",363.5
"awesome, just one more turn + the expansions are very good and make the game even more exciting!",135.4
"this game is epic ! sad that brave new world and gods and kings is so expensive !",55.7
"the ultimate strategy game. the good: lots of strategic choices, stunning graphics, culturally very rich. the bad: too long games.",388.6
"very fun game where you can command one of many civilizations from around time. go to war with montezuma as george washington with genghis khan at your side, or generate tourism for your civ. fly into space, or be elected world leader. infinite replay value. the expansion packs and civilization dlcs (korea, polynesia, babylon, denmark) add a lot to the game, and made my playthroughs a lot more fun. brave new world, the second expansion, really fleshed out cultural victories. mods add a lot of content to the game, including maps, civilizations, and scenarios. anyways, this is a great game, and i personally cannot wait for civilization: beyond earth next fall. 9.5/10",62.9
"god has given us the glory of bretrayal and nuclear war with gandhi, thus i give the title of funniest/ funnest game to civ 5, but realy its an amazing game and worth the money.",306.2
"there is many things wrong with the world. its your job to fix it. get this game",65.4
"this is a game you may not play too often, but when you start a game, be prepared for the next 5-50 hours to be solely focussed on wiping gandi off the face of the planet with nuclear weaponary. your visions of being a peaceful civilisation are shattered by your own self greed for world domination, your small tribe of simple warriors have evolved into super death machines that march from london to tokyo (perhaps because japan settled too close to you and the city is only 2 turns walk away). destroy, conquer and rebuild! *ahem* a few downsides to this game is that you may never return to an old campign, each session generally feels like its time to begin anew. also, no one watching over your shoulder will understand how fun/addictive this game is, you just need to play it to understand.",143.9
"it is very fun game to play. and on higher difficulties a challenge to win the game.",211.2
"its a great strategy game where you start off as a civilization of your choice and you battle for victory against many other civilizations. the game has different modes and scenarios so no match is the exact same.",82.5
"the only game where i can shoot down jets with arrows and destroy tanks with spears. 10/10",127.0
"me like yes good 4 stars out of 2 thumbs thanks obama",54.2
"a great game for anyone that wants to burn a few hours. its a game of wits and brute strength, forging allies and waging war all to gain a foothold over your rivals. many or few, every game is different with a huge selection of map types and playable factions. i have played multiple runs of this game and still it is my favorite civ from sid so far. im sure ill have many more hours in this game as the acheivment list is 200+. multiplayer has a little to be desired as the matching can sometime take awhile and games tend to get overpowered one way or another rather early on. finding solid players that can last a match is uncommon. with all being said the game is definetly playing.",379.3
"i have played civilization since the original version and love it to this day. this version has some drastic changes that are unique in the series but is still very much civilization. highly recommended.",876.6
"for those who knows how to think! not best in series but almost incredible with new dlc.",152.9
"an awesome strategic game with an endless number of things to do on it. yes, i said endless. it has nearly 300 achievements.",63.5
"nice addictable game, just sit back and play how you like it.",248.8
"i dont have enough hours i this game. its amazingly talented, unlike my skills in it",17.5
"this game is a wonderful addition to the civilization frenchise. it has everything you would need. owning the brave new world dlc also makes the game play a lot more fun and better. the controls and the gameflow are rather simple and intuitive; i even got by 7 year old brother to play with me and he could play it. great game.",107.8
"this fifth installment really brings my previous civ gaming experiences to the next level. :) as a history and a book lover, civilization 5 brings me to the days of old when nations are still small, wars are constant, where seeds technological development are still being planted and watered for growth, wonders are being constructed, etc. this game gives users the best perspective of seeing how the nations of the world evolve and continues to evolve until now. nice gameplay, superb detail and graphics, plus the accuracy of ai leader personalities (based on history) really gives you that great feeling leading your chosen civilization to glory. the different systems in the game, the religion and espionage (in gods and kings) adds depth to gameplay. it gives the player multiple ways to achieve victory for a civ. i just love this game so much.",527.8
"awesome game, lots of fun with friends. be prepared to lose all track of time. just one more turn turns into hours...lol",318.8
"outstanding game, i recommend it to everyone who is looking for a fun turn-based strategy game.",95.9

"great game. however, dont play without a clock because you will lose track of time.",93.4
"this game!!!!! im not usually the type to enjoy a game like this, im more into arma and the such, but picking this up in the sale was a genious idea! everything looks so crisp and clean, a little hard to get used to at first, but thanks to the tutorial after a game or two youll pick up everything you need to know. this game is made even better if you have friends to play it with too as thanks to the steam cloud saving you can load up your saved game with your friend anytime, and stop playing whenever you like.",56.1
"this game is pure crack. there is nothing more addictive than this game. i want to gift this game only to my worst enemies and all the evil mad humans out there. get somebody in touch with kim jong-un, set him up a steam-account and get him this game: it kills lifetime without being able to be productive in any form(except playing this game). the world will be a better and peacefull place if we can get those kind of people playing civ v!",82.5

"this is one of my favorite games of all time, if your looking for a game with great gameplay, awsome multiplayer, and hours upon hours of fun... buy this game!",66.1
"this game is a turn based strategy title based on actual history. it makes learning history fun as you take control of countries as far back as the ancient era and rule them in your own way.",41.2
"its a really cool game if you like strategy games. this is a really fun strategy game, that has action but also takes a ton of thought. one downside is it takes probably 12 hours minimum for each game.",52.6
"ive had the base game a long while now. and the expansions just make it better. this game will never grow old for me",494.4
"one of the best stategy games ive played some things could be better for exaple the soundtrack or diplomatcy but all in all good game",373.5

"i liked this game great city management. i liked the hitorical accuracy of the special units great people and leaders.",123.1
"is a fun game if you want to spend a long time to play. if you enjoy management and strategy you will enjoy yourself. there are very little amount of bugs and glitches but the game can run slow if you have a poor coomputer. overall i would give this a 8.5 out of 10.",197.3

"all time favorite game, ive palyed for hundreds of hours always on huge and have yet to finish a game, but its about as perfect as a game has ever been to me. if you like strategy with actual diplomacy and trade, this game with all of its expansions accomplishes it.",425.1
"i like this game alot. i really feel in control of my civilization as i play. i can craft my people into anything. i feel like i make alot of ememies as i play with my friends.",118.3
"a really craking game that doesnt stop entertaining. truly remarkable.",266.8
"not as good as civ iv. but civ iv is one of the worlds best tactic games and not many games are better than it. civilization v is something new and special. there are new buildings, soldiers and diplomatic possibilities. when youve played it for some hours you know how it works and you can use the many different tools to become the biggest civilization ever.",65.8
"civ v is a good game if your into strategy and all that",263.8
"its good, but this game will just eat up all of your time.",68.9
"combat is better than iv but everything else is a little less fun. from what i understand bnw really makes this the game it is supposed to be. it is still a great game though.",670.3
"how many hours have i lost? what year is it? why is my underwear solid? these are all questions i ask myself when i finish playing a game of civ 5 and all of it is worth the pain of 100 asleep buttocks. seriously though this game is great and worth every penny you could pick up and through at it.",60.1
"ive logged almost 500 hours in this game. best civ so far.",611.6
"im not a huge strategy player, but this one hooked me. i cannot reccommend this game if you plan on doing anything with your life other than playing it. the hours vanish when you start it up.",108.9
"basicly its like paper please, but its not 10/10 paper please is good game",98.3

"bestest game ever. get ready to lose all sense of reality and gain lots of awesomeness and fun when you press play now. :) oh, and be weary of that gandhi chap...",953.5
"i highly recommend this game. the graphics are awesome and the gameplay is so open that you can run any civ how you want (although some strategies are more effective than others with certain factions). the game allows for so much variation between individual games and you will never play the same match twice because of random starting points and different civs that you face.",88.8
"seriously fun to play with a bunch of friends but beware... the games last forever. forever!",91.4
"fantastic game, gave me a very bad case of one-more-turn-itis.",741.5
"literally the best gaming experience for those with any appreciation for history. this game gives you the ability to rewrite the history of a new world, possesing an industrious nation state/classical empire of your choice. you have the ability to persue a victory in cultural supremacy, scientific achievement, diplomatic popularity, raw conquest, or a tally of points at the end of the year 2050 ad. every civilizations unique abilities, units, buildings, or tile improvements correlate accurately to history, and the way that civilization gained power in our world usually ends up its strong suit in the alternate multiverse created with each game of civilization 5. 10/10 by far worth anyones time.",510.5
"great turned based strategy. good fun with multiplayer - but expect a chess like game, rather than full on action. very addictive and replayable.",105.5
"speaking from the perspective of someone whos never played the earlier civilization games here. the stories about civ 5 being a great time sink are incredibly true, but i find myself somewhat hard pressed to start up a new game after sinking a lot of time into my first game. just dont expect to be able to please everybody, and dont expect to be able to do all there is to do in a single campaign, and you should do just fine.",184.6

"civilization has been one of my favourite games since 1994. ive spent hundreds of hours with civilization 1, which for me was much better than sequels, i never quite liked the way 2, 3 or 4 were made. but 5 is different, and for me its a worthy successor of civ1. with god&kings and a brave new world expansions, its tons of fun to play.",443.0
"its fun but has a ton of achievements and long games. i suggest a guick game which can be chosen in set up game. the first difficulty is really easy and i suggest starting on a higher difficulty like 3.",54.8
"civ has got to be one of the best strategy games ive ever tried. turn-based and played on a hexagonal field, a bit like a board game, but the special rules in civ make you think twice before doing anything. one part of the game that i love is how you get to control every little aspect of your civ; from research and military, to social policies (communism!) and construction. another great thing is that there is a big selection of different civs, each with their own unique units and/or buildings and traits, from across time to choose from; such as 18th century america, 1st century rome, 9th century denmark, and many more, with another chunk being added with the gods and kings expac, such as 17th century sweden. also has a f*cking great soundtrack. my conclusion: if you are into other turn-based strategy games, such as total war, but want en exciting twist, try civilization 5.",189.8
"great game, one that can always be replayed and doesnt get repetetive, some aspects of the game are infuriating at points but once you get past them the game reaches a point of unparalleled enjoyment",707.5

"best strategy game, very intense, and can get addicting",81.0
"a very addictive game. countless hours of (re)playability. the gods & kings, as well as brave new world, expansion packs add so much good stuff, it is strange that some people dont have this game yet. as you can see from the amount of hours played, you will not be disappointed when you buy it. only gripe is that if you play with friends against the cpu in multiplayer, the ai is very stale. furthermore mods are not enabled for multiplayer, although they are for single player though (and irecommend the european and world maps made by the community with true placement). buy it and prepare for hours and hours of fun gameplay!",634.2

"i purchased this game recently because a friend reccomended it to me. i can definately see why he told me to get it! i really enjoy the game and i plan to buy the dlc in the future. while the game takes awhile to complete, it is still very fun to play!",27.2
"i cannot recommend this game enough. no other game allows you to feel as powerful or amazing as this game. id recommend not having a job or anything though, it sucks time into it like a black hole.",510.0
"this is my favorite civilization yet. its beautiful, fluid, and still retains the just one more turn addictiveness the series is known for. the music is outstanding as well, with themes written for each country that shift and change as you progress through the game. the new tactical warfare really makes a difference too; gone are the stacks of doom from previous games. its a meat and potatoes tactical addition that really sets this iteration apart from previous games imo. its a must-own for fans of the series or turn-based strategy in general.",307.4
"this game is really, really fun especially if you have friends to play with you. its the penultimate strategy game at the moment pretty much, and you will waste alot of time on it itll be awessssssomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.",270.5
"you assume the role of one of many great european/asian leaders to your ultimate goal. there is one goal only and that is to eradicate minorities with different means of said eradicating. you may pursue four different paths. you can dominate the sandpeople with your highly advanced weapons. you mayshow them that european/asian culture is supreme. you can trick these fellows into letting you lead the world, trough diplomacy. or the most logical, trough science. they only live in huts, right? buy this game if you enjoy bashing minorites, making fun of religion (create your own by using existing religious symbols and then rename it, hilarity ensures) and use nukes. 11/10 like age of empires with guns",390.4
"considering this is a turn based game rather than a shooter it is ridiculously addictive. ive owned each release from civ. 1 onward and have enjoyed them all. if you dont like the relatively slow start then use a small map and begin in the modern or future eras. this is a really good alternative to shooters if youre willing to think and plan, connive and weasel.",228.6

"a great play for those who are willing to stay on the same game for hours and hours. the game itself has tons of replayability, and has some great, well priced expansion packs that add even more stuff to the game.",107.4
"i can deffinitly recommend this game to all strategy game lovers, if anyone ever played any of the earlier civilization games, you should not expect it to be too much like the older ones. yet even though stuff has been changed or even taken away, that is more than outweighed by new additions, extremely well done graphics, the new soundtracks, and the new combat system.",332.3
"seriously? its civ 5. if you dont own this game already,you have something wrong with your head brain. if you ever wanted to nuke ghandi, backstab boudicca, and setup trade agreements with geroge washington all in the same turn, this is your game. if you ever wanted to invade rome with a mix of spearman and tanks, well youre stupid, but buy this game. if you havent bought this game, buy this game.",237.2
"the king of round-based strategy games suited for beginners and experts this game offers hundreds of hours of empire-building, diplomacy and war. brave new world is strongly recommended, as it adds a lot of fun features. civ5 also supports mods, but only in singleplayer. 9/10",252.3

"way too much time spent playing this, great game for long trips.",181.8
"this game really drove the sid meier experiance home. sometimes whille playing i really did feel like i was becoming sid meier. its hands down the most realistic simulation game since fez ii so it was basically real life. at some points of game play i literally thought my name was sid meier, so that means the graphics in the game look so real that it makes you feel like youre in real life...for real. thats why i give this game: 8 cans of mountain dew / 3 family sized bags of doritos. graphics:real life gameplay:1 commentary:63 directors cut:9.9999999 story: dank/10 verdict:yea",240.7
"still one of the top turn based strategy games of all time. every revision has its own merits; and though some woudl argue as to whether they have improved with each iteration, i certainly tink they have. it still has the same adicting one more turn aspect of all civilization games. you will spend hours and hours playing a single game.",99.2

"really great game! one of the very best turn-based strategy games. the only problem i myself have is that the ai is attacking me out of no-where and its not possible to make a no-aggression packt. (itd be great, tho.) however, really enjoyable game with lots of thinking. (normal civ v - no dlcs or addons.)",283.9

"when superstorm told me to get civ v, i didnt think it was an invitaion to become and all-powerful god. this strategy game provides the experience of becoming an influential, powerful leader from history. you can declare war, trade, conquer, and make powerful allies. one con is that its really upsetting to lose a game after youve worked really hard, so if youre new to civ v prepare for the worst. overall, this game was exciting, interesting, thrilling, and has amazing graphics. 9/10.",47.8
"i enjoy playing this game because i like the idea of being able to develop technologies and advance through the eras. i also enjoy attacking enemy units but find it annoying when i usually lose the battles even with the advantage. overall, i think that it is a pretty good turn based strategy game.",356.1
"do you enjoy not bathing, having cancer, or fighting over the city of buttfart for hours with your friends? if you answered yes to any of these questions or if you really enjoy crying yourself to sleep in a hot sweat of frustration and disapointment, then this game is for you! this game is great, it has caused me to permanently damage my mouse and my self esteem during the countless temper tantrums that this game promoted! i was meant to be the supreme leader of a great nation but instead i sat and watched the glorious cities of buttfart, fatnut, and dickblood get defiled by the japanese. sid meier is a sick man and so was ghandi.",106.8

"civ v is an incredibly addicting game, with solid diplomatic and military fighting dynamics, along with excellent visuals and simple menus. be warned, though, that the ais seem to be the largest s when it comes to asking for gold and when making dead. im looking at you, china! anyways, its a great game if you enjoy strategy.",434.9
"addictive. watch your afternoon turn into the evening while trying to survive the world stage! the dlc is a must as it completely revolutionizes the game. sad about the mac version not having mod support unless you get tricky with the files, but even then it causes instability. still glad to have it on both devices.",118.4
"this game is a sleep destroyer, be prepared to lose your life if you start a game. it starts as one more turn, then ends tomorrow . if this game teaches you anything its dont trust the french or gandhi!",274.8
"i love this game of stratagy and thinking ahead. its good for training yourself to think ahead and think what your opponets might do next.",12.4
"single player is fun, i have been playing it a lot the past week and even though i feel like i still dont get everything i dont have to in order for it to be fun. after getting a really good deal for the game and all existing dlc, i feel like i havent even scratched the surface in things i can do. only major complaint i have is that players online suck. not as players, though they will mostly pick overpowered civs to try to compensate for something... no... as people they do. they will quit the first time something doesnt go their way (lose units to barbarians cause they are being dumb, lose out on a world wonder they were building, etc) to the point where you are playing against all ai before you can even build up an army to face the other civs. that takes all the fun out of trying to play online.",417.5
"an excellent strategy and conquest game, completely worth the 20$.",169.3
"its a very good game. time consumer yes. can take a whole weekend on a single game. not the best when playing only against ai opponents, religion is kind a dumb system if compared to civ iv, also why no technology trading? still i recommend this game.",199.2
"10/10. best time travel simulator 2086. i once started a game of civ, and when i stopped, it was several months later. a really good game can get you up to ten years into the future. some say a perfect one can actually take you into omnitime and actually reverse and go back. i reccomend this.",343.4

"lots of land to explore, lots of different civilizations to play and ways to improve your growing kingdom. this game does take a bit of time to play, but it is rewarding for all the hours you put into it. this was the first civilization game i played and it taught me some things in history that i didnt know. with all the content put into this game (now including dlc brave new world and mods) this game should keep you busy for quite a while.",189.4

"the biggest problem with civ. 5, is that the game is borderline bland and boring without any of the incredible dlc. though with all of those(which if you buy on a steam sale wont be to pricy)put together, you get a beautifully crafted turn-based trategy game that demands hundreds of hours to be put into and always lets the player find something new when they play it. it also very easily teaches the player to play, with difficulty levels going from very beginner to experienced master civilization 5 is a wonder of a game that demands attention.",586.8

"amazing game to play with friends or single player",85.2
"if you like long drawn-out strategy games and building things, then this is the perfect game for you. the biggest difference of civ v with its predecessors is immersion. when playing civ v, its very easy to become emotionally attached to your civilization. be ware, however, that civ v is long and drawn out, even on quick mode. a full-scale game can often last weeks and even months, and its difficult to keep your body alive while partcipating in a game of civ v.",189.2

"it was once said that man can be entertained for hours on end with the simple image of boobs. while this is true, man gains nothing from this other than an erection, dirty tissues and a hard to explain smell on his . purchasing this game is not only a visual pleasure for your brain. it helps you understand that 10 hours in a chair can really mean something. your wife or significant other may leave you due to the new smell that has appeared. but at least you can cleanse the land of all that oppose you without being called a racist or going to jail.",73.8
"controlling your own civilization? who wouldnt love that? and with the expansion packs you can just keep going forever. you can also get the satisfaction of beating your militaristic friends with science. there is only one thing i dont like about this game...those damned barbarians",57.6
"best strategy game ive ever played, its silly how addicting this game is. once you start a game and you get into it - you instantly forget about time.",105.2
"one of the best games ive ever played. if you get the chance to buy this game, do it. youll pay for every move you make, weather it be good or bad. also, playing as different civilizations gets you special rewards and perks depending on how you like to play. pick it up now!",37.3
"i pour hours and hours into this game at a time! i get so distracted and sucked into, i have no idea why.",60.2
"yaw dis shizz be a pretty good strat 11/10 would play again",297.2
"i love this game by far the best game you can get for wartime fun. the strategy that goes into building your empire up and making everyone happy and fat with food. after you build it up i normaly shot for a fight to death to see who wins and its epic the way you feel after beating the  out of your bff in multi player.",538.6
"95 out of 100 i definatly like the turn based play because it gives a refreshing change from the real time stratagy games i usually play. it can be a little repetetive playing against the computer though so try playing it with others for variety.",110.7
"this game is very entertaining, and i recomend it to anyone. i dont like turn based games, but this game is so well done and so entertaining that i never even notice that i have to wait for turns. the npcs move so fast, its almost like you never stop being in control. there are so many unique strategies to follow and the outcome of any two games are never alike. this is a spectacular game, and if i were you, i would seriously consider getting it.",19.2
"one of my favorite games ever. civ v features such great variety that you can play for 600 hours (like i have) and it still feels fresh. the game is well rounded and each of the victory options is obtainable in an enjoyable fashion. each civ for the most part feels different, and most are tailored to a specific victory type. the ai is strong and on higher difficulties very capable of beating you, however its through boosts not skill.",842.9
"one of the best turn based strategy games i have ever played, each game will be different and unique to its map and a.i. personalities.",43.6
"i have played civilization since the original version and love it to this day. this version has some drastic changes that are unique in the series but is still very much civilization. highly recommended.",876.6
"for those who knows how to think! not best in series but almost incredible with new dlc.",152.9
"definitely a must buy as it really worth the price you pay for. a game that uses strategy and planing in order to conquer or achieve a certain objective. isnt it everyone dream to take over the world or being the leader of an advance nation? well at least for me :). if single player is just not your thing, get a bunch of friends and start teaming up or backstabbing them in the back to gain control in multiplayer :) do remember is just a game though dont get serious when one bite your back haha. great game, for those who enjoy turn base and strategy game :) . it so interesting till you dont realize you have played it for hours haha",119.8
"brave new world expansion just made this game even better. ever wanted to play and take part in a subtle satire towards western worlds policy of subtle collonisation? finally i can be a coward and hide behind trade sanctions and luxuary bannings. starving millions and salting the earth of my enemies take that darius!",293.7
"if your looking for a game that lets you literally rule an entire empire againest other empires through the test of time, then you should give this game a go. its very addictive and will make you keep going turn through turn, only to look at the clock to realise what felt like and hour, turned into seven instead.",184.6
"be very careful playing this game!!! you make think you know what time it is, time to nuke gandhi, but you realize that 3 days have passed since you have started your game and you havent drank or ate in the last 18 hours. this game keep you saying just one more turn! but dont let it make your decisions for you, like when you should use the bathroom or when you should get another sandwich. if you see this game on sale buy it immediately, oh and brave new world did amazing things for this game, buy it as well.",133.5
"with gods and kings and brave new world, this game is the finished product. cant recomendi it enough for turn based stragety fans. a giant that will be hard to beat for 6.",203.7
"great game, has its flaws but makes up for it with its great replayability. its even more fun if you play it with friends.",163.6
"civ v is a a great game, provided you have the gods and kings, and brave new world expansions. vanilla civ v is clunky and incomplete. but with the addition of the two expansions this game turns from a dud into the best game in the franchise. i highly recommend buying this with the two expansions, if you can afford it.",309.5
"one of the best, long running franchises in gaming history. a must have title for gamers of all types.",806.1
"this one perhaps the greatest strategy game of all time. strategy is indeed a huge part of the game, but psychology also is, especially when playing with friends. it has enormous depth, gold edition, including science, economy, happiness, combat and so on. the game is fun singleplayer, but online with others, preferablly 3 or more, it becomes one of the best of all time. nothing is more satisfying than leading your people to a glorious victory, by conquering others in the process or researching the most of the world.",51.0
"great game, will kill time immensily. great replay value a def. must buy.",45.8
"civ (civ-v / civ-5) with all the dlcs brings back everything you had in civ-4, but with a bit more polish. if you can score this with gods & kings together on sale, grab it if you like the civ franchise.",427.9
"sid. meiers. civilization. i think that just about sums it up, doesnt it?",131.6
"incredibly in-depth, tactical experience, unrivalled by any game ive played to date. its epic in scale, fantastic in gameplay and huge in scope and size. purely magnificent.",114.1
"great game. make sure you get all the expansions in order to get the best out of it :)",237.2
"this game is highly addicting and insanely fun. 1000/10. advised to buy on sale as its pricey as fudge.",63.4
"if i had to be fair, to play this game you should have six or more hours to spare. the time goes by fast but the game its a blast. do not trust ghandi.",68.8
"boring kelley a$$ game that is only good for one playthrough. dont regret the purchase though.",90.2
"this is an amazing game, i would recommend buying it. if you do buy it, make sure you have friends to play it with as it is much more fun with friends.",78.2
"amazing game. addictive and really fun. dont start playing right before finals week",33.7
"as someone who was never big on turn-based strategy games before i played this, i can honestly say this is probably the best strategy games i have ever played, the mechanics synergise so well together, and whether working together or against each other, you can have an amazing amount of fun with your friends on this. buy it for the love of of all that is good and pure.",40.2
"great game, just what i expected. series hasnt lost a step since the 90s",505.5
"10/10 great gameplay, fun with friends and incredibly addicting.",136.9
"dont buy it. it will consume your life jk its a ton of fun...until youre up until 3am saying 1 more turn",363.2
"i do injoy the game style of the game, as being both challenging and fun is aways a plus in a turn based game.",41.1
"this game is great for people who are first-time strategy gamers. the idea of the time line (from begining of civilization, to the future) is very rare. for all i know this is the only game that has this time line.",343.4
"this game is really fun and you can spend hours playing a single round. i reccoment getting all the dlcs when their on sale, the dlcs are really good and add alot of content. the only thing i dont like is that the ai isnt very agressive.",138.7
"wow, this game is sooooooo addicting! play it, play it now! (i sold my car to buy the game and expansion packs)",164.8
"remember the good ol days of playing age of empires for hours on end, and still barely scratching the surface? well now imagine that you do the same thing but you havent even seen the surface yet. civ v is one of the best, and in-depth, strategy games ive played. its a classic example of oh ill just play for an hour or so and the next thing you know the sun is rising and youve been up all night declaring war and toppling empires. highly addictive, enormous fun, and multiplayer is brilliant, even locally. this game is worth whatever the price tag says.",16.2
"civilization v is where you come to pour tons and tons of important hours of you life into an amzing game. its worth it i promise. this is basically a electronic boardgame about the revolution of civilizations. you can play as any world leaders or your own character, and develop through time goes. each turn equals to a year. and this game is very interesting, you can either be a warmonger and claim all the land or be friends with everyone and be very kind and work deep into politics. declare war and trade all day and build until you fly into space itself. civ v is a good game. so just buy it already. 9/10",177.3
"no other game feels as epic. the feeling of building a great empire that can stand the test of time is really where civilization 5 shines.",261.7
"you get addicted, but its a good addiction, and you should accept it",113.3
"spectacularly fun, ridiculously addicting - you should just get the brave new world expansion to start out with; the original and 1st expansion (gods and kings) still left the game a bit crippled with frustratingly random ai behavior, but the gameplay feels very solid and complete now. huge time sink :d",497.5
"worth it, goty of the year of the game is good buy is good i play you play? you play you buy... you buy.",61.9
"it is amazing there is two dlc for it and that adds so much, but even with out the dlc it is still amazing you can play together to who will win. you can amercia rule money and many armys also so many other countrys.",314.1
"this is an incredible game with a nice user-friendly interface and complex strategies. a lot of fun in multiplayer...defiently worth every penny :d",195.2
"addictingly brilliant. ive lost entire days playing this, and i have no intentions of stopping anytime soon. each playthrough, leader, map, and (perhaps most wonderfully) mod, presents a new an unique experience.",195.5
"i really went out of my comfort zone when i asked for this game as a gift, and i must say that i love this game. fairly engaging, good depth, and countless ways to go about tending to your civilization. +++ recommend buying for all types of gamers!",104.5
"one of the best games ever if you have a nice group of friends to play with. me and my pals play all the time. worth the buy. also note you do not need gold to get brave new world",161.0
"great game that you can play multiple times and each time is different.",644.0
"the game is amazing, very difficult to tear yourself away once you get going. the expansion packs are highly recommended as well!",765.8
"what can you say about civ v? if you dont already have this....buy it. addictive as anything and so much fun. yes its an rts but the turns dont get in the way. you will want to win on each and every civilization available.",97.1
"this game is time consuming. never start a game if you have plans in atleast 4 hours! i have no regrets though... my friends? maybe...",53.3
"this game is really bad for my character. every time i play it i become insane and just kill everyone in the game.",17.4
"i dont think there has ever been a game that makes me lose track of time as much as this.",670.9
"one of my favorite games on steam. much improved from civ 4 and easier for the regular player to pick up if you like any kind of rts or city building game then this is for you. its basically a much simpler version of the total war games.",157.6
"this is a turn-based settling/fighting game in which you are a random world leader from a random time period and you build an empire and then you kill each other. what more could you want from a game? computerboardgamewoohoo mine mine mine mine mine mine ~seagulls (finding nemo)",105.3

"its good if you are up for a game that lasts for a while and constant initial lag when u rejoin later in the game.",130.8
"i absolutly (pretty sure im going to spell stuff wrong but whatever) love the gameplay and the history aspect of the game. people who like turn based stratagy games like xcom: enemy unkown would really like this game exept in civ you have more control of everything that is happening unlike xcom. i bet some of you guys watch youtube vids on this and look at it thinking it is a very complex and hard to understand game but it is a lot simpler than it looks. i have over 100 hours on this game and i have even gotten some dlcs. i even got some of my friends to get the game and play with me. in all i find it a really fun game and i give it a 10/10.",261.9
"... stay back.... get away from this game... once you pay the money to buy it you will download it... start it.... pick your favorite civ... after a couple of turns an hour or two pasts by... you dont realize the time..... next thing you know your being attacked by china because she is a  who betrays good friends of her and then try to kill you. stay away from this game do not buy it if you do you will go crazy and start to mutter about iron and uranium to nuke china underbreath everyday.... watch out for ghandi",70.4

"this game is the best game ever made! chose what sort of game style you want to have, diplomatic, trade or use brute force, to gain control over the world. this game i came back to many times. it comes many new games, to to try out. but if you buy this game you have a game that you always will come back too. if you are new to this sort of games, just play it on a easy difficulty, and you be just fine. this game gets new dlc all the time, and its community, build new maps, challanges for you to try out. its always something new to come back too. build an army of warriors, or convert the world to youre religion to get the upper hand. its the best game here on steam.",309.9
"for anyone who wants to conquer the world, to make it a better place, or bring peace to a war torn land. this is the game for you. running your own country is unlike anything to come to the market.",165.1

"still the best long-run turn based strategy game series in existance. this version perfects many of the issues the prior iterations had and adds a ton of new content.",177.0

"basically, cause there are nukes n stuff. plus its extremely moddable",165.1
"the best strategy games/series... one of the best games. will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. puts the best of military strategy together with things like cultural and technological strategy and adds diplomacy (a little lacking but game play makes up for it) to create one of, if not the, best games i have ever played. the internal improvements, such as wonders and buildings, and choosing how to shape your civilization towards a certain victory condition even adds to the strategy. throw in the goty edition, along with g&k and bnw and you have a highly developed and emerged strategy game that will give you thousands of hours of entertainment. each civilization gives you a completely different experience and there are hundreds upon hundreds of combinations you can try. the dlc may get a little pricey, and the ai has some issues, but it is still, by far, one of my favorite games.",513.1
"this game lets you act out your anger on the chinese by building a mass army and taking over their cities and renaming them stuff like land of the small weewees 10/10 goty",35.2

"my favourite civilization game yet. 10/10 would buy for a friend.",391.4
"great game for anyone looking for either a casual game to have fun in, or a bit of a slow paced, intense strategy game. able to play for countless hours in one session and it never gets boring. i would comepletely reccomend this game for anyone interested in this style of game.",68.1
"addictive like previous civ titles, ive easily spent more time on this than i would ever want to admit. does take a little bit of getting used to though, as you can no longer stack units. still a ton of fun though, and id highly recommend it.",61.4
"ceaser got mad at me and his legionares destoryed my longswordmen but when i got my minutmen out i wiped the floor with him.i made a peace treaty with him to have a age of peace if he would give me all his cites but his current main one (which was not rome cause i took it from him) and i burnt down the cites he gave me and then started a siege on his last remaining city (destroying the truce) that was the end of ceaser.but egypt got mad and called me dishonorible after the actions i took.then i pause and saved and never went on it again.ask jordan nutkicker if you dont belive me!",73.1

"great game but will take a some time to finish it...",90.2
"one of the best incarnations of the civ series. i know a lot of the hardcore players mourn the loss of the unit stack, but i prefer the one unit per tile style, even if the implementation has a few issues. with so many difficulty options, i recommend this to just about anyone. start on the easy difficulty and work your way up. im still missing a win on the absolute top difficulty, but ill get it eventually!",195.6
"this is a very entertaining game. i find it very challenging, though that may say more about me as a player than it does about the game. its a very good game from a genre i dont typically enjoy.",76.8
"i will say this once, get this game, realy fun with or without friends, great strategy game. all around 9/10 stars. has some multiplayer bugs with the more people/bots in the game.",249.2

"great turn based strategy game. very in-depth with lots of worthwhile dlc available that adds significatly to gameplay.",201.2
"hands down the best strategy game you will play. given the complexity of the game, the learning curve is steep, but not that steep. ive invested 200+ hours into the game and am still learning new things. many improves in v make this game not only more approachable, but tactically different than its predecessors. various victory conditions and civilizations to play make this game such an amazing feat by firaxis games. a must buy!",314.6
"never played a civ game before i played this one and it is a lot of fun. even without the dlc i played about 40 hours and with the expansions it is even more addicting. i bought it when it was on sale, but its definitely worth full price.",228.0
"civilization series were always the most addicting, difficult and rewarding games ever. civilization 5, alone or with gods and kings & brave new world is the most time consuming devil that posses your time and will never give it back. although your only way to resist is to click next turn and bring glory to your civilization. most complex game with many victory types, strategies, difficulty levels (from easiest for even strategy noobies to most experienced generales who were raised with rts by their sides), units, resources, everything... this game has everything that us - nerds love. and you can read a book in one time while playing on huge map around atomic era :d",175.3
"amazing game that forces you to balance between being nice with others and destroying your enemies to expand your empire.",425.6
"awesome game with the dlc but the standard version is missing a lot of stuff from older civs. buy in bundle if price is reduced, but not only main game.",120.1
"its like risk, but no one is liable to flip the table on you! the dlc is must have and the workshop community downloads are great for improving or mixing things up!",598.9
"really enjoyable game, extremely easy to sink hours and hours into it thanks to its good replay value.",296.1
"solid strategy game, but make sure you have time on your hands if you want to jump into this game. although it is quite time consuming, the size of this game is just unbelievable. a whole variety of civilizations, maps, victory types and military units cause you to mix different strategies to best conform with the current world, which is pretty swell.",201.2
"this game is an incredible game that appeals to those who love politics, strategy, and ideals of world domination. build a nation from the ground up and conquer the world with your military, your nations culture, or your amazing diplomatic powers. one of my favorites ever this game has certainly made me into a civilization fan.",107.4
"amazing. thats all i can label it as. nothing is more fun than watching your enemies capital be ingulfed by a mushroom cloud from your nuclear arsenal. with plenty of modding capabilities, the possibilities for this game are endless. this game overs a great variety even without mods too! will you be a kind and benevolent leader, or a merciless tyrant? will you be a religious fanatic, or a rational heretic? will you pull the world into nuclear conflict, or make world peace? will you stomp upon those weaker than you, or will you make allies and fight the neverending war machine? will you build a nation, that will stand the test of time?",137.3
"the best strategy game ever created! it is extremely fun and interesting, you will find yourself playing it for hours! the possibilities are endless in civ 5. it is beginner-friendly as there is a bunch of hints and information that the game provides you as you play. setting up a game is easy, there are also many options you can tweak to make your world what you want it to be. the dlc for this game is awesome and it adds even more variety to this game. steam workshop also adds mods to this game that you can download and have even more fun exploring civ 5. make your civilization grow from the ancient era to the future! you will find yourself addicted and going to the next turn and then the next turn. multiplayer with your friends is very fun and you can team up! overall, this game is worth it and i recommend civ 5 to everyone!",99.0
"honestly, if you are fan of stategy games, civ 5 is for you. bots can actually be a challenge sometimes, but by far the most enjoyable way to play civ is with friends. a huge selection of civilizations to choose from, all with their own perks and specials. game mechanics make sense to the idea of the game - to lead a civilization throughout history. better yet, like many steam games, the workshop for this game is great. makes it just that much more replayable.",638.5
"outstanding woooo! after 2 years 2k games finally fixed the multiplayer! now you can play with more than 4 people! and it actually works once in awhile! amazzinngggg p.s. brave new world is great fun, but venice is overpowered and broken in multiplayer",724.4

"this is the latest incarnation of the civilization series. pick your ruler, build your cities, expand your borders and prepare for war. the game can be long and involved (about 30 hours to complete on the largest maps), but provides a lot of variety due to the different leaders available and the many ways one can use to win the game (culture, war, a vote in the un, or via science).",178.3

"my review of civ v: this game is amazing!! basically what you do is: grow your empire, make friends with other empires. and when the time comes, you could fight with all the opposing empires once you have built your army. it was surprising how each country had different looking military, this game is unique and fun! definitely recommend worth your $30, go check it out its awesome and epic and is the best strategy game ive ever come across in my life. not even exaggerating, this game is so beautiful and just epic go for it",36.2

"this game is great! a lot of people claim to like civ 4 better, but i kind of like 5. it is a little simpler to manage your empire, city-states are a great addition, and the new combat system requires a bit more skill (no more unit stacking). if you have played the older versions, youll love 5... and if you havent, i would probably recommend started with 5 over 4 :)",522.4

"addictive and well made. cant wait for the next civ",31.3
"this is really an upgrade from the old versions. the complexity and multitudes in achieving victory combined with the different civilizational aspects provides an extreme diversity in each game. the multiplayer experience is really the pinnacle of what started as civnet. this game is truly enjoyable in the company of friends in multiplayer mode.",80.9

"i dont really like turn based games, but this game is differnent and i love the way there are progression trees for both policies and tech, thus maximizing possibilites for each player in the game. the multiple victory conditions are also good as they variate how people play the game so it is not repetitive and not everyone has the same goals. there are plenty of civilizations to choose from ranging from england to even civilizations like the zulu. unfortunatly i find multiplayer can be a bit poor because the games can last a long time and people like to quit, i find this makes it best to play with your friends as you can save game and continue with them later.",170.2

"one of the greatest games ive ever had the pleasure of playing, a great improvement over past renditions. each expansion pack adds to the level of fun and tactics potentially involved, and given this is a strategy game, it truly does bring about amazingly nail biting moments, either in a fantasy world, or reliving/rewriting history.",878.1
"awsome game can be simple or complex as you like at the easy diffculty. but at the top levels you need to be on the ball every move. the game allows you to be in control as much as you like from choosing citizen output. all the way to let me make the key choices. it simply is one of the best strategy games in my opinon.",72.9

"civilization v is a great game but with out the dlcs is a unfinished game that may disappointfans coming from civ iv. but of course with the dlc it turned this unfinished game into a spectacular experiance that any civilization fan should have. it has a dumbed down ui from civ iv but thats what all the games are doing so you gotta deal with it. the main point is you have to get the dlc to see the full potential of this game or else you may be left unsatisified with the gameplay. pros: -good gameplay on single and multi -easy to ui for new players -great dlcs that are worth the $30.00 -constant replayebility -great community content on workshop and easy to use map editor cons: -dumb and random ai behaviour -multiplayer session lag and disconnect oftan making it sometimes unplayable -to easy to play in even the hardest modes - not enough stratigic resources 8.5/10 get this game civilization fans!!!",344.7
"very good game. good value for the price. i have been playing several full games with different starting civilizations, trying new tactics each time. each type of victory is a goal to achieve in itself and some can be harder to achieve than others. the ais are not super smart, but can still be provide a challenge sometime.",66.9

"certainly a fun game. it is fabulous to declare war with everyone on the first turn and win the game. add some friends into the mix for more awesome. i would not recommend this game to someone who is not patient. games take upwards of 3+ hours to complete on average.",46.9

"ive been playing civ since microproses first game. boy, since the second one, civ v is the most inovative yet loyal to original game general dinamics. purists will initially dislike the abundance (or mere existence) of city-states, but once you start playing youll see they contribute enormously to the game balance and a more dynamic early game stage. if wou like turn base strategy games, civilization v is mandatory.",53.4
"hands down an amazing game, with hundreds of replayable hours to be had. each play through entails something different, sometimes providing frustrations (i.e wonder stealing and barbarian raids) but most of the time giving a very enjoyable gameplay experience. online play is where this game peaks, get together with friends and have sessions as you advance through the ages and have a very good time. a definate jewel of a strategy game.",142.9

"you thought you were going to do something today? nope.",132.7
"i love it. its an easy-to-use turn-based strategy game that changes each time you play. each update is an attempt to balance civilizations, which is good. it also has a lot of distance between each new iteration; civilization iv was years and years ago, so its not like theyre pumping out low-quality products for a quick buck. my complaints are that this new game put features of the old game into dlc, like religion. its also completely eliminated corporations (though a new take on it comes along in brave new world). overall, its a good game, but get the bundle at a discount.",499.9

"probably one of the most intricate and long going series i have had the pleasure to enjoy. from the start, the game may seem dull as a turn based strategy game, but in reality, as the game progresses, it shows that it has so much more to offer than another rock paper scissors strategy game. with elements such as international politics, a growing economy and a range of technological pursuits, the true value of this game lies in its replayability and potential gameplay styles. with that said, it can be a slow paced game, which isnt for everyone, though i have hardly had more fun with my friends over a few drinks. a fully reccomended game for anyone who likes strategy games, and more so if you enjoy watching the asension and decline of humanity through its many civilisations. -keon",134.4

"this game is awesome. i love how it takes time to build up, and you can go from the primted, to the very advanced. the only thing i see weird in it, is when the ai leaders denouce you for no reason when your already friendly with them, besides that i think the game is perfect. heres a tip, when playing on two player, make sure you have your food right next to you eatting it all day because thats how long the game takes to finsh. i love and you will to.",99.8

"10/10 civ v is, hands down, one of the best pc games ive ever played. ive never experienced vanilla civ v, but ive put in a lot of time into gods and kings, which was pretty fun (a little slow at times with not as much micromanaging), and brave new world, which gave the game, to me, a lot more playability (added quite a few new features which i enjoy thoroughly), especially due to the amount of gold it allows to be accumulated. i definitely recommend getting both of the dlc for this game, as each adds a little more that brings it closer to perfection. my only complaint is that it can still get pretty slow, but its hardly a deterrent from loving this game. add a bit more micromanaging, and its golden.",219.5
"well made game with a mostly intuitive interface and great game mechanics. some minor glitches that can be resolved with mods and it just feels so satisfying taking over another civilization and claiming the continent to yourself! also the interaction between leaders adds an interesting perspective and convinces you that these are real civilizations you are blowing up with your giant death robots.",42.3

"a brilliant game. on the higher levels, it is challenging, yet just as addictive. multiplayer gameplay is amazing, especially with expansion packs enabled, however, make sure you (and your partner/s) have a stable internet connection, as the game may have a tendancy to drop mid-way through. there are many mods available for this game and i adivse you all to check them out. i am an avid fan of sid meier and cannot wat to see what they come out with next. definately recommended.",130.9

"way too much time spent playing this, great game for long trips.",181.8
"this game really drove the sid meier experiance home. sometimes whille playing i really did feel like i was becoming sid meier. its hands down the most realistic simulation game since fez ii so it was basically real life. at some points of game play i literally thought my name was sid meier, so that means the graphics in the game look so real that it makes you feel like youre in real life...for real. thats why i give this game: 8 cans of mountain dew / 3 family sized bags of doritos. graphics:real life gameplay:1 commentary:63 directors cut:9.9999999 story: dank/10 verdict:yea",240.7
"still one of the top turn based strategy games of all time. every revision has its own merits; and though some woudl argue as to whether they have improved with each iteration, i certainly tink they have. it still has the same adicting one more turn aspect of all civilization games. you will spend hours and hours playing a single game.",99.2

"well worth the price. ive already gotten my moneys worth from this game and am nowhere near done playing it, i forsee dropping over 1000 hours in this game.",156.5
"really great game! one of the very best turn-based strategy games. the only problem i myself have is that the ai is attacking me out of no-where and its not possible to make a no-aggression packt. (itd be great, tho.) however, really enjoyable game with lots of thinking. (normal civ v - no dlcs or addons.)",283.9

"when superstorm told me to get civ v, i didnt think it was an invitaion to become and all-powerful god. this strategy game provides the experience of becoming an influential, powerful leader from history. you can declare war, trade, conquer, and make powerful allies. one con is that its really upsetting to lose a game after youve worked really hard, so if youre new to civ v prepare for the worst. overall, this game was exciting, interesting, thrilling, and has amazing graphics. 9/10.",47.8
"i enjoy playing this game because i like the idea of being able to develop technologies and advance through the eras. i also enjoy attacking enemy units but find it annoying when i usually lose the battles even with the advantage. overall, i think that it is a pretty good turn based strategy game.",356.1
"do you enjoy not bathing, having cancer, or fighting over the city of buttfart for hours with your friends? if you answered yes to any of these questions or if you really enjoy crying yourself to sleep in a hot sweat of frustration and disapointment, then this game is for you! this game is great, it has caused me to permanently damage my mouse and my self esteem during the countless temper tantrums that this game promoted! i was meant to be the supreme leader of a great nation but instead i sat and watched the glorious cities of buttfart, fatnut, and dickblood get defiled by the japanese. sid meier is a sick man and so was ghandi.",106.8

"(reviewed with gods+kings expansion) this game has sucked over 40 hours of my life in the last 2 weeks. it brings the just one more turn addiction that i felt with civ 2 and alpha centauri, as well as updated gameplay and strategy. at first i didnt like the dumbed down tech tree, but its grown on me. i have few complaints about the game--the automated city manager is adequate, alliances with the ai seem hardly useful (you hit endgame and they will backstab you. or maybe thats just koreas mo. in. every. game), and it appears you can game the new combat system something fierce (i field at most 3-7 units to defend my empire, regardless of empire size). i have to admit i really enjoy the fact that civ has finally gone hexagonal.",194.1
"great game very easy to sink several hours into it without even realizing it",299.6
"civilization v is a solid game. not too much more to say. its fun to play vanilla, with many different ways of achieving victory (culture, science, and domination, for example) and no two games turn out quite the same. then when you include mods into the equation, and you get even more playtime and fun. i recently played a match as the kingdom of rohan on an 80x80 hex map of middle earth, and man was that fun. there are also mods that add enhanced functionality, unique units, gui tweaks, and a whole slew of other changes that serve to spice up the experience. definitely a solid pick up. however, id definitely advise getting gods and kings with it at the very least. the gods and kings expansion adds a lot of content to the game that was sorely needed, and they have added even more content to it with the newest expansion brave new world.",34.5

"definitly one of the greatest games of all time. playing as some of the greatest civilizations ever to walk the earth you must race for victory. unlike some games, in this there is multiple paths to take on your way to victory, including scientific advancement, taking over the world, and discovering the united nation. this game never gets old and is always fun to play.",390.6
"sid meiers latest entry in the award winning civilization series is fantastic. it allows you to rule a country however you would like, be it peacefully allying yourself with others or steamrolling them with the feet of your armies. the two expansions, although steeply priced, is a must for the full experience and i reccomend the dlc strongly. if you love 4x games and have a lot of money in gifted steam cards, than i highly reccomend considering civilization v. however, if you couldnt put a lot of time into one saved game (a standard game could be awhile,) then you might want to look at less time intensive titles. 10/10",791.3

"all time favorite game, ive palyed for hundreds of hours always on huge and have yet to finish a game, but its about as perfect as a game has ever been to me. if you like strategy with actual diplomacy and trade, this game with all of its expansions accomplishes it.",425.1

"as a mind games lover i highly reccomend this game even if you one of the people who dont love looking up for many tutorials and guides to play a game. this game briliant once you play it you cant get enought as some one who made more then 10 saves atleast and still every new game is more crazy then the other just the felling from making your first city with one population all the way to a huge empire with an advanced army. i highly reccomend this game to everyone no metter what types of game you love action,adventure or any other type this game is fun for everyone.",224.5
"this game never ends and is very addicting first game set it to random lasted 15hrs totaly worth the buy but id say till it goes on sale so you can buy all the dlc and the game cheaply",33.6

"if youre looking for a stratagy game, you came to the right place. civs easy-to-learn hard-to-master controls and mechanics make it one of my favorite stratagy games. i honestly did not expect to enjoy this game as much as i have. the ai is clever and unexpected, the gameplay is fun, especially in single player, and multiplayer is... mostly stable. the game does sometimes randomly disconnect you from games, however its not too difficult to just reconnect. also, in multiplayer turns can go on for quite a while, especially considering some players have more to do than others, so sometimes you end up sitting around doing nothing, however this is a problem with most/all turn based games. all problems aside, its a great stratagy game.",135.4
"dont let your guard down.... especially raging barbarian they will always haunt you, steal your worker, raze your city, and dont be friend with askia.. damn i still grudging him until now",675.7
"this is an addictive turn-based strategy game that will keep you at your computer for hours at at time! i always find myself saying ill play just one more turn, then ill get off then i find myself playing 15-20 more turns before i finally pull myself away. this is because theres always something interesting happening during every turn and you feel the need to take advantage of it. this game also has low specifications, so you dont need a super fast computer to play it. fun, immersive, historical, and captivating - definitely worth the price!",161.3

"very fun game. youll find yourself playing for long periods at a time for what will seem like 30 minutes for you. you will get addicted to it and want to finish the game before you do anything else. even when you finish your first match you might want to play again. theres no problem with that either as there different ai difficulties , randomly genrated maps and varing civs with there own special perks.once youve mastered all of that you can try to mod the game , this game has many creative and smart players that made there own custom maps , civs or scenarios. if you have a friend thats plays the game you could play with them. if you are a stratagy game fan or just like the feeling of creating your own empire and nation then this is a can not miss.",259.3
"the greate and best strategy ever! there are a lot of kinds of development of ur state in this game. you can become a rich person and make boom to other countries. on the other hand u can fight for every piece of land and struggle seemingly insignificant from the poor state. so this game is rly enjoyable and diversful!!!!!! 9.5/10",31.8

"the most time consuming game you could possibly play",369.9
"having played every iteration of the civilization franchise since the first one in 1991, i can honestly say this is the best one ever made, and not just because of improved graphics, im talking about gameplay balance and the feeling it gives you that this is a huge, deep, complex world. my one and only gripe is the excessively long load times--i had to install it on the ssd and even there it takes 15 seconds to load but thats better than 2-3 minutes.",152.8
"this is probably one of my alltime favorite games. i can spend the entire day playing this game, as you can see i have over 500 hours into it. easy controls (you only need your mouse!) it is a simple fun fast turn-based military economy nation simulator. with thousands of fun mods to pick from to play with from the steam community! i highly recommend this game to anyone interested! worth the money, and also the expansion packs to this game. it seems like a lot of money to buy it all, but at the end it is worth it!",723.4

"this game is the epitome of global conquest and strategy games. although it is turn based, it keeps you interested and intent on taking over the globe. the ai has improved tremendously, and can be extremely challenging. it features multiple difficulties, for beginners and experts, and every type of intermediate out there. this game even has a multiplayer, so buy and we can battle or work together to rule the world!",134.3
"sid meiers civilization v. some of the best money ive ever spent. hours poured into this game. i do not regret it, and neither will you when you try out this game. combine it with gods and kings and brave new world for maximum enjoyment factor. just a warning, the game is rather resource-intensive, so it may lag on lesser computers. have fun!",289.1
"its a good game overall only problems are that its hard to finish games due to connection issues and the players themselves",533.7

"civ 5 is the best 4x game ever made, better then even the great civ 5. not only does it look great it feels and plays great. get the bnw and gk to make it even better! who doesent want to be gandhi and take over the world? i would also suggest you play it with friends since back stabbing your friends never felt so good. i give it a 8.5/10 and a 9.5/10 if you got some of the dlc like bnw and gk.",687.5

"the classic sonic levels were better than the modern sonic levels",41.1
"one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing. whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out.",72.2
"very, very fun game. now, if you dont like aoe and risk type games, you wont like this, if you do, you will love this. you just have to remember, its like risk, with turns. thats about all. its like aoe because you have to get resources, ect,ect,ect. its not like either of those in the ways of creating a city, attacking, trading and research. well, its kinda, a tiny tiny bit, like aoe with the research. its like aoe with the cant see anything to start with...or at least, tell you get a satalite :) then its like you typed marco polo its like risk cuase you it takes turn, kinda like drafting, but not, its like aoe cuase you see your troops, but you have sections you can move, a amount you can move, and other things. all in all, i loved the game, would buy it again if that meant playing it and winning...again :) thanks!",22.3

(i prefer the nuclear fire off war). 9/10",621.5
"civilization v, a great improvement over civ iv, easily the best civilization to date. newbie freindly, great game mechanics, great graphics. one of the best improvements over the last few civs is the implementasions of the tiles, it makes the game much more tactical and interesting. no more can we make the stacks of death, or just steam roll our enemies without any problems. even though i havent played the civs prior to civ iv, i still think its the best civ to date.",56.2

"recommend dont critisize until youve played it good overhead strategy game which involves planning and thinking ahead of the game. graphics are fairly good for a game of this genre. there are a few bugs (mainly on multiplayer) none too noticable.. i cant go in full depth personally since i dont have a great amount of hours playing. have fun.",35.4
"i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested in history and/or wants to learn about historical figures and events. this game allows the player decide the politics of the world you are in and that is why it is one of steams best selling games.",111.9

"in the end, i got enough enjoyment out of this game to recommend it, though it still feels off and game-y - it really punishes you for doing things the wrong way, and i never really feel like i can attack anybody until civilizations have guns, when most of the appeal for me is playing as ancient empires like the romans. but anyway, its still worth playing.",38.3

"i have been a huge sid meiers fan ever since civ 2 and i love the civilization series, you can really get bored of ir and you can make your own nations and armies and attack others, control currency, build education, resources and much more. very well made game. the only thing that grinds my gears when it comes it sid meiers is that the dlc cost so much money. the gods and kings dlc is $29.99 which is the cost of the whole civilization v game itself.",10.3

"i absolutly love it!! just such a superb commbination of stratagy, history(sort of) and city domination. in my opinion brave new world has just made civ 5 even better with the addition of great people, better trading, and more civs.",64.4
"never trust washington, i know hes cute and all but...he is evil himself",31.2
"civ 5 without dlc is very fun but once you get all the dlc, theres no going back. having all the dlc maybe expensive but its 100% worth it. civ is a great, fun stragetegy game. you can play with friends, random people or just by yourself. there are 8 different difficulties so you can choose whether you want it to be easy or hard. there is a campgain so to speak that you can do. they dont follow off eachother but theyre fun. so to conclude if you like strategy games i highly recommend getting civ, lots of fun!",784.4

"probably one of the most addicting games i have ever played. i dont know about the new beyond earth coming out here but i guarentee this is the best buy i had in the last 2 years",248.8
"this game is like heroin, you just cant stop playing it. youll tell yourself just one more turn and then ill quit but later realize that youve sunken six more hours into the game. youll alienate your friends & family just so you can teach those dirty huns not to  with your cities while gandhi nukes your  of the planet. so yeah, get this game if you like doing hard drugs.",73.9

"rather honestly, this is my favorite game to play. both with and without online players, i love to play. the freedom to do what you wish and the repurcussions of those actions just make the game that much better. plus its not like the third game where you could practically pump out anything you needed, but the computers could always pump out more troops to you no matter what.",142.3
"this is one of the best games i have ever played!!!",73.6
"civ is that game you play with friends, play alone, anything at all. its fun, you like it, you buy the dlc. you then find a new civ that you like, great. but then you play a game, theres something special about it and you cant quite tell what is so awesome about it. it consumes you for a few days, ita all you can think about, all you want to do. then you win/lose and you feel as if you lost a part of yourself. because ghandi is a .",596.0
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time. i played civilization revolution on the xbox-360, so when i bought this game, i was not expecting what i recieved. i love the gameplay. the civilizations are well balanced, because one you learn how to manipulate a certain civilization, you can dominate any civilization after. all the dlcs are worth paying for. they add more funcions that caused the gameplay to change drasticaly. brave new world added trade routes and that alone can change the outcome of the game. you can have a city in the middle of the desert, but have all your other cities sending it food and production, making this city able to grow and eventually be stable on its own. love the game and if anyone wants to play with me, add me! if you have any questions about the game, ask away. 10/10 in all aspects",223.7
"if you like creating an entire civilization from the ground up, this is the game for you! just buy all the dlc/ get the gold ediion so you can enjoy every piece of it. hopefully fireaxis does civ vi right and makes the game great on release, but super awesome on all expansions after that.",280.1
"so many varied ways to play. accurate to historical content. is a lot of fun to play with friends online with only a little occasional lag. 550 played hours and still not bored with the game. great strategy based game. dont buy if you like games that dont involve lucky chance.",619.7

"where should i start? this game is absolutely amazing! it has so many things you can do. such as re-enact historical events, see what it would be like if different civilizations began in a different part of the world, or play against your friends in an intense race to see how can dominate the world. not only can you achieve domination victories, but your nation can also excel and thrive with science, cultural, and faith victories. no matter what civilization you are, you can build any world wonder you desire! as long as youre in the correct time period and meet the requirements of course. all in all this game is great fun, providing hours and hours of fun (and that will only be one game). tl:dr you can build giant death robots towards the end. 10/10.",141.0

"a hugely immersive game with endless replayability. i cant say much for the single player as ive barely touched it, but as a multiplayer game, if you have a solid 12 hours to spend with a few friends its a truly incredible experience of bonds formed and broken within the space of a mouse click. though plagued with a few problems, such as games larger than small running very slowly to begin with, and annoying restarts, it still lends itself to being one of the deepest, exciting and tactical games ive ever played. the dlc massively adds to it too.",161.1
"a fascinating game with a fantastic gameplay. a strategic and very beautiful game filled with different empires and civilizations. as i say to my friends its like chess but more advanced! and that is what it is, as nobody makes peace with the person you are playing chess with for money etc. its also amazing due to all the mods thatre very easy to download to the game, thats where i usually find realistic mods, like true start locations for real world, global warming etc. and then i play as denmark and go full viking all around the world! its an amazing game that one can use too many hours on.",735.0

"this game is absoulotly amazing it is one of the best strategy games ive played and i recommend it to anyone",117.7
"if you like turn base strategy games, this is one of the best i ever played. i reccomend this to all steam players",605.1
"civilization v updates the series to a hexagonal board that feels natural to play on. the rich style and artwork along with the graphical uplift provide a sense of maturity to the civ series. recommended to those that like era spanning strategy games as civ v finds the right blend and variety to provide endless hours of strategy.",374.3
"wow! first of sid meiers games i have played and it is superb! most strategic and entracing game ever! totally worth the money.....just wait for a sale, its a tad expensive. i bought it for $35 over christmas",29.6
"civilization v is easy to get into, but takes time to fully master. its an addicting combination of empire management and hex-based unit combat. the basic premise is that you lead a civilization from its nomadic origins through the ages. youll found cities, build grand armies, and interact with other civilizations over epic games that can span tens of hours. the games greatest strength lies in the emergent narratives that you, the player, will form as you lead your empire to greatness. you will love, curse, and despise your fellow players/ai. in some ways, civilization is indescribable. this is one of the gaming experiences you must try at least once in your life. i recommend also picking up the expansions gods & kings and brave new world for the most complete experience. p.s: make sure you set aside a few hours for this game, because you wont want to play anything else for a while.",81.4
"playing to lose or barely survive as a weak civilization in the high difficulty settings is actually quite interesting. with scenarios, real world positioning mods, and ai enhancement mods, survival through defense and diplomacy against dominant civilizations creates a different gameplay from trying to win. too bad multiplayer isnt quite feasible due to constant screen jumping to allied battle...",133.6
"never before have i played a game as majestic as this. the graphics are simply amazing, the soundtrack immerses you in the whole experience, and its the kinda game where you sit down to play, and the next thing you know its 4 am.",442.9
"this game is good. i mean if i, reggie fils-aime says it, it must be true.",20.8
"i know im late to the game (ha, literally), but i bought this game last week, and i havent been enveloped by a game this fast since skyrim. its probably not a good thing because my grades are absolutely going to tank in my last year of undergraduate studies, but its worth it. im going to drop out of college and hide in a basement playign civ 5 until i starve.",50.7
"bought this through humble bundle and enjoyed it so much i added the extra ~5$ to get the full tier. this is my first experience with a civ game and i have passed on them before because i thought it was to complex. but starting from the lowest difficulty and work your way up seems to have worked this far. the only negative i can think about, except the ais evil trading, is that it magically turns one more turn to 3am in the morning.",34.7
"i beat ghandi in a nuclear war but lost to korea in science...fml 10/10",46.7
"as much replayability as tes skyrim (witout needing any mods) this game is seirously worth the money. the game is fun, and extremely coustimizable. only downside is that the dlc is expensive",186.1
"try not to consider realife logic, for example how would your jets be damaged while attacking stone age babarians other than that kiss good bye to your life",387.6
"opened game at 6 in the evening, looked at the clock when i finally took a break, 4 in the morning. 10/10 would lose social life again.",175.9
"i have put hundreds of damned hours into this game and there is still more stuff i can do in the game. ive played plenty of games in my life but this is the best one out of all of them.",127.1
"pros: fun, addictive, steam community support, mods cons: online multiplayer is a bit buggy, it will suck your life away",248.6
"great and, in my opinion, best strategic game ive ever played. 10/10 m8!",164.3
"civilization v is possibly the greatest strategy game of all time, and certainly the best ive ever played. ive played this game for over 450 hours now, and there is still plenty that i havent seen yet. each time you play, you learn new tactics, skills and strategies to help aid you in one of the many ways to win the game. i would definitely recommend civilization v complete edition, as the dlcs greatly enchance the way you play game. if there was one game i would recommend to buy on steam, it would be this one.",523.8
"ghandi is just so kind... just look at him with all his nukes.",665.2
"this game feels like every single game in this series has been building up to this- all the positives of the series and none of the negatives. some say it has faults- and it does- but it is regardless my personal favourite civ game yet.",858.9
"this game made me think strategy games are  anymore, ghandi has nukes too. 11/10 would bang.",59.6
"literally cannot stop playing. a very fun game to play to relax and enjoy yourself. multiplayer is also really fun with lots of people. i would definitly suggest this game to anyone i meet.",118.2
"wasnt too hot on this game when it came out compared to civ4 but the gods and kings and brave new world expansions bring it over the top. while the combat grid system is a breath of fresh air to the series, im still not too keen on how slow units seem to be generated; its definitely more of an alt-victory tilted game, which suits me just fine. the variety and subtlety in gameplay definitely gets the just one more turn.. seal of approval from me!",419.2
"if you have 10 hours or so free id take the opportunity to have a quick game of civ.",147.1
"decent base game,get the 2 expantion packs to get the full experience.",385.2
"a grate game. just lose for civ ii, who was the first civ game i played. this game have a love of community content like maps, civs and game modes. the just one problem is the multiplayer mode who never should exists, this game type wont be made for multiplayer.",66.6
"one of the best games ive ever played. play it on the weekend otherwise you will wake up late for work or school scored it for 10 on summer sale, win!!!",8.8
"just another turn, and ill stop playing your mind will repeat it untill you notice you havent eat for a whole day.",140.4
"this game is my favourite game at the moment, its a good strategy game with a nice look to it. not acurate to history at all, (if you dont use mods at least). its very fun to play with friends, try not to get too competative though.",336.7
"turn based 4x strategy game, is there anything more exciting and visceral nah but really tho this game is well goooooood ive spent way too much time on it its addictive also flip u henry with ur flippin chinese domination rush also buildin the great wall u scrub",158.7
"fantastic game. very addictive. decided to play a few turns then it had been 5 hours",229.8
"one more turn my . seriously do not think you are going to just quickly make a few turns in this game and go. i once started playing at 8am thinking eh, ill play a little bit. and next thing i know it was 2pm and i was slaughtering the japanese mercilessly. this game will cause you to get fired, fail your classes, get a divorce, and nuke ghandi all at the same time. i am serious here, the commercials for this game do not lie and i have been apart of a civ 5 recovery group for a few weeks now. 15/10 would buy again.",179.9
"with no prior experience with these games, i decided to try it. i became hooked instantly. just a couple of hours and you have a basic understanding. i know people with hundreds of hours in this game, still discovering new things. 100% worth it.",132.7
"this games preatty epic. you can win by compleating the utopia projgect, compleating the space race, being the most successful by the year 1900, or my favorite, becoming warlord and nuking everything mwahahahahah!!!!!!!!!",568.3
"if you buy this game you will lose your girlfriend, your job, and all your friends. be prepared... its just one more turn...",59.4
"can lose myself for hours in this game, well worth trying out.",177.6
"one of those games where you feel like you have been playing for an hour, but in reality its been 2 weeks and your cat died and your house burned down around you. but who really cares? you defeated bismarck and you still have sid meiers civilization v!!!!!",149.1
"got  on by khan, jokes on him though he just gave half of chinas pop hiv",24.1
"fantastic if you have a lot of time to burn. turn based strategy aglore!",69.5
"this game is worse then drugs! if you start playing it.... you cant quit!",468.3
"brilliant. i forget to eat/sleep. this may be killing me, but i dont care",420.2
"very good strategy game, most fun with a group of people. you can run and lookover how the human race has progressed through times and the troubles it has gone through. 8.5/10",24.6
"a great game for anyone that can enjoy slow paced/turn based strategy games, even if you arent that into the genre.",268.6
"so let me walk you threw this game. you start as a leader of some  and you try to nuke everyone on the map. that sums it up nice",28.1
"best city building game which evens out between fighting for your cities and fighting to take over the world.",190.0
"it is a really good game. i love to play it with friends. if i were you i would get the game. it is amazing.",150.4
"this game offers a unique experince in dealing with amassing your grand empire.",527.2
"really awesome game. you might even learn some things from it.",127.4
"if you dont already have this game, you belong in a metal institute",85.1
"its boring, historically an inaccurate mess, not immersive and slow paced as all hell. also one of the greatest damn strategy games ive played and know it to be the best ill play for long. until civ vi that is. supports a ton of playstyles and even losing a game would not bother, as its incredibly fun to just... build and develop your empire. also watch out, starting it once means all of your games will dust in your steam library for the next one to four weeks.",550.9
"a game for people like me, who have a craps load of time to create a civilization. anyway, its a lot of fun. try it out!",205.9
"great game but if you play against me....ill probably nuke you.",163.1
"one of the best strategy games ive played. immensely time consuming but great fun. 10/10",62.1
"years will go by before you realize youre still playing.",42.3
"great strategic game. good-fun, full of adventure and exploration. strategic. bad-ehh, nothing much. 10/10",99.8
"civilization v (5) review this is a really great strategy game. you choose from one of 20 different civilizations to start out with. you build your city, expand your empire, construct buildings, and choose governmental policies. certianly not a fast paced game. it may even take hours to complete. overall a great game for people that like strategy games and have alwasy dreamt of ruling the entire world. a must buy if you have the money!",9.3
"this is the best strategy game i ever played, you can link every action and reaction to real life global issues, i believe the developers spent a lot of time researching these features, i highly recommend this game and im looking for civ 6",279.3
"this is probably a good game. ill know for sure after a few months, after which i will hopefully have finished my first game",0.2
"wow is what i said after i finally beat this game this game makes you start off with nothing aand lets you create step by step and at the start peaceful times none around at the end your warriors have to fight off 2 or 3 civs just to survive and you can make freindships but in this you cant trust your allies they turn on you any chance they get annd number one rule dont trust washington the ottomans or spain",132.1
"great game. logged 30+ hours on one game. plan to go back for more",79.5
"great game for anyone who likes strategy games. varying difficulty choices allows for beginners and the challenge seeker. hundred of combinations between rulers and land masses make it almost impossible to play the same game twice. multiplayer just adds to the fun. playing with friends (or backstabbing friends) never gets old as you play your new favroite strategy game!",22.0
"highly recommended. it takes a long time to play through, but is great to have a fun time with some friends.",57.6
"simply a perfect game. buy the game, play it and be happy!",468.4
"very addictive and a different game everytime you restart.",6.5
"my nuclear powered robot was killed by rifleman. apparently it was chuck norris.",19.7
"truely amazing game, at its base it can be a little dule but with all of the expansions its a lovely game.",58.1
"this game is pretty fun. the interface takes a bit to get used to. the game is incredibly addictive though. the perpetual cycles make it hard to walk away from and therefore i ended up playing through an entire civ often, much to the detriment of my work :)",38.4
"civivilization 5 continues to improve upon this amazing franchise in small and wonderful ways. the addition of the policy trees is one of my favorite because it allows more control over the way your empire grows and gives your civ more personality than it could have in previous games. diplomacy, combat and the tech trees have all seen improvements as well as a significant upgrade in graphics quality. the two large expansions for this game, gods & kings and brave new world also add a huge amounts of complexity and depth to the game that was lacking in the former titles.",397.7
"a somewhat flawed diamond in many respects, currently lacking some of the multiplayer features one would expect from the latest in the series. the expansions help soften the blow, adding much depth to the game. plus, in regard to multiplayer, the service provided by giant multiplayer robot allows the asynchronous play sorely lacking at this time.",17.6
"this game is amazing. great strategy and fun gameplay will leave you thinking okay, just one more turn. ...and thats my biggest complaint: if you play this game, you will probably get sucked in and spend hours upon hours playing it. if youre going to buy it, make sure you have the next day or two off work.",49.3
"sick game, has me hooked for hours every time. alot of depth to how it work.",156.4
"i love it, my friend love it. and now i persuaded my girlfriend, she loves it too now! we had a lot of fun with it, good graphics and the talking portraits of the different civilizations, they are cozy and looks like a true copy of the real thing :p but im from denmark, so mister bluetooth voice is really weird and un-viking-like.",86.2
"all in all it was a fantastic game, i loved every minute.",35.1
"warning side effects of playing this game include: 1. not being able to stop 2. racism",19.3
"sid meiers civilzation v is one of the best stratagy games i have ever seen. and i am not the only one who thinks that. mulitple players and ign said the same thing. civ v is a turned based game where you try to conquer your entire map. but if that seems too hard you can either; be the first to space, have 5 diplomacies, research everything or have the most points when 2050 comes around. you play one of many famous conquers in history and try to build a civilization that will stand the test of time. if you dont want to do this alone, you dont have to! you can make helpful city-state (random civilization) become your ally and they will reward you by sending you gifts of gold, resources or even army units. if that is not what you thought i meant by not alone dont worry, you can play with other people and take down or befriend their civilzation. -fiddlesticks 9/10 review",91.2
"do i recommend this game. hell yes. this is one of the greatest games i have played and playing it with friends is even more fun. you can choose from many civilizations from the aztecs to russia and almost anyone else you can think of. so in total. yes i would reccoment this game to anyone and everyone.",169.1
"civilization has ruined, and continues to ruin, my life. would recommend.",899.4
"quickly build your empire up, make allies, declear war, reign supreme!",11.7
"dont play with danny unless youre willing to go nuclear.",116.3
"great game cause you know ... war ... its fantastic kkk",143.4
"civ 5 is a great game! cant stop playing and recommend it to anyone.",436.5
"love this game though the multiplayer can be a lil buggy at times",401.5
"great game, incorporates tremendous depth and diversity, the multiplayer is the best part and as long as you have enough time (10 hrs) youll definetely want to try it out. this is a great immersive game and fans of the previous games or strategy fans in general should definetely check it out.",233.2
"its a bit like chess. its very easy to learn what everything does and how you can use each building and unit, but doing anything actually meaningful with all those things over the course of an entire match will take you a lot of practice and learning. a single match can easily last around 10 hours, and alliances youve made (or broken) in the beginning of a game can have surprising effects on the end-game, although the ai sometimes makes this work a bit weird.",95.4
"i love this game. if you are into history and always ask yourself the question *what if?* this game gives you the perfect answer. you remake history with whatever civilization you choose. i have spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game and do not regret any of it. some people may not have a lot of fun with the game because of the setup given, for example: polynesians who have advantages at exploring the sea spawning in the middle of a huge countinent. they have to form their empire to make sure they are successful in the end and come out on top. making a religion and being rich might be your key to success in some games, while it may hinder it in others.",1071.6
"its a relay relay cool game i play it a lot only u do need a strong computer but still i recommend u",147.3
"a complex update to the civ series. a.i. is still cold and unforgiving at times. i found the game to be more combat centric in the early game than the previous versions of civ.",4.1
"fantastic game. easy to learn and pick up on. one of the best games on steam.",41.7
"siv v.. a very good game indeed but needing some improvents including some new characters like stalin and hitler.. because when i get home after a hard day of work i like to recreate the genocides that happened in the 1930-40s.. it brings a tear to my heart of happiness when i see it being done. this game is great for almost everyone that likes to think (1% of the u.s population). 1 final problem with the game is that when you are allys with a city-state or ruler, not once can you ask friendly troops if they want to have sex with other troops, very prejudice against homosexuals i see. anyway, would recommend to most folks. 69/69",42.3
"ive played this series from civ2 onwards and i continue to be amazed with the depth of gameplay. be warned that this is is one of those, ... just one more turn. games and will keep you up late at night.",487.5
"this game could be one of the the reasons crime rates have gone down while obesity rates go up.",388.0
"this is addictive fun, get it. especially during exams.",61.7
"as a mind games lover i highly reccomend this game even if you one of the people who dont love looking up for many tutorials and guides to play a game. this game briliant once you play it you cant get enought as some one who made more then 10 saves atleast and still every new game is more crazy then the other just the felling from making your first city with one population all the way to a huge empire with an advanced army. i highly reccomend this game to everyone no metter what types of game you love action,adventure or any other type this game is fun for everyone.",224.5
"this game never ends and is very addicting first game set it to random lasted 15hrs totaly worth the buy but id say till it goes on sale so you can buy all the dlc and the game cheaply",33.6
"when i first played civ v vanilla, i counldnt get into but once i decided to invest into the two expansions (g+k & bnw) im really enjoying it and having an awesome time with it. i would definetly recommened getting this along with its expansion to make the experience of playing this more enjoyable and exciting. this will go down as one of my fav civ and strategy games of all time.",127.0
"dont play with friends, theyll stab you in the back as soon as you start winning.",251.3
"anyone who is any kind of strategy player this is a must have. with the seemingly limitless mods and ways to play you cant go wrong. very easy to sink hundereds of hours into this game without even realizing it. this game is a must have for everyone.",227.0
"hours and hours of fun, totally addictive, love it.",108.0
"i found civ5 much like i did the others in the series: once i got the expansion packs, the experience became so much better. this game is nothing short of addictive.",244.5
"best game ever. until you cry when the ais or your mates started to war on you, for resources or land.",233.8
"this is an absolutely magnaflorious game, nuff said, buy it",88.2
"great game, very replayable. definitely worth it, and its on sale, so if youre thinking of buying it, dont think twice and get it!",129.7
"its an amazing game with a large modding community. if you havent got this game, you should get it when onsale.",69.2
"fantastic, strategic gameplay. an immersive learning curve gets you into the game early, and you cant help but play until youre the last nation standing.",618.0
"i love playing this game, i would highly recomend it to anyone who has alot of time, its very addaicting!",295.9
"game is a lot better now bugs are sorted and dlc released",63.4
"this game is verry fun and addicting. a surprising feature i found on it was the ability of hotseat play, which allows more than one person to play this game on the same computer!",98.6
"easy to learn difficult to master as some people say. i love this game more and more with every passing hour of play. dlc adds tons of new units which is ok, but also adds spies, religions and lot more complex elements i wish i could turn off. also, ai is , convince friends as soon as possible",78.9
"the cheapest way to quickly travel forward in time.",292.0
"this is the single greatest turn-based strategy i have ever played. the battles are fun and paced well, the economic system is well crafted, the diplomatic sysem is interested and keeps you on your toes as you try and figure out what each opposing ruler is planning, and the city building is quite unique. if you like strategy games or justwant a low-stress, relaxing, and fun game to play, then buy sidmeiers civ v. you wont regret it.",286.6
"i love this one over all the rest, you cannot just stack your troops into an unstoppable one tile wide army, you have to use strategy. that being the main difference in the game, the rest is all civilization, boot it up and kiss the next 24 hours goodbye as you time travel.",186.3
"this game is ridiculously addicting. would definitely recommend as it is a great strategy game.",179.5
"spectacularly good game. definately one to pick up with friends and play when you get bored of repetetive fps. i would recomend also getting the brave new world dlc aswell.",324.5
"though ive never really enjoyed strategy games, sid meiers civilization v has definately been an enjoyable game to play. though things arent always historically correct *cough cough* (america in the ancient era), its still fun trying to outlast the ai or the barbarians. overall, this is one of the best games ive played so far. if you have the money, get it.",29.1
"really this is a yes and no recomendation i like the new map setup and no unit stacking but its too simplified and sure dlcs fix that but that is $60 usd for both",56.9
"takes about 48 hours to understand about an eigth of it, but wow, rewarding as ever. extremely good game.",12.7
"the first time i tried civ 5, i wasnt much of a fan of the strategy genre of games. that was until i play civ 5. it just simply has profoundly amazing gameplay, stunning graphics, and the replayability is great for trying out different styles of playing the game. it has exceeded my expectations, and i highly reccomend it.",40.9
"very good game, a shame there are almost no nordic/germanic civs in standard. got gold now!",170.9
"a great game. i played it for a lot of hours. the dlc of bnw brought a lot of new options to play the game. sometimes the difficulty of the ais doesnt really resemble the difficulty you choose. and of course the multiplayer is awesome :d",308.9
"very amazing game, though falls a bit short against civ 4",71.5
"i say, playing as oda nobunaga and getting george cromwell born in the land of the rising sun really made me smile. and gandhi nuked osaka twice.",2.3
"this is worse than crack , 11/10 , would buy again !",267.3
"if you buy a game purely from how much hours you get from it, this game should be worth 100+. its  how much time i spent the first week i got this game. i spent the whole first week playing this game. wake up, play, eat, sleep. wake up, play, eat, sleep. for a week. for one game of civ. just buy it if you want to lose the rest of your days. it is now belong to sid meier.",66.6
"a must have for anyone who likes turn based strategy games. the game itself is fun and simple. its a bit overwhelming at first, but when you get down to it and play a couple of turns, do a bit of reading on the units and structures, itll all make sense. it is, however, a lengthy game. it could take hours or days to finish a single game. this is practically this games only major flaw.",114.4
"addicting. ... like its predecessors... a game to spend the whole day saying , just one more turn ...how i missed my civ marathons ^^ !",187.8
"great strategic game, makes you want to play more and more.",65.1
"awesome game. endless replayability. cant wait for the next one!",242.1
"only a person named stevoqueer would enjoy such a game of this magnitude",4.1
"you can buy a hard copy for like half the ing price",160.2
"this game is a must play, its one of the only games i have a lot of hours on!",121.5
"this game is a serious load of fun; however, a single match can take ages. in the words of a good friend of mine, it would probably take less time to build an actual civilization than to finish one game here.",29.9
"endless replay potential hence the ~1000 hours logged... :/",1067.0
"make sure you do not buy the original game on its own. buy the game bundle with all the dlc. far more worth it and you save a lot of money in doing so. buy the original game and the dlc separately is a major rip off.",85.2
"there are not words for how much time i have spent on this game. it is amazingly addictive. suggestion: find someone to marry who also plays civ. its the only way.",690.7
"i lost friends over this game 11/10 best $30 ive ever spent",295.7
"so. addicting. raising a nation and choosing how you will take over the world is such a detailed process that you can take hundreds of different routes to achieve it in this game. the amount of choices and control you have over every aspect of the game is incredible. would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy. 8.5/10",24.2
"cant really go wrong with old sids games can you?",695.6
"very good game, but games usually take several days to win.",213.5
"sid meiers civilization v is a slightly complex turn based strategy game that can be enjoyed by all gamers. a fun and interactive map allows players to manipulate their surroundings in order to achieve their goal. teaming up with friends in order to dominate enemy civilizations is a remarkably enjoyable experience.",39.9
"just one more turn... completely losing track of time is a pretty strong indication of whether a game is good in my book, and civilization 5 may be the best by that metric. as a newbie to the civ series, managing a society through the ages had sounded a bit daunting, but thankfully the game is very intuitive for series beginners. the visuals, narration, and music are all pitch-perfect, evoking a grand ambience fit for a game about world conquest. individual games can take hours, but it never feels tedious or repetitive. computer opponents seem to have plenty of personality, and multiplayer with friends is a blast. i realize turn-based strategy games may not be for everyone, but it would be difficult for me to find someone i wouldnt recommend this game to.",63.8
"damn, frikin shtty city-states are all like: oh! you better give us money or well end this friendship! dude, wtf you started the friendship jeeze but good game, just kill city-states as soon as you see them",34.7
"what can i say about the best turn based strategy series? multi-touch support rocks, hex tiles are great. its as great as previous versions, offering huge civiliopedia to teach you actual history, stealing your precious life with never ending one more turns. your average strategy game ends in 1 hour, while civilization might not end in months. not everyone can play this game, can you build an empire to stand the test of time?",266.7
"this is a really fun game, i have had no problems with it :)",16.5
"was julius ceaser, made archers, ghandi declared war on me and i was killed by queen elizabeth. 10/10.",11.1
"love it goes threw history great sound affects, music, and art",253.3
"a great game that combines strategy, warmongering and building! the ai needs a huge improvement though... i got washington down to his last city and he demanded that i give him all my money and luxury resources for peace!?",42.7
"probably the greatest turn based strategy game ive played to date. with all the different victory conditions, map layouts, and leaders, its like playing a different game each time. the games do take a long time though, especially playing with others, be prepared to sit down for 6 hours and play. or you can do pitboss games and the game also alows you to safe it and pick it up later.",137.4
"another great game. though i stopped bying the addons. samey samey..",27.7
"good game, lots of replay value, and lots of mods in the workshop.",194.7
"i would greatly reccomend this game for anyone who likes strategy games. this has already given me hours of fun, with many more to come, im certain. the multiplayer featre is epic, allowing you to save and resume a game at any time later, which is very useful for me. the ai is very good, it is reasonable as far as i can see. i have not played the other civilization games, so i am not comparing this game to others like it, but i would definitely reccomend this game for you to purchase. it is well worth your money.",166.2
"civ 5 is a great game if you have tons of time to pour in or very little, one of the few games i love recomending.",270.6
"this is a great game you can spend hours playing either casually or competitively. this is the best turn based strategy game i have ever played and would recommend it to everyone even if the genre is not one you would normally play.",466.9
"if you are prone to addictions, do not buy this game. 10/10 would get addicted again.",18.2
"when i lost contact with my friends the ai in this game did suffice. overall a really fun game, can be a bit enraging if youre not prepared for a situation. 10/10",34.0
"this game has taken a lot of my time; probably not even close to as much as other people who play this. it is a very accessable game but also can be complexed. i recommend getting the expansions as the final expansion adds more importance to faith and culture. this game can be addictive though. i played 3 playthroughs; by the end of the 3rd night, i had 20+ hours into it.",44.8
"this game is fantastic...there is so much depth and content.",225.0

"great game, best empire building sim ive played in a long time, and the dlc adds an amazing amount depth to the game making all those boring turns where you had to wait more interesting by giving you spies to control, a religion to build, famous works of art to create and collect and dozens of new buildings, multiple changes to cultural unlocks and culture trees a complete re-work of the culture system, and several new units that fill gaps that never should have existed.

"this game overall is very addicting and a fun game and i 100% recommend it. the only thing i find dumb about it is the fact that if your civilizations borders are too close to another civilization they will eventually attack you no matter what. other than that the game is pretty amazing.",40.8
"the god king of 4x games. this takes everything great from civ 2, 3, and 4 and puts them together fix nearly every complaint ive had about the series. it has the elegance of 2, with improved graphics, streamlined strategies, more intelligent ai and maps, and a multiplayer thats engrossed me for hundreds of hours so far. if strategy is your thing, this game is required.",520.7

"just one more turn... completely losing track of time is a pretty strong indication of whether a game is good in my book, and civilization 5 may be the best by that metric. as a newbie to the civ series, managing a society through the ages had sounded a bit daunting, but thankfully the game is very intuitive for series beginners. the visuals, narration, and music are all pitch-perfect, evoking a grand ambience fit for a game about world conquest. individual games can take hours, but it never feels tedious or repetitive. computer opponents seem to have plenty of personality, and multiplayer with friends is a blast. i realize turn-based strategy games may not be for everyone, but it would be difficult for me to find someone i wouldnt recommend this game to.",63.8

"this game is great. ive never played the previous civ games, so this game was quite intimidating. there is so much data presented, it is hard to figure out which is important and which isnt. it will take you some time to learn how to have fun with this game, as the pacing seems glacially slow when you dont know what you are doing. by the time youve beaten a few games, youll be having a great time playing. i love playing each new scenario and learning mechanics i didnt understand before. it makes me excited to play the next game to try out a new strategy! touch support on this game is really great too.",78.5

"civilization v is a beautiful game, capturing the struggles of a leader trying to create a dominant empire to rise above the others. somehow, it manages to be both simple and complex. it is mostly realistic and offers some humorous irony and increased difficulty in the form of ghandi. however, its dlc are way overpriced for the amount of content they actually offer and it gets boring after the first few playthroughs. overall, it is an amazing game that will keep you invested for hours on end, keeping you on your toes until the last turn.

"very complex and time consuming game that is quite in depth in many ways... took alot for a first timer like myself to learn the ropes, but once i did this game become a lot more fun. i would only recommend this game to rpg/strategy ethusiasts as i still find it to be quite a hard game even on the easier difficulty settings. this game is also what is called a turn based game, which at first i found a bit boring. once i adapted to the games style though, the whole turn based system becomes very relevant and added another level of strategy to it all. overall, the game is well thought out and very in depth making it simply put epic.",55.0

"civilization v is a great game. it vaguley reminds me of a tycoon, but yet so much more! the standalone game is great, but if you get the dlc, you will be supprised how much better it is. overall, i give civ a 4/5. great job, devs!",56.2
"it is very fun game to play. and on higher difficulties a challenge to win the game.",211.2

"a great game for anyone that wants to burn a few hours. its a game of wits and brute strength, forging allies and waging war all to gain a foothold over your rivals. many or few, every game is different with a huge selection of map types and playable factions. i have played multiple runs of this game and still it is my favorite civ from sid so far. im sure ill have many more hours in this game as the acheivment list is 200+. multiplayer has a little to be desired as the matching can sometime take awhile and games tend to get overpowered one way or another rather early on. finding solid players that can last a match is uncommon. with all being said the game is definetly playing.",379.3
"my favorite games are simulation and open world, and this game is both. online matches get very competitive, and can last for many hours. the fact that you can build your civilization anywhere you want and as long as you want makes this a game i will always come back too.",7.0

"probably the best strategy game ive ever played and i am now going to be a long time fan of the series",664.3
"base game is solid. the expansion turns it into a brilliant and balanced game. only issue i have with it, is that it is so good that it makes you want to play it with friends. and the multiplayer is the most unstable thing i ever experienced in a game. and you play it anyway, cursing sid meier every step of the way. because it is good enough to make you wade through the suffering of constant disconnects.",512.1

"if you can get your hands on this game with all expansions, by all means do it.",153.0

"the fifth instalment in sid meiers civilization series brings a new fresh flavour to the game. the overal expirience is a lot smoother and simplified when compared to civ iv. id definitely recommend this game to beginers in strategy games but to seasoned aficianados as well.",50.3
"civilization v is in all honesty, the best game i have ever had the pleasure of playing. its not just how much time the developers have put into making this game as good as possible, its also how much the community has helped the game thrive and become more of a player friendly experience. although if you want to buy it, i strongly recommend getting bnw and gk (brave new world and gods and kings) as they improve the game mechanics greatly. the community as a whole makes this game worth while, mods improve the game greatly even in places where you thought there could be no improvement. 11/10 strongly recommend it.",299.0

"okay, ive got to be at college at 9am tomorrow, ill just have a quick game on civ before i go to bed. 2 hours later damn it ghandi! you will perish! 5 hours later ah , 3 hours sleep it is true story. happend to me the day i wrote this review.",53.4

"ive been a fan of the civilization series since civ iii, and im always eagerly anticipating the release of the next update/expansion pack or version. the hexagon in civ v and the dropping of stacking took some getting used to, but it definitely revitalized the series. the reworking of the culture victory has been a bit of a letdown though, but then again, i never attempt cultural victories. overall, great game and worth every penny.",622.2

"if you have no social life and hate the sun and dont want to move for days on end get this game",226.2
"civilization v is in my opinion the best 2k game published, not only is it a amazing strategy game it incorporates so many aspects which are lost in so many other games. i have to date played 789 hours on this game and whilst i have not played in a while that is purely due to scaling down my gaming time. i cannot recommend this enough, i mean who doesnt want to nuke some random civ whilst they are in medieval era and your in future era?? its fantastic in every way. pros: ai is awesome (few if any glitches) steam workshop wide variety of civilizations many different maps not focused solely on combat and everything else about the game except: you arent playing it right now like you should be! 10/10",789.4

"omg yes strategy fan? you will love this game. ok, its a different take than the fast paced age of empires or the bazing fast starcraft, but even though the combat is not challenging, you do need to think your movements through before executing, or youll find yourself in a pesky situation. its fun that its history-oriented, but its kinda irrelevant in my opinion. you just have to know what kind of buffs you get from each civ and pick your victory route. the ai tends to not be quite friendly but that keeps things interesting if you cant find people to play with (and lets face it, the games are loooong, so its rather hard to coordinate with other humans :p). great game!",44.2
"it is possible that you disliked vainilla civ5. but trust me on this, after 2 expansions the game has become a truly masterpiece.",440.6
"excellent game! i have played the civ series from from the the dos era to today...a must for any strategy player",715.6
"do you have hours you really need to get rid of? civilization v best time killer 4000 bc - 2050 ad (more addictive than popcorn)",89.9
"an excellent turn-based rts that can be picked up very easily by those not so familiar with the genre or experienced players. as stated in many other reviews, youll find yourself playing this game for tens of hours without even realizing it, its that addicting!",182.9
"about to reach 400 hours in this game. i guess you could say its okay.",572.1
"ive played civilization 3 for years, then about a year ago i got more into games and i got steam. a few months later i got this game, i love the community, the dlcs, and i love the game. civilization has been an amazing game series. i cant wait to see more games like this come out. so check this game out and have fun. (10/10)",38.7
"sid meiers once again astonishes me. this game is more than genius. 10/10",23.0
"really good product, ever since i first tried kfc i couldnt get enough of it. thanks to kfc i will never be hungry again. 9/10 (could have better nuggets).",49.4
"sid mieirs civilizaton v is one of the best strategies, but you should buy gods & kings dlc ( i think that brave new world is too difficult for newbie )",135.0
"great game, lots of content and huge replayablitiy. some minor problems, not anything to worry about.",86.0
"not only one of the best 4x or strategy games ive played, but it tops the charts as one of the most enjoyable times ive had playing a video game. the multiplayer can get a little glitchy sometimes, but is worth it nonetheless. ive gotten in some heated political arguments with my friends while immersed in civ 5, which were some of the most unique experiences ive had on a pc game. the single player ai is also very unique, as each country has their own personalities. all around a great game.",108.4
"this game is awesome, maybe is cuz im sid meiers follower, but im also sure that if u like the strategy by turns u love this game too",50.2
"one of the best time wasters of all time. dont play if you dont have a lot of time in your hands. this will get you hooked.",46.5
"the game that keeps on giving. civilization has come a long way from the first release in 1991 (which i still occasionally play) to the 5th edition (plus addons). the idea of building your own empire throughout history is still captivating. one of the best features of the game is that the player can decide on what victory conditions to pick: discovery, culture, ... and yes, military style as well. although in my eyes secondary for a good game, the graphics add to my overall opinion of two thumbs up. the only item i definitely miss is a thick manual to read (like in the good old days) while the game is downloading and installing. ps: dont trust ghandi. :-)",451.3
"very fun game but it lags alot and often and will crash a bit",69.9
"love the versatility and unique play styles of each leader and love the ability to play with my friends online and the drop in drop out is wonderful",116.4
"i strongly recommend this game for avid strategists. your objective is to nurture a civilisation and become victorious over all others. there are numerous victory possibilities thanks to a large range of ingame concepts from tourism to science. each civilisation has its unique units/buildings as well as an ability through their leader. moreover, the dedicated mod workshop enhances the game further still, bestowing upon it astronomical replay value. give it a try, you wont regret it !",232.5

"basically my favorite game ever. at the moment ive clocked 277 hours, i intend to get waaaaaay more.",735.5

"this review is for those who are completely new to civilizations. the sun rises. you emerge from your cave with a new mindset, a goal to achieve, something no one has ever experienced before. expansion. you build a new home to you and others when the time comes. and yet this hunger still remains. you explore the vast surroundings and find many new resources, unkown to you. you experiement and realise, this clay can be used for pottery! fast forward 300 years, your once small town has now expanded into 3 cities, all of which are feared and respected by the surrounding neighbors. yet they require more. shall you attack and conquer the weak? or befriend and parter up with the strong? these are the choices you make in civilizations. choose wisely.",85.6
"hours and hours of replay value; best strategy game on the market and cant be beat 11/10 would buy on itunes",23.7

"great game, and one of the few games that has survived the test of time! great stratigic game, and a lot of different ways to play it do to many different victories and the different civilizations which each grant their own special bonus. 10/10 ;) if you are planing on buying this you could also buy brave new world :)",233.3
"holy hell this game is fun as heck! i freaking love it so far, even though i barely played an hour. 10/10 so far.",94.3
"one of the best games ever created! hours of fun, infinite replay value, and even more fun with friends! not only does this game provide hours of fun, but it can also provide a challenge to even the most advanced gamer. my advice to anyone who doesnt have this game, buy it!",307.8
"this game is the reason i have no friends, no money and no home. 11/10 would get nuked by gandhi again.",414.2
"brilliant strategy game although by itself can feel empty after a while and g&k + bnw can fix this and everybody who feels like getting the best possible experience of this game should buy those main two expansion packs for the game. for anybody looking to get into the strategy genre, this can also be a good place to start. 8/10",65.5
"this game gave me nightmares of being gangbanged by genghis khan attila the hun and shaka of the zulus 10/10",466.8
"verry good game! i bought it in the steam summer sales as the complete pack. played it for hours!!!",121.6
"this game is one of the best, single player is fun due to the many diffrent ways to win as well as the diffrent leaders own abilitys which makes you change strategy. also there are many map types and can make is more challeging with the manyh difficulties. varity of mods you can add and multiplayer with your friends is always a laugh.",356.5
"ia have some problems, but, its civ, its cool, is amazing, maybe the best strategy game ever made. so, buy the game, make they profit so they can make the civ 6",105.7
"10/10 one of the bests strategy games out there and the dlcs are great too you must play it",315.8
"a very nice strategy game, very simple yet so complex. its a very fun game, and you can learn a thing or 2 about history from it, which is a bonus (i guess), and even though its not civ 4, its actually pretty fun.",77.6
"this game provides a very different form of entertainment than most other simulator games. sid meier has captured the perfect combination of war, science, culture, and economy. you can win by taking over the world, reaching alpha centauri, sending a space shuttle into space via the apollo program, or by building the united nations. the only word that i can possibly sum this game up with would be wow.",93.9
"i strongly recomend getting this game, gandhi needs more haters",89.9
"its a really fun game where you can decimate your enemies or take the one of many peaceful ways out. you can also make wonders and buildings and found a religion. all in all i give it a 10/10.",53.0

"only in this game can you have the great wall of china, the pyramids, and the hanging gardens all in russia",40.3
"i love this game and have dedicated almost 600hrs to it....yeah i know thats kind of sad. the only thing i would have liked to of seen is in civ 4. you started out in the location on an earth map where your civ was historically located. and played through time to see if you could make your civ survive history. thought that would have been nice too",681.8
"a wonderful turn-based strategy game. fun to play with your friends especially. i recommend that everyone give this a try, and those who do like it should purchase the complete edition. 10/10",8.8
"would gift gandhi giant death robots for world domination again 11/10 please, just dont nuke me gandhi.",93.2
"at first i was wary - how could you beat civ 4? now i am conviced it is fantastic. it is also worth picking up gods and kings with it.",103.3
"this game is one of my favourite games ever, it is really fun to play with friends and solo, if you want a game you can play for a few hours or even an hour, this game is for you, civ 5 described in one word, #fantabulous",109.8

"this game is great for people who are looking for a long strategy game to play. very indept and very enjoyable.",120.2
"surprisingly addictive game, extremely diluted grand strategy fit for newcomers to the genre/idiots. if you play games like crusader kings avoid, but if your coming from games like call of duty or starcraft this might be for you. wait nvm ghandi just nuked my capital brb",32.5
"an realy awsome game... i liked it... and it actually teach me some stuff... you can learn stuff from the game and i had a great time playing with it",230.2
"if you are going to play this be sure to have alot of hours , yes literally some days it takes forever but when you have world domination nothing beats that felling. myself really enjoys spending countless hours on this game just because you get to conquer all in any way you want.",83.6

"best fricken game ever, spending far too much of my days playing this right now, but too caught up in building my civ! ^-^",308.0
"civilization v is a very great game, especially with the brave new world dlc. politics is dynamic and ui is very user friendly. combat is very simple, which might or might not appeal to some people. recommended!",53.2
"i bought this game and was very satisfied with it as i had 22hours played within only two days. however i was later so mad that i nearly obliterated my computer as this fuc**** game shuts down whenever im about 1 hour in to a game in multiplayer, civilization v has stopped responding oh and if it was just that easy to task manager abort it, i wouldnt write this review, because, no it wont allow itself to be shut down, no no, it rather bug my task manager again. anyhow, let off from multiplayer this game is fantastic! 8/10 would play again!",174.7
"for the truelly fearless and hardcore strategy gamer see how u stand up to a legit turn-based campaign and be proven how much of a  u really are!!!!!",175.1
"amazing, im totally addicted... the dlc is heaven, its a recommended for new and old civ players :p",465.7
"an excellent update to the classic series. the gameplay is streamlined but not simplified, and the hex-based map makes exploration easier and less time-consuming. the ai is a bit lacking, but civ has always worked best in multiplayer. it also feels like this game lacks some of the character that civ iv had. the soundtrack isnt as good and its missing those classic leonard nimoy tech intros. all in all, a great game, but id stick to iv for single player.",129.2
"most historically correct  ive ever played. 10/10 would get nuked by ghandi again.",605.4

"a great game and fun to play in single and multiplayer",485.2
"might precipitate dvt, which later may lead to sudden pulmonary embolism and death. that one more turn might after all not worth it, so dont forget to take a 5 minute break every 1 or 2 hours. cheers.",123.1
"its fun fun fun and more fun. you will play the whole day and you will still want more siv.",214.7
"sarcasm warning do you hate your friends? do you want to hate your friends, then buy civ v the greatest hate fuel of all. watch as you and your friends scramble to build the best cultural buildings in all of history only to be beaten out by the ai players. enjoy the rage between all of you as you try to move through borders and pledge war on eachother. witness the expanding nations slowly taking over the map as you are raided by raging barbarians. tl:dr 10/10 would ruin friendships",74.4
"an overall fun game with tons of replay value that is detrimented by the sheer amount of dlc. if you didnt buy all the dlc from the get-go, enjoy forking out a bunch of cash to be able to enjoy the full game, or have fun in singleplayer since almost all multiplayer matches require dlc. edit: i managed to get two of the expansion packs and it makes the game more deep and enjoyable, but i still think those who are suckered into buying any other version that the complete edition are going to be disappointed at the money they have to spend to fully enjoy the game. still a great game.",277.8
"love it. on thing though, if ghandi invents nuclear elephants runnn",63.3
"this game is addictive. really shallow without g&kings and goty edition, but with those two dlcs its incredibly complex, educational (i know!) and all in all, fun. get it on sale as its a popular sale title. prepare to lose hours without even realizing it.",16.4
"fantastic game. expansions add moreplay through possibilities.",420.6
"oh gandhi congratulations on building the manhattan project i wonder wh-",68.2
"i have never played any games in this series but honestly, i think this is my favorite strategy games. you take contol of you own civilization and choose if you want to be a militaristic empire or if you want to become allies with all the city states you find. i recommend this game to everyone. ive been hooked ever since i started playing.",46.8

"civilization v (complete) is easily one of the best tbs 4x games ever made.",422.4
"a nice game for heavy-weighters and black people!!",41.6
"sid meiers latest entry in the award winning civilization series is fantastic. it allows you to rule a country however you would like, be it peacefully allying yourself with others or steamrolling them with the feet of your armies. the two expansions, although steeply priced, is a must for the full experience and i reccomend the dlc strongly. if you love 4x games and have a lot of money in gifted steam cards, than i highly reccomend considering civilization v. however, if you couldnt put a lot of time into one saved game (a standard game could be awhile,) then you might want to look at less time intensive titles. 10/10",791.3
"buy this game and it will eat your brains. 0/10 needs shrek civ",52.2
"its a great game full of adventures and upgrades. you can research really excisting projects and monuments. it looks a bit like age of empires ii, but i think this game is more fun (and more expensive).",551.0
"game constantly crashes, i rarely go 10 turns without having to restart the whole game; this is with running off 8 gb of ram with an intel core i5 processor. very frustrating! on the rate occasion the game works it is a great game and highly addictive!",294.6
"this is a good game but sooo much dlc.... they want all our money",977.1

"great game you can come back to time and time and time again",621.3
"this is my go to game for burning a morning away. with so many variables in how you play and how ai/other players can play, the game has so much replayability. the graphics are well done and the music is beautiful. gameplay is easy to pick up. there really is no right or wrong way to play, only ways that work for you or dont. so many different ways you could take this. warfare, diplomacy, keep to yourself and pray, etc. a great game in a long line of amazing games in the series.",215.8
"since everyone else is placing their reviews, and having around 30-50 hours of gametime, i figured id put my word in and close the time gap. this game is amazing, you will not regret getting it. its not a waste of time, nor is it a waste of money. this game will have you playing it over and over repeatedly. replay value? definately a lot. in fact, if you were to buy this game right now, and youve liked the gameplay videos and screenshots, im positive youd like to play the game for yourself. go ahead and buy it if its your cup of tea! its very fun, and youll enjoy yourself. :)",811.8
"yes. game addicting and fun. frusterating sometimes but good. i like being washington.",39.1
"do you have lots of friends that love eachother! well this game is perfect for you! it has a few side effects though... 1. watch your friendships crumble to pieces in a matter of minutes! 2.discover that paranoid side of you that you never thought you had. 3. greed (that is all) so enjoy hating your friends! if you dont have friends well...try single player and get nuked by ghandi! have fun!",93.0
"civilization v is really addicting! when you buy the complete edition, you save a ton of money if you want the dlc... i logged 32 hours and i just bought it this week... in my opinion, it is great, no second thoughts on this game...",62.7

"love this game and the xpacs. im pushing 1000 played hours and still find ways to have fun with this game!",1033.2
"the game is really good. i have spent about a good bit of time playing. its not a total waste of money. the game feels more like a simulator than strategy. all the cpus can have different personalitys and actually have a think more. even on easy the cpus are making good descisions. the game also lets you choose a historical figure such as alexander the great, washington, ramses, elizabeth, and augustus caesar. multiplaye is pretty good to. with a special chat syste, you not really need any voice speaking. all the mechanics make the game intresting and fun. i would say sid did a good job on this game. my rating is 9/10 (this game is one of the best i have seen)",147.7
"i originally got this for me and a friend to play together a few years back and to be totally honest the game is amazing. i would of course at least reccomend playing the demo to see if youre into this kind of thing but civilization v is a very fun game and its great to play with your friends!",210.7
"very addictive game.. just.. one.. more.. turn.. :)",52.9
"theres no such thing as a quick game in civilization v. and the thought of just one more turn, then ill... will creep up and gobble up your time. its immersive, looks good and theres so many options that youll be a bit overwhelmed if youve never played a civ before. playing the board game isnt a really good reference, i might add. luckily, i had help with learning the game and once you have, its just great fun. keep a clock nearby, though. it wont be long before you think its just past 11 and it really is 2 am.",74.6
"ive been playing sid meiers civilization games since the first one came out in the early 1990s. the series has given me hours of entertainment and more than a few nights of missed sleep. civilization v was a bit shaky at launch, but the developers seem to have worked out the bugs, and it is now an excellent game.",143.9
"great game! it seems like it would be really boring at first, but i ended up playing this for 5 hours straight the night i bought it. as you play, you learn more about the inner mechanics of the game and you start molding your personal strategy for success.",190.9

"hands down the best strategy game you will play. given the complexity of the game, the learning curve is steep, but not that steep. ive invested 200+ hours into the game and am still learning new things. many improves in v make this game not only more approachable, but tactically different than its predecessors. various victory conditions and civilizations to play make this game such an amazing feat by firaxis games. a must buy!",314.6
"never played a civ game before i played this one and it is a lot of fun. even without the dlc i played about 40 hours and with the expansions it is even more addicting. i bought it when it was on sale, but its definitely worth full price.",228.0
"civilization series were always the most addicting, difficult and rewarding games ever. civilization 5, alone or with gods and kings & brave new world is the most time consuming devil that posses your time and will never give it back. although your only way to resist is to click next turn and bring glory to your civilization. most complex game with many victory types, strategies, difficulty levels (from easiest for even strategy noobies to most experienced generales who were raised with rts by their sides), units, resources, everything... this game has everything that us - nerds love. and you can read a book in one time while playing on huge map around atomic era :d",175.3
"amazing game that forces you to balance between being nice with others and destroying your enemies to expand your empire.",425.6
"awesome game with the dlc but the standard version is missing a lot of stuff from older civs. buy in bundle if price is reduced, but not only main game.",120.1

"really enjoyable game, extremely easy to sink hours and hours into it thanks to its good replay value.",296.1
"solid strategy game, but make sure you have time on your hands if you want to jump into this game. although it is quite time consuming, the size of this game is just unbelievable. a whole variety of civilizations, maps, victory types and military units cause you to mix different strategies to best conform with the current world, which is pretty swell.",201.2
"great game with lots of hours of gameplay multiplayer and singleplayer. well done 2k games for a great strategy. if you want a pack i would recommend getting complete edition as it comes with most dlcs and is worth the money. great game, great game. looking forward to the future of the game!! :)",138.9

"what can i say about this game? if youve ever played previous iterations of this game (i started with civilization ii), then youre probably already addicted and own it. for newcomers, i think firaxis have done an amazing job simplifying the ui and providing useful prompts for new mechanics as they appear, so this is a great version to start with. even with the simplifications, all the depth youd expect from this game is still there and you can expose it easily (the city management screen for example). with the gods & kings and brave new world dlc, firaxis have made what i think is by far the most entertaining civilization yet! so, to summarise: buy this game if you have any love for strategy and a w streak. just be prepared to lose entire days to it.",496.8
"this is a game you can easily lose a day too. 4x games always look incredibly boring too watch but once you start playing one you just cant stop. gods and kings and brave new world are pretty much required too get as the base game was a little too basic. the five different victroy types make finding new strategys all the more fun.",194.8
"i whole heartedly love this game the first day i got it i spent the whole day with my friend playing it. stayed up till 6 a.m. this game is one of my top 10 its easy to pick up and play .the games are long but you can change settings to make it shorter this games makes me feel like the creator had the consumer in mind while creating this game 9/10",169.3

"easily one of the best games ive ever played. i played this game on single player for days without getting bored and could play it almost endlessly with friends on multiplayer.",291.3
"its an exhausting game to play, but once you have the bnw expansion, its also one of the best strategy games youll get your hands on. **edit:** i have now played the game long enough to know what all my quirks with the game is. i still believe its a really good game. for a future civ game, id love to see a pitboss mode that allows you to use a shared steamcloud save, and gave steam notifications when it is your turn, rather than having a dedicated server running hosting the game 24/7 while it is played (which could be months potentially). a pitboss mode like this would be even more attractive if a future civ game was focused more around optimization and lightweight-ness than pretty polygons. the perfect civ would be an epic game spanding several months, where itd take you 20 seconds to sign in, take a turn, and leave the game again.",280.8
"the temptation that is a steam sale is too much for one with a will as weak as mine. at first you remember the strategy games you used to play, cnc, starcraft, lotr b4me. you then run the game to get serenaded by its wonderfully, eloquent intro. you then play the tutorial, as this game is more in depth than justin biebers social life. never did i think this game would suck up so many hours of my time. a tutorial, which took me a good 12 hours as i went and read what things do, and think of what i should do depending on the situation. you will learn to hate barbarians, you will learn to hate them, and then you will destroy them. the satisfaction of getting the barbarians away from your capital, and saving your first workers is just too much. if you play this game you will forget what day of the week it is, and realize that you got fired from your job for playing civ 5 for 3 days.",48.0

"a long playing stratergy game in which you can lead your civilization to victory or be crushed by more powerful and vicious leaders along the way. learn how best to use your civ and keep your people from revolt. this is not a game to knock over in a lunch break, but one to languish on over a couple of days. great fun to play with some friends.",298.5
"one of my favourite games. it is so expansive and so wonderfully done, a treat to any fans of the series or turn-based strategy games in general. i love changing the tables of time and making the roman empire last forever as still the powerful people or making the native indian be the ones who attack america and make them loose their homeland. it is also a game where you cant help but spend an entire game on because you want to get that one goal or ahievement hunt (which takes many many hours of playing to time to find because of how diverse the game is). i would recomend this to anyone.",681.7

"this game!!!!! im not usually the type to enjoy a game like this, im more into arma and the such, but picking this up in the sale was a genious idea! everything looks so crisp and clean, a little hard to get used to at first, but thanks to the tutorial after a game or two youll pick up everything you need to know. this game is made even better if you have friends to play it with too as thanks to the steam cloud saving you can load up your saved game with your friend anytime, and stop playing whenever you like.",56.1
"this game is pure crack. there is nothing more addictive than this game. i want to gift this game only to my worst enemies and all the evil mad humans out there. get somebody in touch with kim jong-un, set him up a steam-account and get him this game: it kills lifetime without being able to be productive in any form(except playing this game). the world will be a better and peacefull place if we can get those kind of people playing civ v!",82.5

"as a new civ player, i must say that i used to hate this type of strategy games (turn based) and considered my self an rts player instead. now that i tried civ 5, i must say that im hooked to the game and its innovative mechanics. playing against the ai is alaways fun, and the multiplayer experience is fantastic. the amount of customisations you can do to the game is great, especially with the addition of community content. the sound track is brilliant and the options menu has way more options than you could possibly need to tweak. if you are considering giving turn based strategy a go, i defiently recommend this game.",113.1
"this game is amazing. i started a quick game on a small map with 3 other people, 5 hours in and i only have half the map to myself! really takes time and it keeps you occupied, but it gets a bit annoying in late-game when you have many units and cities and you have to maintain all of them by building stuff, assigning tasks when you just wanna kill stuff. other than that, great! 9/10",26.4

"do not buy this game if you like having free time. its not a game one simply picks up for an hour or so. it is the video game equivalent of heroin: it will suck away hours of your life at a time, leaving you in a stupor afterwards, thinking only about when you can boot it up next and finally knock off that a-hole suleiman for good. its terrible but, its so, so good.",230.1

"ive spent nearly 200 hours on this insanely briliant game! is it good? you bet yo  it is!!!!!!!!! but if ur getting it buy the complete pack",205.6
"clearly the ai is this game`s greatest weakness but overall it`s a great game. the graphics are nice and the strategic aspects increased with the dlc`s. great to play with friends or other human players -> less ai and it is very addictiv if you start playing and intend to stop, it s just one more turn.... and another hour has passed or you start to realize that the sun just rose even thought you started playing at night",337.2
"i was playing this the night before an exam. at 11pm i thought just one more turn, cause that fer casmir betrayed me and sided with china. it seemed as if only an hour later i had taken over poland, china, indonesia and venice. it was 9am. 10/10 would fail an exam again.",373.7
"steam wants my opinion. ive seen empires rise and fall (mostly mine). i tried to stop. one more turn i will say for 80 more turns. then bam its 4 a.m. the world has forgotten about you. you have a final in an hour. you know? the final you said you needed a break in studying? but you know what? one more turn? 10/10 would conquer germany with poland again highly recommended",115.1
"the game mechanics of sid meiers civilization may be a lot to take in for people new to the franchise, but its definitely worth buying and learning to play. it takes time, but once you figure out how the game works, it is extremely fun and addicting. ive played civ 3 and 4 as well and also recommend those previous versions too.",256.9
"the game is very engaging. others can probably give you a much more thourough review, but i will say that, if you are going to pick this up, get the expansions. brave new world really adds a lot to the game.",114.5
"what a game! brilliant, pretty much one of my best game purchases on steam. whether you play single player or multiplayer this game is for anyone!. but be ready to be , you might be enjoying 300 turns of peace and you bullying small city-states, but then bam, boom, butt, your greatest ally backstabs you and destroys a game you have been playing on for a while. usually this makes me uninstall the game and give a  review. but this game is different, you are not complete until you buy this game, and bully civs",74.8
"fantastic fun, you could spend hours playing it. inituive gameplay and tutorials to help you get started. the addition of famouse historical leaders also enhance the fun. at the moment im trying to recreate the great british empire! i highly reccommend !",36.9
"pretty good game, and the dlcs are a must in my opinion. it got a little boring, but i kept getting back into it, lots of things to do, and different ways to play. especially fun with friends!",333.6

"fantastic game and very addictive howerver, civilization v is too expensive on steam. bring down the price a bit. prices range from just 7.50 up to 15 on various other sites. (jungle).",104.7
"definitely not a game you should start up when you have something important scheduled. you know, like... sleeping or eating. the just one more turn syndrome will keep ordinary things like these well out of your mind. try the marathon mode if you dare... the multiplayer mode used to be bit wonky but it pretty stable after the last patches. definitely get both expansions for the best experience (the complete edition is usually up for 10 bucks during the steam sales).",683.1
"this game was good on the free weekend, cant wait to eventually get it with the bundle! :d",61.6
"this game can get very addicting and is very fun in multiplayer. other strategy games multiplayers should mimic this one as well as have there one kind. how you play the game is very addictive and its like you never want to stop and always say just one mroe turn turns out to be 24 turns. def a must buy for anybody even if your not a big fan of strategy games, as this one doesnt require as much thought process as many other strategy games.",274.9

"if youve never played a civilization game before, the fifth iteration is a good place to start. a game of civlization is similar to a board game. theres no campaign or overarching story. you simply have one goal and thats to win a match. to do this you have many options that involve brute force, economical strategy, scientific advancement or some of the newer methods like influence and trade. the game is one thats easy to get lost in, before you know it, time has simply vanished. to me, that marks a good game.",32.3

"i have to admit-i was a little offput at first by this game. i was familiar with the concept and a very basic idea of how to play, but some things about the game seemed downright strange the first time i played. the hex tiles, the belligerent ai (yes, you montezuma), all of it kept me somewhat uninterested in this game for a while. but after a while of thinking, i started to understand the game more, and the more i understood it, the more i liked it. it is a complex game, and i certainly dont understand all or even most of it. but nontheless, it is a highly replayable game of great value that i enjoy greatly.",278.4

"this game is the best just the best the only best.",120.2
"simply amazing. being able to beat the game from numerous vantage points along many different civs on countless maps/sizes adds to replayability. love it to death!",405.3
"civilization v is the epitome of the civ series. i know many civ fans would say they think iv edges it out, but the additions in v combined with the faithful execution of the core civ formula puts this one on top. hex-based tiles make it all the more awesome, and the elimination of doomstacks with the one unit per tile limit makes the game much more tolerable and strategic in many ways. with the expansions, there is a whole lot of content to see, and the best part of the game is arguably whats great about every civ game: flexibility to play the way you want to play. different victory types will keep you interested for mulitple playthroughs, and, like all civ games, you will find yourself laughing when you find your civilization on the brink of destruction at the hand of ghandis army. just be warned: the zulunation probably hates you.",72.8
"played 180+ hours, didnt realise mods disabled achivements. 10/10",181.3
"this game has everything a strategy game needs to be a good one. it has easy to understand controls which can later on develop into more advanced controls, it has extensive gameplay, and it makes you use your brain. i would suggest this to anyone who likes games such as age of mythology, and perhaps starcraft ii.",106.8

"being a veteran in the civilization series, civilization v is definitely the worst in the series. that being said, it is a good game, but compared to other civilization games (such as civ iv and civ iii) this is no where compared to them. civilization iv is still the best out there. ive been playing civ since 2001. and for me, civ iv and civ 3 is better than 5. ive played over 1000000+ hours on all civilization games (including the expansions) so ignore the time count i have here. i just got civ v this late november of 2014.",68.1

"what can i say about civilization v... i am not a big fan of the strategy genre, yet this game has that charm, which makes me play it, makes me interested on how my civilization will live on. the game is really slow-paced, yet the time really flies playing it. graphics are pretty good, considering its a strategy game. this game pretty much never gets repetitive, everytime you can start differently, and win differently. only thing i dislike- 1 leader for entire civilization in ages. it kinda doesnt make sense to me, because the same leader living thousands of years... its weird. because of that, id rate this game a solid 9.5/10, i highly suggest you buy it.",26.9

"i swear to god ive only played it for about 15 minutes, but it claims ive racked up about 30 hours. the game lies, obviously, but its lies are sweet. like the finest honey. i recommend this game; although its terrible for your sleep pattern, social life, and your ability to hold down a job, youll soon come to realise the higher truth. which is that you dont care about any of those things- all you care about is getting revenge on that treacherous dog who declared war on you and building more giant death robots.",81.8

"civilization v is best enjoyed with the complete edition as it includes several new leaders / countries, religion, and balances to the game. this grand strategy has taken plenty of my hours away in both singleplayer and multiplayer; and is far better than beyond earth. this is easily the definitive civilization game if you want to get a group of friends together to conquer others.",83.8
"this game is probably one of my favorite games of all time. i sit down on a weekend to play for maybe an hour or so. so i start a new game and an hour later a realized that 5 or so hours have passed. so then i tell myself just one more turn and 1 turn later 50 turns have passed! this game is soooo addicting and i recomend purchasing the complete edition if you do get this game.",241.5

"this is very good game that gets boing after like 300-400 hours of play time. biggest drawbacks are: - ai of units - ai can build, win with you by science, but if you have like half a brain you will never lose by militarty conquest, it is most apparent in ai moves accross ocean - even having submarine dont help them, because they dont use them! ai had my battleship on plate, with two submarines in range, and it just moved it, without shotting at my ship. it was like most wtf moment in game, and i understood that unit moving was done by some half wit and not a programmer. other that that game is well balanced, i think it can be very entartaining form multiplayer purposes.",488.6
"amazing everything: graphics, gameplay you name it and it has it. win a peace, science, culture, or even a war victory. this is the game for you if you love these command, and strategy games. but the game does require an exceeding amount of patience as one game can last hours and still end up in loss, but it is absolutely one of the funnest things you can do on your devise and i would highley recommend getting it",112.0

(bnw was a revelation.) i couldve stuck with my friends accounts, but then we tried the multi-player interface and i got killed as my human buddies werent so forgiving. this game is great and makes you feel like you know history (which is rewritten depending on who youre playing as).",150.0

"when i purchased sid meiers civilization v i had no idea what i was getting into. **note** people have said you need the complete edition (dlcs and such) to make the game better, and theyre soooo right. being someone who has played with and without the dlcs i strongly reccomend buying the complete edtion over the standard edition. i played 7 hours in my first real sitting of civ v, and started out as playing alexander, ruler of greece, which was fun and all, but i didnt really enjoy playng as him. after that i convinced some friends of mine to get the game (since it was on sale) and now ill mostly play multiplayer with my friends. they all now love civilization v also and they always thank me for having them buy it. graphics - 8.5/10 gameplay - 9/10 replayability- 9/10 personal rating - 10/10 game! ps never trust ghandi",83.8

"brilliant game. civ 5 has a very good single player experience, although is amazing with friends in multiplayer. the only negative i have for this game is that as of yet, there seems to be no way to make the multiplayer ai any more or less difficult. the only way to change the pace would be to put a handicap on yourself. to get the full experience of the game, i suggest getting both of the expansion packs also, as this doubles the games content and replay ability. i highly recommend this game to anyone.",311.1

"oh hai!!!! i love this game. probably one of the best games ive played. theres a few things from civ 4 that i would put back in... and the expansion is fantastic as well. pick this up if you enjoy strategy, but keep in mind that 1 game can last up to 8 hours if you survive the early to mid game :) i give it 4.5 meows out of 5. wtf does that mean? who knows.....",393.8
"this is the biggest time destroying game ever created. there is no way to have a quick game in civ, to really enjoy it you have to start from ancient,you have to be playing agains friends and you must kill gandhi! 10/10 i love this game and i havent even wasted many hours on enough civs yet.",202.8

"ahh civ. time vampire extraordinaire... not much to say about the fifth installment if you already know the series other than: a) get both expansions, they add largely essential systems into the game (religion, tourism etc) you can usually pick them up in a sale somewhere for pretty cheap now. and b) picture the scene...its 4am, the curtains are still open...it must be getting light soon. the birds are chirping in the trees. you havent moved in the last 8 hours, those chores you were going to do, yeah, umm maybe tomorrow...you should probably think about going to bed, but.... eat my nukes ghandi!!. yep. that still happens, so 10/10. daylight, exercise, proper diet, sleep patterns, theyre so overrated anyway.",85.8

"have sank many hours into this game - a rich world and complex strategy game. flaws: multiple playthroughs can be repetitive. ai civilizations are often unpredictable, often declaring war on yours for no tangible reason, despite previous cooperation. i am told that the dlc packs go some way to fixing this.",208.1

"this game along with civ iv, has taken hudnreds of my gaming hours. if you like strategy games, and dont mind long games, try this game out. now be warned, if you plan on buying civ v, buy the two expansions! they add much needed mechanics that the devs forgot to put in civ v (unfortunately). but once you add the xpacks, this game will take many hours form you too! the game revolves around taking a control of a civilization (from nations like ashurbanipal of assyria all the way to napoleon of france) and, beginning at 4000 bc, you lead it all the way to the future age. you build, expand, and develop cities, and create alternate histories where the americans built the pyramids. i recommend this game to anyone willing to spend countless hours, but it is defiitely worth it!",355.6
"give history the finger and conquer the world with ghandi, or get voted as worldleader while player as gengis khan. civ is the only place where ceasar, washington, ramessess and napoleon are bombing each other with nukes. warning: this game is really addicting.",364.4
"blows all other turn-based strategy games out of the water, except of course xcom, which was deveoped by the same people. firaxis seriously knows what they are doing with their strategy games. the only beef i have is that if you want the full experience you have to buy gods & kings and brave new world. they add a lot to the game, and they are worth the money you are paying.",207.7
"an excellent addition to the civ series, streamlines a lot of micromanaging, uses hexes instead of squares, and has a totally overhauled (for civ) and awesome combat system. not quite up to alpha centauri levels of greatness, but superb nevertheless. on balance, better than civ iv (i say this as a former civ iv addict).",230.7
"civilization is like the best. its so relaxing to just have it your own pace and i am only writing this because is have too",27.7
"this game has so many ways to play its ridiculous. you can play as a warmongering america, or you can play as a cultural germany, or a scientific iroquois. the game is easy to pick up if you put a little time into it. the game runs clean and smooth on nearly everythng and for a over the top strategy game its awfully pretty too. multiplayer games can get very intense if youve a friend who has this game. great for lan parties because anything can happen. 9.5/10, only problem is it can get a bit gltchy in multiplayer with loading, but only vanilla civ v has this problem. definitely recommend getting the dlcs when they go on sale.",562.1
"nice game, it will let you to understand real historical actions (wars, coups etc.) and you will have a great time, especially playing with friends :)",437.4
"this is a great game. it is interactive, and has historic educational value. the multiplayer feature would be great, iif it didnt have so many server connectivity issues. this is a hard game to describe, you need to play it to believe it. this game is awesome.",159.3
"buy this game. buy it. if you have freetime buy it. if you are a busy person with a important job buy it, and let it ruin your life. this game is not for the filthy casuals. if you are a filthy casual then i give you a warning. this game will change your life.",46.3

"civ 5 - the only game when you can play as socialist realist russians against your stubborn muslim neighbors who wont open borders because they hate buying your blue jeans, so you tell them to tear down this wall by declaring war, sending hero of the people rock stars on tour, spreading your ideology, and influencing them with a cultural revolution to win without ever firing a shot. 10/10 - would civilize again... except it goes up to 11.",351.1
"bought it about a week ago,cant stop playing.btw,damn u ghandi!",25.8
"to be honest, this is one of my all-time favorite games. many mechanics are different than civ 4, so do your research first. in my opinion, they are all for the better. for example, cities can actually attack units. furthermore, you can no longer stack units. civ v now uses hexes for movement instead of squares. both of the expansions change the game in several ways. gods and kings adds religion and the ever-so-fun espionage. brave new world adds ideologies (which can become powerful enough that you can convert cities to your empire), revamped-diplomacy, revamped trade, and encourages working with other civs (not that you have to). the base game itself is fantastic, and each add-on only makes it better.",553.9
"you need to understand that when i recommend this game, i do it as one recommends heroin. dont let the hours logged fool you, i have another 150 offline at the bare minimum. this is one of those games where you dont stop playing once youve started, the turns are so deliberate, one miscalculation can cost you anything in this tense, albeit slow-paced game. this game can ruin your life if you let it, but it fills that gaping hole in your heart that the death of board games like risk has left.",263.0
"it is probably one of my favorite games ever!!! so, with the mods, i can just about do anything with this. this game is super fun, eventhough i play on the easy mode. i love the game b/c of the wonders. im a wonder-freak, so this game provides it. the graphics and game-style make it to the point that it isnt the regular boring turn-based game. this game rocks!!! 9.99/10",639.3
"are you prepared to use ghandi as your instrument of war against the genghis khan and his ally, george washington, in a race for nuclear weapons? this is a game you play if you have a full month to kill. its a game where you start at 7pm and then stop playing at 8am because you have to go to work. this is the definition of video game crack.",43.1

"while many say its much simpler than civ 4, that doesnt stop it being an absolutley amazing game.",196.9
"in my opinion, civ v with the latest dlcs is the best civ to date. exceptional re-playability, trophies, entertainment and balance. of course it has been around long enough to hone itself to near perfection. easily recommended for any 4x gamer who somehow has never heard of civ or sid meier.",592.3

"im not gonna lie, games like this i dont really enjoy. but this is something else. it can look quite confusing to begin with however from the guidence of a few friends i was running my own empire, founding new cities and creating a religion. under my control japan was ruling the world. and i was loving it to say the least. the multiplayer works slightly differently but with a few friends its still great fun! overall and amazing game. and i cant really complain when i got the full game plus all the dlc for only 8.99!",44.2

"my first game, i found 2 ais the names of these are gandhi and atila the hun. we traded and made strong friendships with each other. 20 turns later i saw gandhi had some giant death robots near my border all of a sudden i noticed atila had some submarines with nuclear missiles. in the blink of an eye my people in my capital were screaming and my empire was on fire and i lost my only friends. 10/10 when i see gandhi or atila in my games i now rethink my life, quit civ and start crying",282.5

"this is civilisation! intitally i couldnt get into the hex grid which was a departure from the earlier games. however after a while i barely noticed it. the expansions have only added to this. if you havent played this by now and it is your type of game then you need to own this.

"i have always been a fan of the civilization series. i have to admit that i was nervous to try civ v, considering the all new hex grid and no unit stacking. once i played the complete edition, with all of the dlc and expansions, i was hooked!! this game is well rounded, and every game is just as fun as the first!",113.4
"you can play this game for hours at a time. honestly you lose track of time as you head right through the game into the modern era. 66 hours is a lot if you ask me and thats how long you can spend time playing this game. they did a great job with the game. my only complaint is the automatic camera movement. it can get annoying at times and you might accidentally move your unit to the wrong spot because of it. other than that is an overall great game and i reccommend it to everyone who loves turn based strategy games.",97.7
"fun strategy game, i would recommend it for anyone who likes tactics or strategy. very confusing to understand at first but you slowly adapt to the game the more you play, maybe reading or getting help about the game would help you. still trying to understand the game more and im so far enjoying the game. and playing together with your friends is probably the most fun part about the game in my opinion. 9/10",33.2

"wow... this game, this entire franchise is simply genius! it seems like such a simple topic at first, and like so many other dominate the world through first=person m-rated combat games, but once you start playing, you realize that its far more in-depth and dynamic and just plain addictive than those. plus, it isnt rated m. that ability to bo one of the best games (in my opinion), like minecraft, terraria and the zoo tycoon franchise (all of which i love) is really a pretty herculean task in a world dominated by violence-addicted teens who would love nothing more than to lop a strangers head off. way to go, sid!",342.1
"i was a day 1 purcahser of vanilla civ v. my initial imprassion was that it was a hollow game and it did not contrast well with civ iv and civ ii. i recently picked up civ v complete and have put quite a few hours into it, including a marathon pangea on prince with 22 civs on standard. it was a one more turn experience which prompted me to change my review to positive. the good: hexes: they obsolete all previous games. audio-visual; especialy the impressionistic art, the leaderheads, and the great works. the religion system is really good. the trade system is good. the bad: the culture system is not a dynamic as it was in civ iv. likewise, civics were more intuitive than policies. the ugly: the ai cannot fight. one unit per tile. the two are linked, in my mind.",469.1

"civ 5 is a brilliant game. it has beautiful graphics, perfect performance (on proper machines that can take it) with detailed and handy systems for creating your own civ. i suggest the dlc due to its offering of a new religion you can personalise which is always fun. gets boring pretty quickly, ive found it best to play in multiplayer with friends as it gets very boring very quickly as theres not much action at the start, even if you set the speed to fast. beautiful will run on most computers boring at points",33.2

"this game is an excellent upgrade from civilization iv. they removed the superstacks of soldiers and limited it to one type of unit per tile and that is a major improvement. the base civilizations are varied and some are from more hidden parts of history, which is a nice change of pace. the new tile design of hexagons is also a nice change, helping with a strategy change. however, one of my gripes are the achievements. you get them by just playing the game. eliminate another civ, upgrade a unit, find ruins, etc... even though they have no gameplay impact it is offputting to see supposed achievements in the grand scheme of human achievement those may be, but in this sort of game setting they are not applicable. overall, a great upgrade from civ iv that gets rid of the unnessecary while keeping the fundamentals intact.",82.6

"an amazing game with little faults, sid meiers civilization v is a beautiful crossover of total war and age of empires. play as alexander the great, augustus ceizer or even napolean as you make your way to world peace or world domination! play as an ancient civilization and work you way up through eras which are different ages sorted with different technologies and items. as well as a historical game, civilization v is a strategy turn-based game completely mad on your choices! destroy the french, make peace with the chinese, eliminate the roamans, whatever you want! it also serves as a window to learning more about history, except in a really amusing way! i rate this 9/10 for its amazing gameplay and the re-playability.",47.2

"great game i have tons of hours on it. the only thing i have to say bad about the game are the countless nights i have lost sleep over just because i couldnt put the thing down. tons of interesting civilizations to play as and the maps are always stunning and 100% unique. the multiplayer can take a long time to find a match unless you have a preplanned thing with friends which is were you probably get the best multiplayer experience anyway. not any bugs that i have run into frequently especially in the single player which is polished to perfection. any strategy fan could easily get lost in this game play for hours on end. on top of that all the dlc add a whole new dimenson to the game. buy it you wont regret it.",755.8

"hey, got twenty hours to waste? civilization v is the one turn-based game that has me saying one more turn. most i am able to leave rather quickly whenever i need (such as moo, or galciv), however there is something in civilization v that just forces you to play that next turn to try and set yourself up for your next session. interesting visuals, dlc already added freely to the game, and a completely supported modders distribution system helps make this not only the most complete, but also a quite improved entry into the series.",48.6
"this game was simply fantastic; i really enjoyed the overall gameplay and the graphics. the civilization interface was purely complex, which i enjoyed, becuase it kept me on my toes the entire game and between every new game because the interaction was different every time. i do have to say, however, if you are looking for a better game with a tad worse graphics then try out civilization iv as it was far superior in overall gameplay throughout your entire story.",207.4
"out of all my games on steam civ v is by far my favourite, and most played game. as a game it offers some of the most sought out content: choice (the ability to choose your nation and how to build your civ), strategy (the need to make plans and revise them as the game goes on), great ai (sometimes ruthless ai), multiplayer, etc. all in all a great game!",367.3
"positives: - an in depth strategy game. - fun with friends and by fun by yourself vs ai. - easy to learn and hard to master. negatives: - online matches are rarely finished due to the sheer length of a single game. - can become quite repetitive with certain strategies and skill trees being more powerful than others.",132.3

"best turn based strategy game series of all time definately worth a look if you like strategy games",246.2
"a great game that lets you devise tactics and an economy on a much easier and user friendly scale. you really never know what will happen especially playing with the ai and the maps (unless you do something otherwise) are completely random and force you to adapt. the very first game i played of this, i couldnt walk away and sat just playing it for 10 hours straight. this game is a must buy if you love strategy games and want something easy to learn and hard to master.",110.0
"civilization v.... sitting on the pinnacle of steam top purchases basking in the adoration of strategy players and your here with a blank look on your face wondering what it is. well take a couple of minutes of your god forsaken miserable life to lift your eyes of your daily degenerate lifestyle to comprehend the apex of gaming. civilization 5 is a strategy based game that revovles around turn based decisions and adaption to environtment and resources around you to achieve various types of victories. if you have patience and are a veteren rts/strategy player you would enjoy this.... well i did anyway.",1006.6

"at first i didnt see many reasons to play online without someone i know so in the back of my mind i was regretting clicking on multiplayer, but after playing as indonesia in a group of 6 other online players, i saw how intense this turn-based could become. i can assure everyone that the multiplayer is 9000 times more intense than the singleplayer (against ai) and the only way to find that out is by playing multiplayer. for the nutmeg!!!",111.5

"not exactly like the other civs, a feature for which it got some criticism, civ v expands on the series in such a way that pleased me both aesthetically and in gameplay. while it is certainly less complex than earlier installments in the series, civ v is far more intuitive and more fun to play, yet it still retains enough of the complexity to be an engaging turn based strategy game. its also great for multiplay.",434.7
"its a very good strategy game, especially with the dlcs. vanilla is nothing compared to iii and iv, but g&k makes it worth it.",123.3
"such an impressive game, it deserves more recognition",194.6

"ive been playing this game for like 15 hours now, its actually pretty fun! at first i was like whoa dude everyone is so addicted to this game called civ 5 and thought psshh they probably exaggerating. but then i tried it out myself, theres a lot of stuff to learn about it at first but once you learn all that in like an hour or two. its all set sail from there. it really reminds me of playing age of empires and red alert 1 back in the day. brings back nostalgic memories. this game is very deep like miley cyruss . you can easily sink in many many hours into it. i would definitely rate this game a 9.5/10. its like miley cyrus, great visuals and very deep.",38.2
"really fun. it just get better with friends online too. perfect if you have the time for a good marathon game.",62.3
"bit expensive with all the dlc but, is still plenty of fun if your into a turn based take-over the world game.",775.1
"the first game in the civ series not to be better than the one before, but not in a bad way. its different. gameplay has been changed so much, this is not really the evolution of civ iv, but a reimagining of the whole game. new hexagonal grid, improved victory conditions, completely revamped politics and religions (moreso with dlcs gods and kings/brave new world), civilizations that change the gameplay much more. now you cant stack military units. even this simple change makes war so much different. now you cant siege a city with 50 riflemen on the same square or defend it with with 40 pikemen. if you liked older civ games or you just like turn based strategy, you wil love this game so much.",219.5
"the game is good, yet sometimes there is major resets where you go back 50-something turns, which for me was the biggest minus, now startegy is good, and the options are also, the option turn timer or game pace was probably the best options. the 1 civ dlcs were a terriable idea, why not just make an update? sure gods and kings, which is a great expansion, but 1 civ dlcs? also a minus... but the game is great, 9/10",271.9
"very addicting, bnw expansion is great. dont trust ghandi.",164.4

"yes it is a very fun game and with the dlcs it makes it even more fun than before",26.8
"the biggest sink time ever...never play this game when you have something else to do. the one more turn comercial is more of a real ad than a joke. this game is too addictive.",64.2
"you cant get a much better deal than with civ v. the gameplay is flawless and still highly addictive even though i have played for a year.",361.5
"very fun addicting game. be prepared to spend countless hours of your life in this turn based game.",925.7
"do you have a free weekend or no job? do you enjoy sitting in a chair beind a screen for extended periods of time? maybe you are 14? possibly 25 and no job and your mom doesnt bother you much? well, civ 5 is the game for you! watching small groups of people inhabit a hexigon and watching other people invade other hexigons is a blast. youll need to beat your wife and kids so they know not to bother you. order pizza turn off your phone and let the magic happen. you cant stop this. this game will end relationships.",55.5

"the most important detail is the title screen msuic, civ 4 took the cake by having the best title screen music i have ever heard. buying civ 5 (gods & kings) i was expecting it to have bad music. slowly it became my favorite. good job! besides the title screen music the game improved 110%. every area was improved. 5 stars.",277.8
"this awesome game is extremely addictive and one of the most complex strategy games i have ever played. it has taken me over 60 hours of gameplay to fully grasp even the vanilla version of the game and a further 40 hours to even become good at it, lol. the dlcs added heaps of content, refining the whole game into something even more better and worth way more than 6 keys in total for g&k and bnw. played 120 hours and counting; maybe a further 100 hours will satisfy me of this game :l. most immersive ruler scenes and the fact the sejong-korea and also ethiopia is in the game truly amazes me about the range of diversity in the game. 10/10",278.3

"ever imagined yourself as king or president? well, heres your chance! sid meier brings you civilization 5, a beautiful 4x strategy game where you take the role of a leader of a people. throughout the game you will experience change, advancement, and trouble, or riches. you can also play the game in many different ways, depending on how you want to win. honestly, this game easily makes my top three games of all time, and i wish i could explain better, but this game has so much to offer its incredible. this game has so many features and possiblities its breath taking, and if you dont think this is enough to intrigue you, i personally suggest you go watch the yogscast or someone else play it. oh, btw, never. ever. trust gandhi.",152.8

"takes a bit of time to learn how a civ game works, but this is worth playing.",153.5
"brilliantly designed game with a great multiplayer feature and, while heavy, the game barely every crashes or stops responding. i highly recommend it, but only if you have some friends to play it with. theres no problem with the singleplayer, but it gets boring after a while and i rarely finish a single player game because they take forever and you lose interest around half-way through. still a great game, and sid meier is held very highly in appreciation for this series.",947.7

"go for it, such a great game to play with friends. the game has a save function even for multiplayer, so dont worry about the fact that most games go for quite a long time, simply save, and return later with your friends. on top of that, the game can get a little weird and wonderful when you play a dead civilisation, and end up winning with it. does age of empires let you play future egyptians with death robots? i think not.",101.5

"this game is great, just dont be dissapointed when it is impossible to win without a war as the ai seems to have either mood swings or multiple personality disorder. you can shower them with gifts or trade non-stop with them but as soon as your borders are visible from theirs or you have a weak military they will pounce on you without hesitation. they even say backstap in the dialogue box, this annoys me as i want to play the game nicely but very few of my friends have the game and random online matches often have dlc which i do not. im sorry about this mini rant, this game is fabulous and the repeatability amazing but seriously if you want to play vs ai peacefully get a mod.",163.0

"to be frank, this is likely the most addictive game of all time. it kind of galls me that i spent so much on my pc, bought so many aaa titles, and it is one of the most graphically simple that has the most replay value. if youve ever liked any strategy game ever, civ v is simply a must have. it is a genre defining title. for anyone who has ever played any of the other civ games, it is just as great as the games of yesterday. is it as complex as civ iv, with as much fine attention to detail? no. but it is equally great in its own ways, and for shear playbility, replay value, and the easy learning curve (especially compared to previous civ titles) it is a game you really must give a try.",419.2

"even if youve never played the civilization series, this game is a must have for any turn-based strategy fan. dozens of empires for you to choose from consisting of their own unique bonuses and several unique units. no two game plays will be the same. you can either play a short match (1-2 hours) or one that could last days up against the ai or online multiplayer. amazing graphics, an absolutely stunning soundtrack, and immense depth are just scrapes off the surface of what this game truly presents.",110.9

"this is what i play when im supposed to be doing homework. it really takes a lot of skill and makes you think so much about every move. multiplayer with friends is the best, especially when you all end up just foofin around making deals of giving one gold for nothing :d and time just flies by and you just cant get tired of it because every round brings so much to do, all the possibilities, man!",221.3
"the real game the best game the biggest game thumbs up",425.4
"this game takes up time, but so does any great strategy game. the only problem i can see with this is you really need either gods and kings or brave new world dlc to fully enjoy it. it may be me playing with it for so long, but whatever. it is really well constructed, gandhi still goes on nuke rampages. ai is pretty well written, graphics and animation are beautiful. it is really just one of the best strategy pc games out there. tenouttaten would recommend to anyone. another note: to fully enjoy graphics you should have a decent pc. that aside, anyone on any computer can enjoy this. enjoy folks!",265.4
"addicting, and a hell alot of fun! alot of ways to win, and the multiplayer is super fun!",4.3
"great game if you are looking for a game you can invest time in, would reccomend that you get the gold edition for the gods and kings dlc.",60.2
"this is the best stratagy game there is! its a bit expensive but its well worth it.",44.1
"a worthy addition to this franchise. the new hex system gives players an incredible new way of thinking and plotting the demise of your fellow empires.",171.6
"with the gods & kings expansion (and now brave new world), this is still the best grand strategy game overall. you could cherry-pick features from old versions and probably make the ultimate strategy game, but as it is, this is great work.",97.4
"warning: this game is addictive. you will find yourself spending hours to defeat your opponents. and you will enjoy every minute of it.",17.4
"best turn based strategy game ever! :d, recommended to all!",451.0
"i can say this is arguably one of the greatest games ive ever played. if you love diplomacy, war, strategy, and politics in general, this is the game for you. if you pick it up, at least pick up the brave new world dlc but try for the gold edition as a whole. you wont be dissapointed, i sure as hell wasnt.",93.0
"i thought i wasnt going to like this game very much, i totally fell in love with the strategy and game style.",187.7
"love this game. spent many a day taking over the world and usually stomping the french into the ground. it can take quite a while to get through each round, but thats expected since you go from a couple thousand bc to the modern age. the scenarios offered are a nice little change from the base game.",609.1
"this game is so addictive, 1 hour feels like 10 minutes",25.0
"this is possibly the best strategy game i have ever played it is a great game to play with friends and requires you to be extremely smart to survive",22.7
"hm. if steam had a star rating system, i would give it 3. the gameplay is great for a strategy game, brilliant in fact, but unless you shell out the sixty-some dollars for all the dlc, it just isnt worth much. i got it from the nice fellows at humble hundle, so i got off easy. but poor you, waiting for a 60% sale. and if you want to connect with your friends, be prepared for a ton of space usage (that said, i dont have the best internet provider, per se). of course, with said dlc, its great. immersive, tons of strategy, and will keep you entertained for until you need to keep yourself sustained. truly fun. worth keeping on your wishlist for sure, but unless you and your friends have the dlc, be prepared for a semi-fun six-hour marathon of civ that leaves you awkwardly unsatisfied until you come back.",132.7
"completely fun and addicting would recommend to everyone. late game can be a little frustrating if you are going for a domination-victory.",62.9
"gods and kings makes this game really fun. think beyond the sword and civ5, then take out the boring parts of control. religion is done the best it has ever been done in civ imo. if you liked civ4 then give civ5 gods and kings a chance.",274.9
"very good a lot of fun and the mods are super 10/10",341.5
"civililization 5 is one of my most played games with infinate replay value. the level of detail is just right not being to micro and not too big picture. however it is a little weak on the whole idea of foren policy withought the brave new world dlc witch adds it in and makes just going to war for no reason veary bad.",132.7

"yes. this game is very strategic. the base game is as completely awesome as it seems. the trailer tells all. however, if you like getting emerged in to games, this game is just okay for it. its an awesome multiplayer experience and probably the best of all the civilization games in the series. altogether, the game is about a 7/10. the game supports workshop as well, which is always nice. i just wish you could get more emerged and feel like youre really in the game. the music is very nice as well. nothing is better than dominating the world and nuking and obliterating anyone who stands in your way!",434.5
"cid meierss civilization v is a very good turn based game. you should consider trying out the game. it has a built in multiplayer, and has a very tactical game play.",59.8
"good game for lots of people to play while drunk...",40.0
"its the best turn-based strategy game ive played so far. 20 years of gaming. anything better than this is going to blow my mind. $30 is a fair price. youll find yourself coming to this game for years. for me, this is a game ill play with friends until were all dead (in rl).",37.2
"civilization v is one of the best games ive ever played. as a lover of strategy, i would recommend this to anybody that enjoy thinking long hours. if you love to build empires, fight wars, and conquer and rule empires, then this is a game for you!",122.0
"love this game! you will need both expansions to truly appreciate it. the gods and kings expansion added quite a bit to game play but with the latest expansion brave new world, more elements have been included such as trade routes, tourism, etc. that enhance the game even more. all that being said, diplomacy is still poorly executed in the game so beware of this negative aspect and enjoy what is a very good, if not excellent (4x) tbs game.",982.7
"one of the best strategy games out there. the dlcs are pricey, but 35 for the base game + all dlc is a good deal in my opinion. would definitley recommend this to anyone looking for a fun strategy game! :)",74.7
"cvilization v is one of the best turn-based strategy games in existence. especially after the release of brave new world, the new expasnion for the game, it has gotten alot more interesting. even though the combat is kind of dull and weird compared to other games, it makes up for it in the grand scheme of things. its really fun to see your empire spread across the maps, which vary to endless variations, with the new map-tool for modders its almost impossible to say what cant be played on in this game. the multiplayer is also very very fun",342.3
"this one of the best games ive played. i would recommend completely as long as you are okay with the small consequence of your life being consumed by its amazingness.",191.6
"i think this game is great me and my friends play the multiplayer and have games that last 12 hours until the final player is killed off the face of the universe. if you got a day where you dont have anything to do i suggest you play this game.",86.7
"all my history lessons amount to nothing compared to what i have learnt in civ. rulers live for eternity with little or no challange by the people, often leading to the peoples death. ghandi is infact a warmongering dictator who enjoys watching your people suffer as his elephants destroy you fields and despite the advance in technology some of these immortal tyrants still chose to have a spear and stand outside of a mudhut when talking to you about research agreeements and trading oil. the most important thing to take from civ is that fact we dont have many years left on this world. the end of the world isnt 2012 but instead 2050.",115.5
"became friends with gandhi and didnt get nuked. love it.",24.5
"best round-based political strategy game. the dlcs are fine, but not mandatory, but you should have all addons, because they really improve the depth of the game",162.6
"although i largely played real time strategy before i got this as a present, i still greatly enjoyed it. it was made even more enjoyable when i picked up the dlc during a sale. this game is a great game, and it has certainly made me more interested in civ and turn based games in general. it has a nice feel to it, and one day i plan on picking up civ iv and iii just to try them. 8/10 without dlc, 9.6/10 with dlc.",28.3

"i have over 1000 hours playing this game. fully 50% of that is probably in the please wait between turns, waiting for the computer ais to act. the game isnt the best of its kind (thats sid meiers alpha centauri) but its a great game to relax with. what i often do is take my turn, and then, while the game is processing all the ai players and im waiting for my next turn, i do something productive. ive gotten a lot of work done while playing this game.",1041.9

"excellent game. probably one of the best strategy games ever by the legendary sid meier. i strongly recommend getting all of the expansion packs with this game (gods and kings & brave new world) due to the sheer amount of content included. the community mods for this game are endless and this sandbox will never get old.",1046.2

"a very fun, replayable game. i think that it is a good game to play when you have a significant amount of time to waste. i will say however, that i find it hard to play if it the sole thing i am doing as it can be very monotonous clicking the next turn button constantly, especially if you are playing single player. the multiplayer does make this game as great as it is though. playing with 2/3 friends is quite the experience when you have to work together to defeat a common enemy when ultimately you will have to go your own course in your pursuit of victory. a much recommended game, in my honest opinion and well worth the money.",349.4
"very good a lot of fun and the mods are super 10/10",341.5
"love this game! you will need both expansions to truly appreciate it. the gods and kings expansion added quite a bit to game play but with the latest expansion brave new world, more elements have been included such as trade routes, tourism, etc. that enhance the game even more. all that being said, diplomacy is still poorly executed in the game so beware of this negative aspect and enjoy what is a very good, if not excellent (4x) tbs game.",982.7
"one of the best strategy games out there. the dlcs are pricey, but 35 for the base game + all dlc is a good deal in my opinion. would definitley recommend this to anyone looking for a fun strategy game! :)",74.7
"as portugals army lines up near my borders i know that war is inevitable. as my army marches to defend the borders, war is declared and the line of destruction begins. as one city falls, my army faces off against portugal. knowing my army is the largest in the world, i find myself feeling overconfident as my men head to their utter destruction one after another. it slowly dawns on me that my men are using medieval tech against portugals superior modern tech. as this realization comes to pass, my empire is in ruins as i try to muster what army i have left... great game and endless fun. 20/10",150.1
"well fleshed out game, easy to join friends games. would recommened if youre into turn based stargey games!",75.3
"this is a great game! its less complex than its predecessor, civilization iv, which serves to make the game a lot easier to learn and progress in. i highly reccomend downloading the gold edition and brave new world dlcs as well, as these prove to completely revolutionize the game. unlike most other games dlcs, these serve to completely revamp the game and make it an even more enjoyable experience. pick a civilization, load a game, and build an empire to stand the test of time!",540.3

"what the hell! i have played civ iii for long time, i have not playde civ iv, so i dont know what thats like. first thing i see, is that starting a game is simplified a lot. then i start a game, what the f*ck, why is here this stupid guide telling me that i should build a city, why, no other civ game i have played had sh*t like that! i dont need no guide, and if you cant play without a guide, you should not play a complicated strategy game. then i tried to manage my city, but the managing thing was simplified too, i could not do anything else than choose what to build, also, i heard i have less than 2 citizens. do not buy this game unless you want another casual piece of garbage!

"its a really good strategy game, if you want to buy it buy the complete edition because youll need it later...",223.0
"its not as confusing as it looks edit: having realised how absolutely useless my review is, ive decided to rewrite it in as much detail as possible. civ 5 is by far the best strategy game in existence (except possible for previous civ 4). despite this, i would definitely recomend civ 5 over any other game in the series, especially the new civ: beyond earth, as it offers a much better all round experience. the graphics are beautiful in their relative simplicity, although the game stops fitting my monitor past 1900x1200. you can play it fine on your own (many of my best games have been against bots) but if you are going to play it with friends make sure you are going to get together enough to finish it. it would make me very happy if you bought this game; because it will make you very happy and im like happy. enjoy <3",128.4

"this game is great, but it can get addicting, so beware. the vannila game is good but not as good as the dlc game, its worth giving the dlc a try. one bad thing is with the vanilla game it lacks a lot of things i was used to in civ four, like stacking units, but this isnt really a huge problem, its adds to the game in a way. the replayabilty is huge, kinda like spore, and it is increased with the dlc. please get this game, it is epic! build an emipire to stand the test of time!",41.8
"four years after its release, its still an entertaining game. much of it can nourish your brain with strategic imaginations, lifetime ideas as well as historical learnings. much of what the era is here all depends on you. you can even control historical leaders too! notably bonaparte napoleon! pretty much like those city games but this one delievers alot more than those kinds of games. and hey, dlcs of this game is twice the fun!",23.8

"this game is great fun. if you like strategy games that are also fun to play with friends this is your game. however, vanilla civilization v is terrible, no strategy just war forget everything else. so if you do buy make sure you also get the brave new world dlc too. (it adds trade routes, world congress, spying, religion, other improvements and much needed additional civilizations to play as) otherwise vanilla will just get repetetive and boring really quick. hope this helps i love civ v so if you have questions just ask.",521.4
"when it comes to turn-based over real-time, civ is king. gloriously complex, different every time, and a game that praises thinking and strategy over brute force and dumb luck. that doesnt mean you cant zerg, turtle or rush, it just means you can play your way. it does suffer from some horrible graphical bugs, which i would have hoped they would have fixed by now - but this just makes it look ugly at times, its still a fantastic game.",16.0

"most likely the best game i have ever played on the pc. its great when you play it sp because you get to try the game out, and figure out how the victories and different types of units work. but mp i find is the best because well with random people i find it ruins it because they are extremly aggresive and are usually unreasonable and more but with a friend games can last hours if played right. overall just great graphics, great gameplay and great game.",483.7

"civilization 5 is one of those amazing games that makes you stay up till 6 in the morning, downing red bull, screaming when you finally eliminate that  who took your tiny town over 200 turns ago, however you just tok his capital. the game runs smoothly on basically any machine, and mines a brick. if it doesnt run smoothly in normal mode, theres a tactical mode that basically can run on a toaster. that is, if that toaster has directx 9. you will play hundreds on hundreds of turns. you will stay up till the break of dawn. and you will love every second of it. 11/10 would buy again",108.3
"civ remains the end all, be all of country simulations, especially because you dont have to win through force: the scientific space race is here as always, along with diplomatic and cultural victories, and these separations really make each country feel distinct. i havent played a civ game in years, so i cant speak to folks talking about how 5 here is in some ways inferior to 4. from what ive seen i think they were trying to simplify some of the more mundane aspects, like plotting roads, with more broad strokes. i think its pretty spiffy keen- even without me bonnie scotland - and thats saying something.",100.8

"really seemed overly simplified. the dlcs are all terrible, and pretty much the only differnce between factions now is a singular special unit (which is what most of the dlcs were). the hex system is okay, but not great, but overall your better off playing the old games, unless you really like casual gameplay. if you want a civ game to play go play galactic civ. much better series of games. overall with the ratings for this game being as high as they are im a bit horrified by the lack of relevent reviews this game recieved. it feels like a stripped down version of previous games with very little new improvements aside from the grid system (which you can only move one unit on a square at a time which many folks like myself hate). overall this game is less then previous civ games in every way i can tell and gives you a civ aftertaste, but no substance to chew on.",6.0

"this is a turn based strategy game with very nice graphics. its very intense at times. if you enjoy strategy games that you can dump 6 hours into and not even feel it, you will love civ 5. the dlcs for this game make it feel complete, gods and kings is what brings the religion as well as espionage, back into the civilization series; which fits very nicely into this game. brave new world is very fun; it adds alot to the game ( trade routes, new civs, new policy system). out of all my hours ive never seen any bad that takes value away from the game. however, the base game alone will not have as much depth as if you had gold edition or bnw. i highly recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games.",261.9

"this is a turn based strategy game with very nice graphics. its very intense at times. if you enjoy strategy games that you can dump 6 hours into and not even feel it, you will love civ 5. the dlcs for this game make it feel complete, gods and kings is what brings the religion as well as espionage, back into the civilization series; which fits very nicely into this game. brave new world is very fun; it adds alot to the game ( trade routes, new civs, new policy system). out of all my hours ive never seen any bad that takes value away from the game. however, the base game alone will not have as much depth as if you had gold edition or bnw. i highly recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games.",261.9

"thoroughly enjoyable play, nice graphics, however somewhat infuriating. it is very daft to not have an auto-save feature, perhaps save the last ten moves automatically then you could still go back, if necessary, ten moves or back to the full save. this feature would not be so crucial except that the linux version of the game frequently crashes saving no progress; a simple request for an internet account password or even tabbing between applications causes complete meltdown. i would recommend if above issues were rectified.",50.7

"i really like this game. i really enjoy what its about. but i cant say that it should be picked up. i played one day for 12 hours straight casue was great. but then reality comes in and you feel a repitition , there isnt any real faction trait thatll make you want to try another, you can easily get every upgrade, every fight is easy and the waiting to finish game wanders off and you wont stay to finish. there are many maps and mods for factions but its all the same. you will play this game a lot and never put it away. but the fun factor will disappear real quick. least you get it with your friends, it might be worth it. or get it on a steam sale.",40.1

(sometimes its hard to get the computer to trade with you) 4. there is random personalities option, whitch grants other civs random personalities.

"i dont know why this game is so popular. of course its always funny when you start playing at 20:00 and realise 6 hours lather that its now 2:00 in the morning, or when you declare war on ghandi. but the main problem of this games is the lack of elements of gameplay. its too easy to win battles, you just need to train more units than the ennemy. at some point its not even fun anymore. it might get very boring sometimes !",48.2

(gods & kings, and brave new world). theyre huge really game changing expansions. like adding religion to the game, which could mean the difference between friendship or nuclear war. as far as time goes, you start in the year 4000 bc (by default). and progress your empire through the ages all the way into the future. even though beyond earth (next entry in civ) is already on the horizon, civ 5 is a true masterpiece. buy this game now.",102.2
"this game provides literally hundreds of hours (or more) of fun. the randomness of the maps, the large amount of civilizations, the multiple different ways to victory, and the many ways to achieve that makes this game so unique that its impossible for it to feel repetitive. this is well worth the cost and definitely a game to get. now if youll excuse me, i have to get back to playing!",122.0
"probably in the top 5 game ever made, it is the second game in the civilization universe i have ever played with the first being civilization on the ps3, the amount of detail put into the game is so entirely breathtaking that i could literally play this game for days, in fact ive had it for less than a week and im already closing in on a full day of gameplay... 5 out of 5. cant wait to see where beyond earth takes the franchise but i can pretty much gaurantee i will be there to see!",28.3

"civ 5 is an excellent blend of singleplayer and multiplayer. the singleplayer is fast paced and fun. it can also help you build skill in the game. the multiplayer is a great blend of backstabbing, friendship, and war. it is fun to explore different worlds and bring your civ to greatness and glory. overall, i give this game a 9/10. an excellent game!",74.6
"great soundtrack, has some sense of education to it for people who are vaguly interested in history. obviously if you play with ghandi he will be historically accurate and stock up on nucleur warheads and put the entire world consisting of 3 continents into a cold war or m.a.d. and when you play as venice make sure you become a real life banker and get loads of bonuses and make sure everyone is denpendant on you for their economy. also the multiplayer experience is not that bad the connections between players can be dodgy so frequent saving is an order, and combat is ok despite the quick animations. if you dont have this game....get it on sale or wait until the next civ gme in a few months....listen to your advisors....exept your military one...dont be like me",540.9

"a great game with enough of a mix of classic mechanics and new ones to keep the series fresh. the new combat mechanics are a great improvement over the stack of death from previous games and i still love the national borders. i dont like the fact that you have to buy expansions to get some of the older series staples like culture victories. still definitely a buy in my opinion. just one more turn lol.",152.7
"good game. takes a long time to play though. better dipomacy needed.",347.7
"one of the most realistic empire builders ive ever played. in an attempting such realism, there are almost too many mechanics in play. it takes a considerable amount of time and effort to fully understand and, in my experience, truly appreciate, the complexity. while the increased graphics can often slow the game (especially towards the mid-end game), its beautifully designed, and gorgeous to observe. plus, theres an option to turn on/off quick movement and qiuck battle which will help the game run faster.",408.1

"allow me to tell you a story. after approximately 8 victorys achieved by world domination, i decided to be peaceful. through various treaties, gifts, and negotiations i reached the status friends with everybody in the world. this made me happy. i was a respectable man in the world, with a low amount of troops and a high amount of manufactored goods. then greece came along. they, along with 3 allies, stabbed me in the back and send about 20 units of pikemen to take my capital, which they succeded in doing. after this loss, i proceeded to curl up in a ball and cry, vowing to never play again. 10/10 would play again.",188.6

"im going to get carpel tunnel playing this game. its hours on end fun. its always just one more move. the history is interesting, i like hearing about historical figures. fun.",191.3
"i absolutely love this game! with so many ways to win and endless hours of gameplay between normal dlc contnet to mods on the steam workshop its definitely a must have in my book.",61.9
"absolutely love this game. it is a fantastic edition to the franchise when all dlc is included with the purchase. the marthon mode is easily my favorit mode, however, if you dont have a beefy processory (mines an intel core 2 duo... yeah) any game mode larger then just four civs easily bogs the game down.",238.6
"can play this game for years at a time, no pun intended. this game does take up so much time. well worth it.",245.4
"great game, worth every penny ive spent on it. not good if you enjopy having a social life.",394.9
"possible side effects for playing this game are: lost sense of time, sleep loss, convincing yourself for just one more turn, anger issues, trust issues, gandhi issues, believing you can be a good leader, complete loss of social life, mental and physical health loss, addiction, and possible hallucinations of hexagons.",305.0
"civ is the only franchise ive routinely played for nearly a quarter of a century. amazingly fun, educational, challenging and satisfying. nearly infinite options for variation and replay. most importantly, now available for those of us using steam on linux. the only problem is that i lose days at a time when i play through the longer scenarios. definitely worth $30 and a steal when on sale.",78.9
"so addictive! its so difficult to save and put this game down...",521.4
"such a good game. have spend many days playing this and i love every bit of it. didnt like ghandis face, declared war on him and anhialated the indian race. 10/10",84.6
"i must warn you. this game is dangerous. dont buy this game if you have a family. dont buy this game if you need to go to work. dont buy this game if you need sleep. i failed everytime when i tried to quit. there are so many nations you could choose and each nation you need to fine tune your strategy to win the game. thats very interesting. not a single game is the same. the ai is good (though i think not as good as in civilization iv) and the interface is intuitive. the tutorial is quite helpful even a newcomer could enojy the game within minutes. i kept playing civilization iv until v was released. i think i will keep playing civilization v until vi is out.",519.3
"wow bought this a few days ago not expecting them to put this as a marquee sale but nonetheless it was worth the moeny for this and all of the extra content. this is an amazing game, veterans may think its dumbed down but in truth, 4 needed a cutting of the fat, this streamlined the gameplay to a point of a very well balanced game that is not only fun to play in, but challenging still. this game is amazing and you should buy it while its this cheap. do yourself the favor!",31.4
"i love this game! i am a huge history nut and being able to relieve great parts from history as great leaders was real good fun. i have the base civ 5 game & looking into getting the complete edition which incl. all dlcs and scenarios. this is the best game out of the civ. franchise by far! great fun & i cannot wait to play it with friends.",7.1
"this game is addicting. would be the 4 words that i would say if somebody asked me about this game. civilization v is probably the most fun ive had in a game. every turn, you move your units, manage your cities, interact with other civilizations, not knowing what awaits you next turn. you can become friends with the warmongering genghis khan, or piss off the peace loving gandhi. this game offers a ton of civs to play as, so youll be spending alot of time in it. also, if youre worried about getting demolished, dont worry, civ v offers a really good indepth tutorial made for getting beginners into the game. if you can get a good deal on this game or the ultimate edition, i really would recommend buying it, and prepare for getting your soul sucked in. 9/10.",343.3
"i pretty sure 90% of the hours ive put in have been on one single game... unit stacking needs to come back but besides that highly recommend.",64.1
"this game is great for people of all ages i highly recormend it and all the expansions",234.7

"brilliant game a++ really addictive build an empire and deestroy the world!!",25.2
"dont ever play this if you have work the next morning or an important assignment soon.",119.5
"a fabulous game that carries on the civilization zeal for complex games that you dont mind spending days and days playing, yet never feel disgruntled at the prospect of starting over with a new civilzation, quite the opposite in fact. i relish the thought of starting a new game with a new map and perhaps a civilization ive never played just to see how it fares. civ 5 is a must for any civilization franchise fan, and equally recommended for anyone looking to break in to the genere of turn based strategy games. like a board game but prettier, and you dont have to hope the cat doesnt destroy it when you walk away. get civilization 5 asap, you are missing out!",162.1
"as a single player game: magnificent and flawless but multiplayer experience is horrendous. disconnections start after 20-30 turns, especially youre playing with more than 4-5 people. sometimes nothing happens, then suddenly game goes boom, and when you try reloading your latest save, half of the players cant even join to the lobby. it was a real ordeal on my part. stay away from multiplayer tab unless all players have top-notch crystal-clean connections.",139.5
"i got sid meiers civilization v a bit ago and i have to say that it is probably the best game i have ever played! it has hours upon hours of singleplayer gameplay, hotseat and multiplayer. it also has one of the greatest selection of mods to choose from with the downside that some may require a dlc which is fine since the dlcs themselves are a great and worthwile purchase. 9.5/10",139.0
"all countries hate me for being aggressive except the iroquois...so at least i have that going for me would buy again.",26.8
"its really addicting and fun but the matches are very long and its easy to start losing interest after while. still very enjoyable though.",68.7
"the civilization series is one of the best series ever. great diversity, great slighty changing ais, great gameplay all makes for hours and hours of re-playability. plus ghandi will try to nuke you!",265.7
"a thinking mans game. plenty of options for winning with different play styles and pregenerated leaders/characters to experiment with, very enjoyably time consuming!",484.6
"such a good game.. probably need time off work to play this so get ready call in sick.. i tend to keep restarting the game so many times until i get the right peice of land.. thinking about it iv prob spent more time restarting the map..",246.9
"best co-op strategy game ive played in-- well, forever. hours of gameplay are in store for you, so dont think youll have something as short as a one or two hour round. go big or go home; you either play a ten hour game, or you dont play at all. oh, and one more thing: dont trust ghandi. ever.",164.2

"amazing game, already 400 hours logged and i havent had it a year. tremedous replay value. can`t wait for beyond earth.",587.8
"this game is one of the best strategy games ive seen in a long time. if you are a fan of turn-based strategy games, this should be on your top 5 list. the game is challenging, but you can still conquer any task that is brought to you. 10/10 warning: may fracture fingers due to inability to put down the mouse",232.5
"i was not a big fan of civ 5 when i first tried it out. the game seemed slow paced and boring. however; after putting in over 300 hours i must say this is one my favorite games to date.",463.5
"civilizations enthralling gameplay captures even the most pedantic gamers taste. the many various ways of developing your civ make the game so compelling to play. it never gets boring and monotonous. well it depends on ones individual preferences but civ 5 will always have a special place in my heart. =)",42.7
"i start a match and figure out im playing with poland, manage to piss him off by taking a city state, he founds a city near my capital, i wage war on him and i seise control of that city, he declares peace giving me one of his city states, i dont give a , go to his capital and destroy it in 2 turns. then i go to venice and i nuke the  out of him gaining a dominion victory. i just realised i played 30 hours in about 4 days. 20/10 for ruining my life",76.2

"named my religion the d and everyone wanted it. 10/10",343.2
"civ 5 is a great game with lots of gameplay in it. you can easily play this game for hours without getting bored, especially with the complete edition which gives you loads of civilizations. the workshop is also a great way to extend your gametime. if you like turn-based tactical games, this will be right in your alley.",14.5
"the father of turn based strategy games. best installment yet.",76.6
"strategy games have has a large area in my heart, keeping me locked with them, this is just another good game, by the best strategy maker sid meier! he is a good strategy maker, in my eyes, since i have most of his games, and i still want moar. i recommend this to you, because its a fine game, long game sessions, but its calm, relaxing, and a true time spender.",102.8
"best strategy game. so many options, multiplayer, great graphics, mods etc. expensive dlc though. 9.5/10",71.2
"i highly recommend this game as a very relaxed strategy game. personally, i dont fare well with strategy games, but with 9 different ai levels, there is something for every type of player.",94.8
"after putting in over 100 hours into this game, i can unequivocally say it is not as good as civilization iv and sid should be embarassed the way he has fallen into putting out a half finished game and then over charging for expansions to add what should have been in the original release all along. not to mention the ill concieved combat changes and so forth.",110.2
"barbarian invaded my sheep, they started to smoke best game 10/10 would recommend.",877.7
"awesome game. really good civ game, it has a lot of better stuff then the other civ games. just a lot different in the start, but you get used to it and will enjoy it if you liked the other civ games",56.8
"simply, there are better games out there. the fact that metacritic believes it to be the greatest strategy game of all time is insulting. the ai are bad, the multiplayer is broken, and frankly i just find there to be a lack of content. a big company releasing so little, you really get the impression they are money grabbing. by far, paradox interactive are my favourite game devs. their games deserve the title of greatest strategy. if you are easily satisfied then get this game. if you are mature and enjoy a challenge with many times more indepth content, then get eu4, ck2 or hoi3. thats what i think.",25.9
"ive spent a great deal of time playing this game with a variety of strategies and i would say it is 100% worth it. although it can start out slow it picks up relatively quickly.",938.4
"one of the best strategy games ever. its so easy to lose track of time and get sucked into this game for hours and hours.",413.0

"thank god for optional difficulty in single player. if you enjoy envying your friends success during online games until rage overtakes your soul and you want nothing more than to watch everything your friends have worked for burn and become nothing but dirt, blood, and . while they angrily beg you for negotiations. then you will love it. 10/10: would ruin more friendships over.",197.1
"i have a hard time not falling into the same path everytime with this game>start civ with goal>abandon goal for shiny wonders>lose to other civ due to lack of ingame points. but, ive spent a lot of hours doing that same exact thing whilst having fun, so this game must be doing something right. 9.5/10",212.4
"this game is so good i had no time for a job and there so i quit my job. i soon ran out of money so i had to sell my house to aford the wi-fi. little did i know you have to have a house for wifi so i bought a car and parked outside of mcdonalds for their wifi until they kicked me out of the lot and i moved to a diffrent mcdonalds everytime until i had to sell my car for gas money. little did i know you have to have a car to get gas. so here i was with my laptop and a couple of moneys so i started walking to starbucks and playing there. soon i got hungry and had to use my gas money to buy food i soon ran out of money so i started to sell my belongings and eventraly selling all of my clothes. little did i know you need clothes to be in starbucks. i was kicked out. now here i am behind starbucks hiding in the dumpster writing this review. please buy this game!!!",53.2
"this is a game in a series that honestly does not need a review, and i personally feel that anything i say cannont do it enough justice. after many many hours put into this game this never seems to get old. the core gameplay is amazing, also that is open to moders is another large boost factor.",56.7
"pretty addicting game but its definitely not optimized. it uses like a gig of ram just on the main menu and loading times are crazy even on decent computers. content-wise its really great though. beat deity mode in 2 minutes, could use some balance. culture mode = challenge mode. some civs are better than others. religion rush op. id say 8/10 actual gameplay, 7/10 overall because of experience in loading screen and ram issues",114.1
"this game is fun. i like to build a gret nation to take over the world. i build mummies and zombies and no one can touch. i would recommend this game to child or adults. all races and black people.",132.4

"love this game so much, its good in short bursts and long play times... extremely long in some cases (spent 6 hours straight on it lol) it really makes you think of strategies to develop your civilization and more",13.7
"this game really addictive you can even build the great wall of america and the statue of liberty in india by the way dont trust ghandi",81.7
"amazing game, extremely fun specially with friends. only glitch that bothers me is the multiplayer modify and accept without other person receiving counter-offer glitch. 9.9/10 because of said glitch.",421.8
"basically this is all i have to say. the game is great,the units are awesome, and the small cutscences when you meet a new civ are amazing. i highly recomand this game to those who are a fan of the civ series and those who are a fan of strategy. so whats my rating for this? 1010 one eyed dragon approved.",51.7
"10/10 beware ghandi the all consuming destroyer of worlds",92.5
"not a leaping improvement on civ iv, how can you even do that? what civ v does is take another look at it. beautiful gameplay and style. would recommend it not only to any civ fan, but to any strategy game fan. a must buy.",46.9
"why is the multiplayer so slow thats the only important part wow gj obama",46.7
"fantastic turn based based strategy game, the political aspect of the gameplay adds a lot of immersion to the experience, as your cunning and persuasiveness can lead to your victory. varied gamestyles and multiplayer makes these attributes stick out even more when having to interact with real players, wielding a higher level of understanding and reasoning. 8/10 might not appeal to many gamers genre interests.",40.0
"great game to any fan of xcom: enemy unknown and turned base games",162.5
"if youve ever wanted to have sex, this is probably the game for you",42.8
"really enjoy this game and if it could add a battle feature like total wars then i would say its perfect.",259.2
"hands down the best turn-based strategy game. you will come back over and over to this game. the nuances you will discover are incredible and make the game 150% replayable. just watch out because just one more turn will always end up four hours later wondering what time it is.",52.2
"its a civilization by sid meier what can i say? best strategy game out there, very recomended for playing with friends. - buy multiple copies of civ v - start a lan party - buy lots of snacks - first few hours building and expanding - then all out war - game over ghandi massacres everyone - cry - go home and realize a day has passed - cry some more",195.1
"civ 5 is a great game due to its : replay ability its variable play styles however its dlc is very expensive (this is a very vague review and if you are looking to buy the game i suggest read a few more detailed review)",65.1
"the best civilization of the series. realism, great graphics, beatiful interface and fantastic sound. extremely addicted. you can play lots of hours(12h or more) and not even notice. always something will desire to build, expand, sent, explore, discover etc. a few turns more....aaa!! lots of civilazations, lots of different cultures combined mastepiece with armies, science, religions and nations. for the lovers of strategy is a must have.",41.4

"great strategy game that lets you finally lets you take over the world with ethiopia",380.3
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played. i have loved all of the sid meiers games and this one is the best to me. the dlc would make this game entirely out of this world. the only game of this type i think could top this is distant worlds only because... micro managing rawr",97.1
"great fun but time consuming game that you will start playing the all of a suddenly it midnight",90.8
"i bought this game shortly after the start of this year, and already have over 300 hours in it. one of the most strategy intensive and well thought out games of al time.",391.3
"so before i got this game i think a had a tiny bit of a life, just hnging on by its fingernails. now, after playing it, that life has been thrown off a cliff, incinerated, and cut up into bite sized pieces. (that means i dont have a life for all those people who cant get what im saying)",43.8
"satisfyingly you can play a whole game of this masterpiece lose and then want to start a whole new game with new ambitions and goals.",75.5
"civilization v is an amazing game that provides all of my strategy-gaming needs. you get to pick from many different civilizations and build them up to win several different victories. it can be difficult when needed, or extremely easy when youre just playing to mess around. i recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy!",120.0

"kill gandhi, live another day. seriously,  gandhi.",117.5
"this game is one of the best... if not the best turn based strategy games out there... i have been big fan of civ 4... but now that i played civ 5 with all expansions (that brought a lot of fixes) i must say civ 5 is far better... espionage is fun, exploring, lot of different nations and ways of how to play... the game is fun and it is time sink for sure! but game has few downs: some bugs... and on harder playtroughs diplomacy becomes pain as its really easy to get on nerves of npcs and really hard to be good with them (that needs still fixing and balancing) and few ai fixes are needed too... not to mention how ai cheats a lot (having lot of money and being in minus with income, spawing extra military units etc...) only thing i havent tried out yet is multiplayer... but hope in time i will have fun with that too :) but anyway... really good game :)",449.7
"a game you can play and literally lose days at a time, then after 20 or so hours of gameplay and lose so its all been for nothing! fantastic game, if i ever get bored or have spare time on my hands, throw it on and watch the day disappear. easy enough to pick up as well, cant wait for next expansion..",81.2
"ing great game, better buy the complete edition and not be a bum like me.",87.5

"this is one of my favorite games. caution: extremly addicting.",617.8
"its an amazing game. the graphics are incredible. the actual running of the game is smooth, and it is a very strategic game. will you win by clture or domination? which civ will you play as? who will be your allies? my favourite steam game by a longshot",151.4

"so i dont have very many hours on this but let me tell you something this game is a game that you buy if you want to do nothing except this in your free time. this game is even better when you have a friend and you can just screw him over for the fun of it. 20/10 would buy again except i have no monies.",51.6

"this game has got to be one of the best turn based strategy games in the entire pc gaming universe. i recommend anyone to play this if they have time on their hands and like to have more strategy in gaming.",88.8
"not the greatest civ game i have played. not being able to stack units and the hexa-tiles sure makes things different from the previous games. you have to love civ to look past the flaws to enjoy all the beauty that is this game.",76.5

"excellent game. 10/10 great graphics and everything!",84.1
"this is one of my favorite games to play, the realistic physics engine and amusing themes cast this game into one of the most difficult and fun strategy games ive ever played, especially now that they have added monetary constraints, the community development is superb and the game is constantly being updated and patched.",96.5
"the best civ game yet and the dlc improves the vanilla version dramatically. the one thing that has always bothered me about th civilization series is the diplomatic side of the game is very basic and would love to see some more depth. i love the new hexagon map layout and the replayability of this game is excellent.",482.3
"a fun turn-based strategy game where you can build your empire and conquer the globe. its very easy to use and will suck the hours away if you arent careful. be careful in the tutorial though, you cant save.",50.8

"the civilization series is not a game, it is a lifestyle, so much to the extent that your involvement in it will socially segregate you from those who are not familiar with it. 10/10 would lose any sense of normality again.",614.9
"honestly one of the most addicting games ever!! dont play this before bed, or you will be up all night!!",40.8
"warning: only play this game when you have run out of series to watch. when there are no more movies on your wishlist. when youve played every game in your library. be sure to set multiple alarms at 3 hour intervals. for when you start this game, 12 hours will pass without you noticing. you will completely miss the sunset. and sunrise. and wonder why youre hungry again, seeing as you just ate a large pizza. when in fact that was about 9 hrs ago. if you dont mind the loss of time. and love building your own empires, this might just be the game for you.",137.3

"civilization 5 was the first sid meiers game i ever played, i dont know what to expect. i have loved every minute of civ5, its one of the the few games i can lose so very very badly and with a grin start again only to get nuked off the face of the planet by gandhi. i didnt see gandhi coming like at all. we were so cool with each other then boom nukes everywhere the horror. still have nightmares about it 20/10 everyone join the madness :d",402.9

"some would argue that civ v dumbed things down from civ iv. i would argue the opposite - iv had overcomplicated the genre, and i think v has brought back the accessibility of the franchise, whilst stepping up the graphics and ai. one of my favourite games.",757.1
"**** this game. **** its bull**** options that are bull**** and do bull**** things. you want to play with a friend? you want to start in the same general area as your friend? while on a team? against all the other ai? hahahahahaha nope! our options here at civ 5 are bull**** lying trash and we **** in your faces. enjoy never being able to have the game you want, thanks for the money. 138 hours of reloading the game to try and get a spawn with a friend anywhere close while the option start together is selected vs emporer bots. nope! because here at 2k sports its in the game! as long as it isnt an actual options menu that matters!!! eat butt.",241.3

"if you have 10+ hours that you are willing to spend on one round of a game then this is for you.",114.2
"play this game if you like micromanaging numbers and the feeling of success when your numbers are higher than your opponents. the only non-numbers thing is positioning (of cities and units). and i suppose diplomacy. the gameplay is very good though. it has a moderately steep learning curve, but once you understand the mechanics and learn the costs of everything you will start to think more strategically and thats when it becomes fun.",45.6
"love the game, the graphics, and gameplay. its easy to play and fun. i give it a 5 star rating and a 10/10. anyone who loves strategy games will love this.",32.6
"really fun game. only downside is that it sucks your life away with all the hours put into it.",22.8
"while the game gets a little bit repetitive in its gameplay over time, every playthrough is different enough to keep players interested. the game is challenging, fun, and captivating. it is also highly, highly addictive. the dlcs really add to the gameplay, but the game is still fun without them. highly reccomended, 8.5/10.",41.2
"this game is great. i love the gameplay and the combat style. the only complaint i have is how expensive the dlc is.",22.5
"this is the first civilization game i have played, so it took a solid 45 minutes to learn how to play the game effeciently, but it is worth it because the game is a lot of fun. if you can get past that initial 45 minutes - 1 hour of learning the ins and outs of the game, you will love playing it.",86.8
"any one up for 12h+ game? maybe? that said, great game! your best bet is to wait till there is a summer / winter sale to buy the games and dlcs (cheaper 75%) . and as always, watchout for gandhi...",308.9
"feels like i used a time machine when i play.. that can only be good right ?",32.5
"...just... one... more... button... this game is epic! well worth the purchase (esp on sale day)! i strongly suggest you get the expansions as they add great elements to the game, as well as some common sense fixes to technology and military progression. ranged/melee ships become available throughout the game. archers can upgrade throughout the game. iron isnt necessary for early seige units. just some really great stuff that makes your gaming experience all the more pleasureable... just... press that button one more time... and watch your days disappear 10/10",677.8

"i never played this series before civilization revolution for the xbox360 and at the time i found the game a little underwhelming. i saw this come out and i immediately fell in love with it! it has enough complexity for those with strategies and yet it doesnt fully require you to take advantage of said complexity to win a game...",110.8
"what the hell are you doing!? stop reading my review and go get nuked by ghandi!!!",171.8
"this is going to be a very biased opinion because i love this game! choose your nation and make them into the greatest faction the world has ever known. you can start in ancient or modern eras and pursue one or all of an array of victory conditions. one of the best turn based strategy games around. multiple ways to attain victory. crush your enemies with a powerful military, pursue peace with culture and diplomacy, or choose to study the sciences and who knows what you may uncover. +several leaders to select from +great gameplay +plenty of maps +multiple victory conditions +you can go about the game in many different ways",85.2

"i have always been a fan of civilization and this is the best one so far. it sucks they only added religion through dlc but atleast its there. this is definitly a fun strategy game with some serious replay. multiplayer has always been my focus when dealing with civ. the multiplayer is fantastic and i have spent countless hours struggling against my friends and others online. the base game itself was weaker than i wanted it to be but with the addition of the major dlcs such as brave new world there has been much added to the game that makes it feel whole.",127.4
"this game is great, but to get the full experience the brave new world expansion is a must have at this point. i have stacked almost 50 hours into the game and just now started playing on prince difficulty. ive had the most fun playing while drinking with some buds. 10/10",57.6
"this game is as close to time travel to the future as is currently possible by mankind. you start playing, and five minutes later you realize that, for everyone else, two hours had passed.",132.2
"so much fun. addictive and educational. yep i said it. learn bits of history witht he vanilla setup of the game. learn how leaders like gnadhi n such were. anyways its a great turn based strategy with a indepth game and great military units. shame i never have time b4 conquering the world to make buildings in citys so much",146.4
"with the 2 major expansions civ v has risen its complexity to finally stand up to civ iv with its rich gameplay. and since brave new world was patched to fix the balance of world congress diplomacy, culture influence and turism, the fans can at last consider picking civ v as their favorite civilization game of all time. its so good in fact, that despite over 650 hours of playing, it continues to give me a bad case of the just 1 more turn syndrome. dont come close to this game if you still want to have a life.",795.1

"a friend had told me about civilization for a while now, and i finally decided to pick it up during the summer sale. glad i did! civ is an awesome game so far and i literally instantly got hooked on it the first time i played. multiplayer is amazing so far even with just playing with one friend. awesome game!",140.6
"buy. this. game. i have over 400 hours invested into this game and it has not gotten boring yet. make sure you get the downloadable content with it. it makes a huge difference and brings all new and exciting ways to play to the table. you have to be careful when playing this game because you will start playing and bam next thing you know you have been playing for 6 hours straight. one of the best games i have ever bought. there is one con to this game. when playing online make sure you try and play with all human players so there are few or no ais playing with you. this is because for some reason the ais wont declare war on anyone while it is in online mode. they will in single player, just not online. honestly that is the only negative thing i have found about this game. word of advice, the zulus are s and mahatma gandhi is an even bigger . 9.5/10",431.4

"civilization is one of those games that will never get old. for strategy fans this game is a must-have, and with all of the maps, civilizations, steam workshop items, and competitive multiplayer, this game will continue to suck up all of your freetime for years to come. civlilization 5 is easily one of the best strategy games that i have ever played (its up there with the original supreme commander and sins of a solar empire). i dont know how many times i have watched the sun set, loaded up a new game of civ, finish the game, and then stand up and strech while i watch the sun rise. i have discovered very few bugs/glitches, and really dont have anything bad to say about this game. easily 10/10 for me.",465.9

"never thought id get into a game like this but now im addicted!",54.3
"civ 5 is very much differnt then the other civs in many smalls ways which makes it a big way. i personally love this game, its hard to seige a castle, but its not impossible, and can even be easy if you know how to do it. it can be as easy or as complicated as you want. as easy because it can all be done automatic and all you need to do is watch, to as complicated because you can micro manage everything, including where your citizens work. civ 5 has a play style for everyone who likes turn based simulations. from dominating everyone, to being the best in a curtain amount of time, to being great friends with everyone. i strongly recommend this game, and as a hint to winning. pick a way of winning and stick to it. there are many ways to win, and if you stick with one, you will win.",251.7
"this game is really good. it puts you in place of a ruler and lets you build a civilisation from scratch. its a great experiece and can even be educational. 9/10 ps very addictive approach with caution",87.5
"just buy it if you havent, worth the money. get the expansions aswell, theyre amazing. as in the game itself, you spend countless hours with different civilzations that you can play as on different kinds of maps that you choose. theres a lot of types of victory; being science, culture, diplomatic, dominance, etc. theres different eras you progress through and with science you get new buildings, units, etc. i have spent a lot of hours into this game and im still not bored of it.",176.9

"its great for experimenting with civs by your self, but even better when you go up against friends.",140.2
"warning: this game has a tendency to try and consume your life. i must say i try to only play this game occasionally, reason being it sucks you in and doesnt let go, i have passed the 390 hour mark and still find myself saying just one more turn. if you like this type of strategy game you will not be disappointed and will gain a massive time sink in your life, p.s, dont trust ghandi!",477.6

"an absolute must-have for any pc gamer. its easy to get into, while at the same time has a great degree of complexity. it has infinite replayability and can be a massive time sink. the base game is solid, but make sure to get at least the gods and kings expansion for a better experience.",157.2

"civ v. awesome and addicting game, nuff said. 10/10",52.7
"this game is extremely addicting and fun a must buy",108.9
"now, this game is amazing...of course youre gonna need the dlc brave new world to get the full experiance that you should have, which the gold edition does include for cheaper. i bought the gold edition whenever it was out for sale that had took off a lot of the price. personally, i would wait for it to go on another sale to get it because it is a pretty high price without the sale. so, overall i would say it would get a 4/5 star rating with brave new world, base game on only 2.5/5. it just doesnt have a good enough amount of game with it. so, yes i would definitley reccomend this game to anyone looking for an amazing 4x game they can play with friends or solo.",20.6
"civilization, what is to say? even metascore gave it a 90/100, the civilization franchise is a wildly popular one for good reason, the interactive aspects of every idea, good connections to history, and the possibilities of what you can do, these all lead the a good times both alone, or with friends, the two big dlc of this game, gods and kings, and brave new world offer alot of new things never really expanded on before, such as spying on other civilizations, starting a religion, and more, all in all, i support the civilization series through and through",149.7
"civ 5 is a very interdependent game copying the phyics from go go ninja boreo. each of these games consist of one of the players using their fedoras to seduce their enemies untill loving them to a point where one cant love anymore.",3.2
"absolutely fantastic civ game. totally recommend if you are a fan of the series.",73.4
"i dont play this game often but when i do its for hours. the tile system does add an extra level to the tactics of war. however, on the easy settings you can just buldoze the ai. on the hard settings the ai can just buldoze you. i enjoy playing mods now that i have quite a bit of playtime in. being able to play with a new research tree(s) makes this a game you can replay over the years.",722.8

"this game is truly amazing especially if u get the complete edition. you basically manage an entire country u built up from nothing and makhere are make it a global superpower. there are countless countries to play as as many custom governments u can create (the custom government thing is only in the complete edition and brave new world). you can declare war on countries and maybye take over the world if u want. also this game has a very complex political system that is great for negotiating complex deals. there are 5 ways to win th game whicheach are all funt try out. this game will give you months of entertainment. 10/10 amazing game",74.0

"definitely a good game. though, if youre not getting the complete edition dont buy. definitely not worth buying if youre only going to get the base game. the dlc and expansions really form the game. on to the checks! steam workshop? double check. replayability? double check. friend friendly? eh. its to your liking. insomniac gameplay? eh. but some games take forever. be warned. pc must-have? check",52.6

"a great turn-based strategy game where you lead your chosen civilization to victory. it plays kind of like a giant board game that manages to be deep and engaging without getting too complicated. it can be a bit overwhelming at first, but after one or two games against the ai youll understand everything about the game. oh, and get the dlc. the base game is just alright, but the gods and kings and brave new world dlc make it so much better.",168.9
"takes a really long time to play, but its pretty worth it if youve got some friends to play it with.",34.8

"my god, sid meier, you have outdone yourself. this game is the best in strategy that ive played, and widely multiplayer for those of you looking for a game to play with friends. the price is definitely worth paying; despite the thirty usd price, or sixty for the bundle, this game is full of things you can do. for those who like war games or even just building a city, this game is for you.",13.6
"i love this game, it is a great game, but civ 4 was better and more complex, this is easier than civ 4 and the ai does need alot of work considering its backstabing and the ability to not make true longlasting friends with the ai as a ally.",660.9

"if you play with friends this game will destroy your friendship 10/10",177.5
"a whole lot better than the other civs ive played. but why they cant live up to their old game alpha centauri is beyond me. so im being unfair and judging it purely on that. and why is iron so much rarer than uranium? come on, game.",23.2

"my lord yimotep, this game has half my hours on steam, :d",434.3
"this game may literaly be my favorite turn based stratagy and i play it more than any of my other games on here or on my xbox/ps4. i like this game because its so interactive, you can just get so into andaddicted to this game in such a short amount of time. what i dislike is how the dlc is lik $30 thats silly that just as much as the game costs maybe even more than the game but they are worth it nontheless.",243.1
"over the course of the last week i managed to play for one day. the rest of the time the game refused to start. i tried everything from driver updates to windows updates, from restarting steam to rebooting the whole machine... but no, the game doesnt work correctly anymore. there also seems to be alot of people who also have that problem, while others dont. i dunno why that is so and i dont care. if its an error with the program itself, they have to fix it. if its an issue with steam, they have to work wit valve to fix it. since its pretty much gambling wether you can start the game or not, if you dont have the game yet, i would say save your money. also the last civ ill buy for the next years, since i dont trust them to do better with the next one.",256.1
"highly addicitve. a must buy game for all. probaly the hardest game to stop playing once you have started. 10/10",125.7
"i founded new berlin right on top of where modern day edinburgh sits today. we built such wonders - the brandenberg gate (naturally), the leaning tower of pisa, big ben... we even built the great wall of china right across hadrians wall. people loved that city and came from miles around to marvel at its majesty. great men were born - rommel and alan turing, marching arm and arm across the rooftops of the world. at one point one of my famous playwrites even penned the fabulous wizard of oz. but then, just as we were on the cupse of the atomic age... the manhatten project poised to usher in a burning nuclear dawn over the south of england (and a unit of stone age archers id left forgotten down there), i was confusingly defeated by a random vote at the un which appointed my hapless opponent as world leader. game over.",157.5
"so addicting... starting to even like it more than civ 3. its sad you cant stack troops though.",68.8
"great game, owned the x-box civ revolution first but this version is much better and more in depth. have had lots of fun playing by myself, and with friends. the hotseat multiplayer can be lots of fun!",78.0
"awesome game. good for all difficulty levels and easy to learn.",59.2

"absolutely amazing game and well worth buying. great fun and very involved. multiplayer could use some tuning though.",134.6
"as a bad rts player, i recommend civilization as it is turn-based ;). anyway, the nation you guide in the game, organized in cities, has a very deep but easily approachable management system, and advancing through the game is very satisfactory.",34.9
"one of the best strategy games i have ever played. dlc makes it even better but still great without",210.5
"its the best strategy game on pc! after the first game you will not to be able to live with out it!!!",222.0

"you make your own civilization and you destroy other civilizations and stuff happens and its fun. 15/10",125.2
"its civilization, the latest edition. the civ ais all seem pretty similar, and politics means jack. expect every world leader (except maybe one or two) to constantly lie to you. they will form a city near you, then complain to you that youre building cities to close to their territory. the politics actually reminds me a lot of alpha centauri. just expect a fight, constantly. get as many of the city states on your side as possible, its the best way to stay ahead. i did manage to surround germany with submarines while i was poland and constantly lied about not worrying about the buildup of troops near the borders. felt a little poetic when i just invaded because i felt like it.",27.3
"this game can literally turn your 10 minutes, into 2 hours without you knowing it. absolutely recommended, assuming you can repel the just one more turn spell of this game.",12.8
"in a world where gandhi nukes you and atilla the hun sells you crabs, there are no downsides. 10/10",89.6
"this is a great game. definitely the greatest single player turn based strategy game out there. everything is polished and the ai is memorable. brave new world is without comparison. every person who plays it loves it. non gamers can get into it, and realize how much fun it is. i recommend this to anyone. (with the brave new world expansion of course).",819.2
"one of my top 5 favorite games of all time. highest levels are always challenging. 10/10.",281.1
"have you ever felt like becoming an emporer of your very own nation, then civ 5 is the game for you. its got depth yet is simple. its got no story but has endless replay value. it is one of the enjoyable games ive ever played. friendly tip though, kill ganhdi as soon as possible. hes a   who betrays you after having a 2000 year old alliance. ing ganhdi!",251.6
"this is a very fun and entertaining game that i highly recommend. civ 5 has almost infinate replay value with a whole new experience every play through. i do admit though, the ai in the game can be a little wierd at times, but it is always amussing to see a leader like gahndi become a dictator and attempt to conquer the world. so in conclusion, i would hghly recommend this game for any person that finds turn-based strategy games interesting and fun.",365.1
"this game is addicting, the only thing i wish they would fix is increased movement and range as you advance through the ages",243.9
"my 100 hours cannot even explain how amazing this game is. if you love expanding, creating militaries, and ruling the world, then this is your game. i love the dynamic relationship process, it works almost like real life. the system can teach you how real world politics can work sometimes, and no world is ever the same.",158.8
"great game, easy to sink hours into the game, unlimited fun",58.5
"i am writing this becasue i want a badge and feel socailly responsable to get it also i liked te game",44.2
"an addicting, turn-based game that will make the time fly as you build you empire from the ancient age to post-information age! nearly infinite replayability as mods, random continents, and nearly 50 different nations ensure a different game every time its played will you build a space ship? or coquer the world? trade and commerce? or found a utopia!",217.1

"unless you have to kill 8 hours a day at a job where you sit for a living, dont buy this addicting ing game",37.9
"the game heavily relies on strategy, and is not for the truly devoted. a game can take hours at a time, and it is absolutely fantastic!",15.6
"i have been playing this game since it was released, and i still love it. this game is a strategic wonderland. the graphics a great... but that isnt what makes this game great. this game is great becase of the great thought put into the game and its mechanics. its balanced well and has great diplomacy and war mechanics.",203.0
"sid meiers civilization v can be summed up in one word: addicting. this game is so exhilarating and i find it extremely difficult to pull myself away from it. dont plan on playing for an hour or less or even before you go to bed, it wont happen.",131.5
"i picked up civ v complete during the recent summer sale. while a decent game in and of itself, honestly it makes me want to load up civ iv again for a superior experience. if you have civ iv and beyond the sword... just stick with what you have, its better. if not, then civ v is a worthy game in the franchise.",102.7
"whats there to say? its civilization, and personally id say its the best of the main series (only overshadowed by, for example, alpha centauri or call to power 2).",486.7
"this game is extremely addictive. the interface is easy to use and the game has an excellent tutorial system, which doesnt get in ones face too much. if youre a fan of strategy videogames or settlers of catan, i highly recommend this.",119.9
"while im sure many of you already own this game, i would absolutely reccomend it to anyone whos a fan of turn-based strategy. while i feel many of the aspects of civ iv were toned down in complexity, i feel like the much more strategic combat helps the experience significantly.",315.1
"buy civilisation v, make sid meier rich, he deserves some money, hes a poor man living under the bridge and suffering from the financial crisis. please help him buying his magnificent game. you win twice: on the one hand, you got this game, which will fulfil any world domination urges youve ever had and secondly, most closely to that demand, you can feel the sun rising in your heart because you helped sid meier from starving and even helped him getting a new home! how can one be so cruel to hisself, the health of his soul, and deny a man the hand he needs in his most desperate hour. so not buying this game would constitute a crime.",237.1

"awesome turn based strategy game, not very demanding and looks beautiful. i really recommend it! ghandi is love ghandi is life.",57.4
"this is a great game with depth and different playstyles to suit your mood. however, there is a bug that makes your workers forget their assigned task and ask for a new one every round. this becomes tedious after a while and takes lot of time and clicks that could have been better spendt doing more exiting stuff. if you are going to buy this game you should check if they have fixed this bug first. i bought the game summer 2014.",707.2

"great strategy game. everything in the game works so smoothly and each race has its ups and downs to make the game interesting.",70.3
"greatest game in its series, same type of units can not on the same tile, that must use more strategy to win a battle or development. if someone found crash when play on windows 8.1, just choose play with directx 10,11.",244.2

"sid meiers civilization v is a turn based strategy game. you build an empire starting in the ancient era, and continuing on to the information era. how you play is entirely up to you. there are many different paths to take. you may choose to be a war mongering nation and dominate the world through military strength; you may choose to study the sciences and build a rocket to take your civilisation to a new world; you may choose to influence all civilisations with your culture and create a utopia; or you may choose to win diplomatically by becoming the leader of the united nations. in the gods and kings expansion pack you may choose or create a religion for your empire, where you gain your specified bonuses from it and are able to spread it through missionaries and prophets. its hard at first, but gets better after some practice.",356.6
"this game was great. 9/10 at least. if you dont like slow games dont try this one and if you think youll like it, and you want the expanion packs, get comlpete edition. saved me like $60.",50.3

"one of those games thatll turn 5 minutes into 5 hours and will have you always questioning what ghandi is really doing and dead certain that songhai will always betray you. its easiest to just wipe them all out. always go for the overlord victory.",171.4
"one of my favorite games of all time. i have loved the franchise since i first started playing civ 3, and have not found another love since. it is one of the best strategy games of all time, and with additions of brave new world it has become and even more accurate representation of the world.",678.5
"a great game to test your strategy and political capabilities. there are some mechanics in the game that i disagree with and feel that ruin the immersion a little, however it is overall a great game. i also originally disliked the decision to switch over to a hex system, however it is something i have adjusted to and now, even like. now if only i could stack my armies of units onto the same space like the older ones :)",45.6
"good strategetic game wished for more action like age of empires or mythology so faster war and results.",62.2
"i enjoy the game. but i cannot get any tech support from steam. now when i try to start the game i get an immediate steam error: missing executable. i have followed the suggested guideline for correcting this, but it did not work. i have e-mailed steam twice and have waited 5 days since my first call for help. i would appreciate some type of assistance with this.. if onw cannot acquire tech suppport, i guess you need to consdier whether you should purchase games from steam. if anyone can asssist me pleas send email to",588.3
"got raided by barbarians, got to silence attilla the hun, removed england from this universe, nuked gandi back to the stone age, i recommend this game",65.1
"just like all the rest of the civ series this is an amazing and addictive game. new dlcs give you the ability to host a wold council and make global decision. this is probably their best game yet.",162.3
"hands down the best strategy game in existence. there is literally nothing wrong with it in any way, shape, or form, and it is superb. id say if you like games like halo wars, the total war series, or any military/war game, then you should get civ 5. and if you do, i strongly reccommend getting the dlc. best purchase ive ever made (just look at how long ive played it)!",63.8
"this game is full of opportunities to win in 5 different ways, its unlike any strategy game ive ever played. this is by far the best turn based strategy game i have ever played, plus it is a ton of fun to play with friends when you cant go over each others houses you can just play civ v from home with each other :d.",151.5
"i am a beginner with the civilization games and the strategy category in general, this game is so addicting it made me totally jumped right in. if you love simulation games and strategy games this would be the best of both worlds. if you also love history and culture, thats even better, because you get a lot of that, learn all the leaders names and stories to show off in front of your friends how much of a historian you are. oh, and last but not least, amazing soundtrack.",142.7

"this is the first civilization game that i have ever played and i was pleasantly surprised. to put it short, it is amazing. a multitude of different play styles are supported and the variety of maps, game size, and online aspects make this game very replayable. the only gripe i have on the game is that units are not stackable, however that is very forgiveable when looking at everything this game does right. 9/10",37.1

"this is an awesome game. best civ since civ 2 gold edition",291.7
"great game to play with friends. the gods and kings and brave new world dlcs make the game that much better. get some pc gaming bros and buy this game with the dlcs. youll be entertained for hours. definitely a great lan party game, or a game to play solo to kill some time. not to mention the modding community is amazing. they come up with new civs and improvements. however, you cant use the mods during an internet multiplayer game. you can use them only in hotseat. dont let that detract from mulitplayer games, its still a lot of fun without them. 9.5/10 will build the pyramids of russia again. and again. and again.",240.0

"you get to piss your day away, but in a good sense. dont forget to invade all of the city states. 10/10, beware of gandhi.",30.8
"this is by far the most addictive game i have ever played. it is definitely beyond any other strategy game even though i like more the rts type. i ended up hating napoleon for always spawning huge armies right at my frontiers and ramses ii for finishing first all the damn wonders i had started to build 15 turns ago and cesar for cutting through all the weaker ones and charge my wonderful knights with tanks and mech infantry. ive never given ghandi a chance though. yet again, i cant stress enough on how addictive this game is, after sitting for ~6h (which seemed like 2h) i closed the computer only to start thinking how on earth am i to fight alone the alliance between the arabs and egiptians and beat a nuked up ramses to scientific victory. briliant game.",53.4
"the main reason i didnt reach my potential in school. 4/20 blaze it.",20.3
"i have owned this game for less than a year and have played it for almost 700 hours. i have literally given it an entire month of my life. every time i boot up civ, i briefly contemplate joining a support group. seriously though you should be able to relocate your capital. 10/10 would play for another month of my life.",1000.2

"support the rest of the world in dipolamtic victory, just a couple turns away, and then ghandi nukes the whole ing world into a nucler wasteland. ghandi nukes my cities, after killing my best friend stalin because i refuse to give him perals. then capture his capital city with a scout 10/10 for realism",18.1

"civilization is fun even for someone that might not want to dive into the numerous strategic approaches and play an easier more relaxed game. but after a while once youve gotten the hang of the game all you want to to is play for hours on end. its addicting, unique, and has lead the way for many other games (but none surpass civilizations epic game experience). i would recommend this game to everybody no matter what age or interest.",78.1
"civilization is one of the best games ive ever played.",180.1
"this game is absolutely fantastic. it will eat away hours and hours of your life, and you will love every second of it. it has awesome strategy elements and the turn based gameplay makes it more addicting than ever. its very deep, but beginners can still have a great time. not only is it my favorite pc game in recent times, its my favorite pc game ever. i highly recommend it to anyone. it is a phenomenal game.",194.7
"tried to be diplomatic, tried to unite to world as one, tried to bring peace to all humanity and usher in a golden age of knowledge and prosperity. i tried. really i did. but then ghandi declared war on me and turned everyone against me. i had to nuke everyone. now im the last civ standing. that was my first game of civ 5. tenoutaten.",179.2
"i dont know how anyone could release *this* and call it a finished product. multiplayer is just lagging piece of ...(your word here)! ive tried playing in 2 games with different people and on different host and both of them ended up in some horrible lag. netcode is so unfinished that i doubt that *this-piece-of* playable outside of lan. other than that game is decent, but failure to deliver and most importantly patch existing issues is so annoying that im not recommending this game to anyone who desires to play in multiplayer via internet with few peoples.",227.5

"once you pick up on all the game mechanics, it becomes a great and enjoyable way to pass the time. replayability is high due to the number of civilizations, game options, and random map generation, and playing with friends is very easy. i would definitely recommend buying at least the base game.",148.4
"best civilization by far, lots of fun to play. you can only play for so long before you eventually start to play less and less. its always fun though to pick it back up and try to conquer the world! 8/10",50.4

"fak everyone in this game. especially washington, ghengis khan and montezuma that .",37.5
"i have wasted countless hours of my life on this game, but it was definitely worth it.",44.4
"never been a fan of strategy games. i guess this was because id never really played them. my brother, who is very similar to me, told me to try out civ. im glad i did, because it now ranks in my top ten favorite games. if you are like me, and someone that comes from a first person background, give this a try.",69.1
"this game is a perfect play for any youtuber/streamer to do a long stream on. each game is around 6 hours long and is tense every minute of it. this game provides the player the perfect control over a country and grow it to the top. it is a turn based game that requires strategy all the time! you start out at around 3000 b.c. and play until everyone gets blown-up or until the 330th turn! rate out of 10: 8.9",344.7
"this is by far one of my favorite pc games of all time. the reason i think this game is so good is that it never really gets boring, there are so many mods for the game, and its so dynamic, its just really hard to get actually bored of this game. to top it off, it has great graphics, which in all honesty arent really required for a game like this. i might be a bit biassed of course since i love all of sid meiers games, but this one really takes the cake, i would recomend buying this game to all of my friends.",183.3
"this game is hours of fun! each expansion pack adds a new demension to the game making it even more fun. this game can make you easily forget that there is a world going on outside your computer room. the game is awesome to play with friends. best installment of the series thus far. endless fun.",316.1
"awesome game just dont know why i cant play direct x 11...",38.6
"sid meiers civilization v is a beautiful masterpiece of a game. the vanilla game alone is good, but when you see the number of things that you can download on the workshop or make yourself, it transforms it into an immense, content-packed game. there are mods to fix things, to add whole civilizations, to add maps, to completely overhaul the game itself, and many many more, and if those dont appeal to you, then with a few hours of using the sdk available, you can make your own scenarios, mods, and more. tl;dr:a brilliant game made so much better by the huge amount of content available.",485.2
"it is fun unless you playing against ing germany. ps dont buy on steam its 50$ less at eb games",96.9
"civilization v is must have game for people who enjoy strategy games. this game has combinations that will fit any person playing style. the basic things for this game are easy to learn. as you learn the more advanced items, your style will form to it and allow you to us it to the best of your abilities. for those who really like the past cilization games, you will like this one as well. and dont forget about the expandes, they take the gameplay to a whole new level.",284.8
"maybe just one more turn.... mmmm just one more. wait why is it 4 in the morning now.",115.2
"this might be one of the finest games ive played, and i dont get sick of it, even that i have played it a long time with no stop. mostly fun with friends, but also fun alone, since all the rounds you play are different. so this is a 9.5/10.",322.8
"a very good strategic game but requires a lot of patience and time. gripping adventure to conquer nations in peaceful or war ways. a must have for strategic awe.",9.3
"very addictive, 34 hours logged in 3 or 4 sessions. gandhi nuked me 10/10 would play again.",57.2
"probably one of the best games around. it isnt like age of emires where the whole job is to kill everyone, thats comes late in the game. you work with real world leaders, make alliances, and get some really mad and if you do decide to go fight a war, then be prepared to fight. i decided to try to take down egypt and that war lasted over a 1000 years in the end i just gave up and went back home.",114.9
"this game has been one of my favorites for quite a while, i mean whats not amazing about taking over the world? although it may get tiring after a while, it is an overall addicting game with great dlc, would definitely recommend this game to friends!",319.4
"<------ what ive been saying to rival city states.",115.9
"this game is absolutely great. the best turn based game ive played",37.6
"great strategy game, dare i say unparralled. the hex system is revolutionary and makes for a greater experience, especially in combat. the base game is great, but that said, i could never return to the base game after playing with the two gameplay expansions of gods and kings and brave new world. however, the base game allows for so many different experiences in itself, its still an amazing game on its own feet. the diplomacy is wonderful too, and the ai, especially as the difficulty is raised, react to every action taken by the player, whether it is a good-faith trade or the assembly of troops at the border. ive spent hours on end playing it and my only negative comment is that you cant play it if you have plans that night, because you will cancel those plans. enjoy.",402.0
"this game will destroy your marriage..... and you wont even care because you just need to go one more turn.",322.0
"who knew being a warmongering world superpower could be so fun?",498.2
"my first game took 24 hours. 24 hours for the aztec people to conquer the world... and then we went to space. deal with the historical and cultural anachronisms! they are probably one of the best parts of playing this game. solid strategy game, very large, a few different ways to play, music is good, and it runs well. 10/10 would nuke augustus caesar again.",38.7
"one of the best strategy games. so much stuff to do, to think about. this game look like anno or the settlers with turn base system. :)",6.3
"this game is interesting and can be fun, but the lack of any real kind of diplomacy leaves much to be desired. i found myself being frustrated by the game more than i enjoyed it which is unfortunate, the game has tremendous production values and solid presentation. i cant recommend this game as my friends have the same reservations as i do.",83.7
"one of the most time consuming games i have ever played. spent hours playing through the tutorial.",42.9
"i liked the game. though you have to like a game that takes time to play. :)",153.1
"remember what happens in a civ game stays in a civ game",376.9
"ive been playing civilization since civ3, and i am not disapointed at all with this game. great graphics, incredible tech tree, and the dlcs are some of the greatest add-ons yet. with great modding allowed even, it just gets better. if you love turn based strats, you wont go wrong here. get it now, rule the world later",130.8
"i found this game to be super fun and rewarding. i cant wait to try out the multi-player. my only complaint with the game is with them using bismark instead of hitler, who is a lot more well known, and lets face it, was a more successful leader.",42.7
"you will not realize you put a week into this in one sitting until you die of thirst. yeah, its that addicting and absorbing.",53.9
"great game so differnt empires so many differnt so many ways to play your game could turn around with deal that was not thought through",60.4
"great game. a lot of hours you will spend in building, making war, diplomacy and management.",17.7
"die hard civilization fan here so the only thing i can complain about is the inflated price of the dlc packs, i really want the new brave new world dlc but 30 bucks for 1 dlc is kinda ridiculous especially with civ6 scheduled to be released next year. i already bought the game and all dlc available seperately, so i have already spent more on this game than the price of the combo. on top of that i didnt get some scenario games with some of the earlier dlc and a few of the civs, i tried steam and civ support and they each blamed the other and ended up giving up after fruitless hours of customer service. awesome game but the support sucks from steam.",506.9
"inmersive experience. makes hours fly. unleash your inner dictator :d",171.8
"this is by far one of the best turn based games ive played. whether its trying to get more delegates for the next world congress, warding npcs or other players off your borders, or fending off the all-too-many barbarians, theres always something to do, and it gets even better with friends.",131.4
"addicting i played 20 hours in one day it felt like 2 hours",34.0
"this is one of the best games out there right now. if youre going to get it i suggest bnw because its practically a new game. 200+ hours on this stradgey game is only the begining for me. this game is the best stradgey game ive ever played. civ 5 puts risk to shame!",259.3
"excellent game especially with the gods and kings dlc",228.5
"i would say a downgrade from what civilization iv was. the game seems more dull and repetitive. the price also has not gone down much but i guess that doesnt matter. one improvement to the game was the new hexagonal map and being able to culturally expand via gold and improvement of the production. i would say save your money an buy civilaztion iv though.",156.5
"as fun and addicted a civ game as ever. interface is very clean and streamlined. proudly continues the legacy of the series and will leave you awake in the wee hours of the morning muttering one more turn... to yourself. great game.",37.4
"i liked this game quite a bit in vanilla, but the replay value was a bit stale for my taste. the brave new world dlc has really beefed up the midgame, and offered a variety of new options that keep games fresh. still not sure it was worth $30, but grab it during a sale and you wont be disappointed.",294.6
"grand strategy at its finest without being too complicated. great fun alone or with friends and easy to pick up. just beware that its a time sapper. before ones knows whats happen 12 hours have past and the game still isnt finished.",91.2
"solid. fun. nuanced enough for tons of replayability.",662.4
"if youre a huge fan of the older civilization games you may be disappointed by the vast amount of changes they made in this installment of the series. i, however, loved all of the changes. the game feels sleeker, more streamlined and is just a lot more fun. whenever my friends and i start a game up together we find it hard to get off.",75.6
"you can kill gandhi 11/10 kony kush game of the year",178.6
"should i explain more on how great this game is? pros: -random map, different people, full replayability -tactical battle is always a plus -running a country has never been this accurate cons: -unrealism in the game, such as a city producing one thing and gandhi nukes me -i missed school for a few days after buying this game worth: i bought it for $49.99 so its $299.99 out of $49.99",27.4
"i love everything about this game except how to long it takes to get achievements.",259.2
"its a fun game. definitely sucks you in and you wont know how much time goes by when youre playing. if youre looking for something fast-paced this is not your game. if youre looking for a solid strategy game with tons of different playstyles then you should definitely try it out. the dlcs and mods also add quite a bit to the game if you get bored of vanilla.",590.7

"great game, just dont play it if you have something to do in the next 4-8 hours",561.3
"have an extra, oh i dont know, month or so to kill? civ v is about as in depth of a strategy game youll find, and by far one of the most fun. the 5th in the long line of great games, this one is worth the time, and the dlc.",522.2
"wonderful! the first hour you will just not understand nothing, but take your time and get comfertable with the game! just wonderful game!",46.2
"with both expansions installed, civ 5 finally becomes as complex as previous installments (they add religion, world congress, etc). ai still kind of sucks at combat, but otherwise its a great game that you can sink many hours into.",1063.9
"excelent game in the series, my favorite since call to power. the game complexity is such charming, and youll hardly find any comprehensive material about it. most of times, youll just need to learn on your own. hex tiles and non-stacking military units resulted in a very strategical militar combat planning, as opposed to the death stcks of the game predecessors. graphics are just gorgeous. sometimes you want to go to war just to watch some swords swinging. soundtracks as always are excelent and immersive. infinite city spawn is sadly still a problem, but much better than the other games in the series. recommended!",169.0
"civilization v is the latest game in a series which has spanned more than a decade. its cool, the games are downright awesome but most importantly, the game is fun. with the gold edition, the players gain the chance to play as one of over 34 different civilizations. whilst the games are lengthy, the idea of competeing against your friends and other ai in diplomatic and military solutions as well as economic, cultural and scientific all add to the joy. this game is the stratgy game. i strongly advise you to give it a go. its not complicated. and its not hard.",103.7
"a epic game! the game is hard and takes skill to play. if you lied games like master of orion, this game is like that just a different theme, based on human history, and more in depth. i have played countless hours of this game and do not understand the gripes with this game. civilization was made for gameplay not graphics. about the only gripe i do have is that the game does get kinda laggy as there are a lot of big civilizations, but it is not that big of a deal. this is because it takes longer for the computer to think about what moves to make. be prepared to spend many many hours playing civilization each game takes many hours to finish. but it is fun and addictive. i do not have the brave new world expansion, but those i know who do have it say it is great. i do however have gods and kings",170.8
"really good. best stradegy game i ever played (i havent really played any others)",9.2
"there is no reason not to own this game. have played lots of hours with the base game and all the expansions and even if i got tired of it there is a large moc community on the steam workshop.",452.1

"if you have any interest in strategy games, you probably already have it and a couple of its predecessors. otherwise, buy it and your only regret will be that the wife left you, got the house and the kids. but hey, chances are you wont notice anyway.",914.8
"didnt think it was possible, but a game that was arguably more simple than civ rev on consoles at launch has been transformed into a more than decent title (just make sure to pick up the expacs). the fact they they simplified so much after the most complex title (civ iv) imo was a shock to many, but rest assured that while this doesnt come close to paradox titles, theres enough to chew on for that one more turn feel to creep back into the game. 8/10 for taking years and years to get here, otherwise it would be a 10 like practically every other main civ title....now lets see rome ii pull this off, lol.",171.3
"one of the best game ever made you will never get bored of it becasue there are so many different things to do",343.9

"the best tactical game ever! yes, it takes a long time to play, but its totaly worth it. espesially fun with your friends!",149.2
"great game, have lots of fun playing this especially with friends, very good for a multiplayer strategy game however the number of dlc for extra nations is abit annoying but there are many nations you can add from the steam workshop, worth the money.",137.8

"how can i write a review if i dont own the game pls explain. 10/10",31.2

"if you love em you love em, if you hate em you hate em. they are what they are. civ v is no disappointment as a successor to the series.",237.1
"with the release of brave new world, the mecahincs of civ v finally feel reasonably streamlined. always something to build, lots of ways to achieve victory, and culture and tourism really feel like epic options to pursue. i would have to recommend getting both expansions to get the most comprehensive experience. the map and civ packs are also great additions, as each has radically different civs to try. theres a civ for every playstyle",107.6

"buy this game if you have nothing to live for and you want to ruin your life",63.0
"although ive never been one for rts, civiliztion v is just such a fun experience that i just could not put it down. its the kind of game you get lost in and find yourself playing long after youd think it would be time to stop. its a game that a person of any taste, whether it be someone whom enjoys awesome rts or maybe someone who just likes the experience of being a leader on the world stage, the experience is the same either way, truely amazing. with gameplay like this, its no wonder that the franchise civilization has been around so long yet stayed so relevant. i cant wait to try future installments.",73.4

"good game for every conspirator, war driven fanatic, or diplomatic peacekeeper. recommend to play with friends",22.4
"wow. civilization v. probably one of the funest games i have played. you need to make important decisions all through out the game. think simcity with combat, and much much much more. this game allows you to rule your very own empire. i suggest and recommend getting the complete edition because this includes so much more things to do, which makes the game play so much more detailed and dynamic. be warned. a standard game on this will take around 8 hours. this isnt a game you can simply pop onto and leave, it is extremely addictive and enjoyable!!! get this game if you love tactical games!",119.0

"this game is amazing! all the rewards it has gotten are well-deserved. i would read the full review on a website like ign or such, but if there is anything you can get out of my review, it is that you should buy this game. a perfect blend of in-depth building and strategizing, and fast-paced gameplay. with so many options to choose from, you really do choose your own path, again and again and again. with different gameplay options, many different factions to play as, infinite decisions to make and paths to travel down over and over, plus all of the mods and now steam workshop, you cannot go wrong with a purchase like this.",16.9

"i have already played this game for 5 hours and i started playing last night. your first game is going to be a bit tricky, because you have to learn all the symbols and figure out how to maneuver, but after a few hours it gets really fun. with some games, i would have already gotten bored, but there is so much content that i doubt i will ever be bored with this game.",9.5

"missing a few good old features from the 4rth, but still a really good game. some new features, like the 1 unit per case and the hexagonal format, are pretty great and change a lot of things when thinking about strategy. for thos who miss the religions, i also recommend the expansion, kings and god.",562.7

"not just a strategy game but it is an experience. you will lose yourself in the intrigue and strategy of this as you try and build your civilzation into the greatest on the planet. be you a warlord, diplomat, or economic savant, you can play your way and build a nation in your own image. do you have what it takes to build the greatest civilzation known to mankind? can you build a civilzation that withstands the tests of time?!",91.8

"i have decided to write this review, because i myself wasnt sure about buying, but reading reviews changed my mind. all i have to say that i was doubtful at first, but you learn this game pretty fast, but you master it pretty slowly. just one more turn.... and it is 2 am and i have to get up at 7 am, god... i hate and love this game at the same time. 10/10 would not sleep again.",362.2

"if you need a high quality time sink, this is a good game. the game isnt boring and is fairly easy to get the hang of. some turns require more thinking and some turns require less. when i first started playing, my ocd to be far more prevelent than in most game. some turns require more thinking and others require no thinking. this is something that is rough on simplier methods of managing ocd. i did manage in the long run. the linux port is top notch. full screen behaves way better than most games. graphics are nice but dont really matter much for this type of game.",157.8
"i simply love this game, every game is different and enjoyable, you can customize enough to make it pretty darn challenging or a sandbox laidback session. i def. recommend this. seriously. buy this game. play it.",173.8
"the single best strategy game i have ever played. sessions of this game take a while, but it keeps you enthralled and offers a lot of replay value due to dlc and a huge amount of characters to play. if you have ever enjoyed a strategy game, and have not already played this one, buy this game.",269.3
"i once went over to a freind of mines house at 9:00 am. i sat down at the desk next to him, grunted a hello, then loaded up civ v. his parents kicked me out around 11:00 at night. i proceeded to go home and play it for another few hours before passing out on my desk. woke up the next day with a migrane and an overheated laptop. all of my progress was gone. almost killed someone. game was pretty good btw.",154.0

"very fun games however each game (on fastest setting) will literally take 5-10 hours. on the marathon setting, expect over 24hr games. as a consequence, i havent played a single full game yet! (about 5 hrs) pros fun multiplayer + cons long games - gameplay= 8/10 graphics= 7/10 sound/audio= 5/10 multiplayer= 9/10 re-playability= 8/10 total= 36/50= try demo, if you like it, buy it! i payed 5 but its worth the 20!",20.7

"i have enjoyed the civilization series since the first game rolled out in the 1990s. although civilization iii and iv had some really great features, i do like the flexibility that civ v offers. the addition of religion as a victory standard is good. the traditional means of attaining victory are still there (cultural, science, conquest, diplomatic), so not much of a change there. i do like the hexigonal map base better than the squares of past civ installments., however, there are a few things that i do believe needs to be altered in the game. in civ iv, if your culture was dominant, it was possible to expand your borders through culture. this feature is missing. i would also like more freedom in using the spies, as was available in civ iv.",368.2
"good game, very fun to play with friends and others. but keep in mind the solo game isnt as fun as brave new world. so if your gonna get this game better get brave new world as well.",243.5
"civ v is a must-have game for any strategy game lover. it has everything they could want in a game. economy, military units, diplomacy, multiple victory conditions, different civilizations, and so on. the only thing lack luster in this game is the diplomacy. civilization games just never have had a stellar diplomacy engine. the a.i. has always been a little derpy but nothing that can be frustraiting. just dont be expecting help from allies, or many allies for that matter.",113.5
"if you enjoy strategy, youll love civ v. also, its probably the best turn-based strategy game around.",125.2
"yo these troops doin these things, in these places....damn",14.4

"whats not to say? this is a great game that i can keep coming back to when ive run out of games (read: money) to play.",163.6
"civ 5 is a great addition to the series. just like the other civ games, it plays exactly how you want it to play. for example, do you just want to conquer the world by destroying other entire civilizations with the strength of your army? do it. do you want to bring about world peace through culture or religion, avoiding physical conflict? do it! do you want to play some other way? what are you waiting for??? this game is a must for anyone who enjoys strategy games. the game is also like the other civ games in that the expansions just make it better. with the addition of religion, new races, etc. the gameplay seems dry without. just fyi. so if you are able to get the expansions, then i highly recommend it. but either way it is a welcomed game to the series and one of the must have strategy games imo. :d 9/10",89.9
"well, this is by far one of the most addicting games i have played. once you start a map, you keep telling yourself one more turn. the interface takes a little getting used to, and it requires a little bit of strategy, but you can automate a lot of stuff, or customize whatever you want with your civilization. i think the combat is a lot better than iv also. you are given a little information on what could result from the battle before actually fighting the unit. once you adjust to the interface, you will get hooked on this game. an absolute must play for any strategy gamer.",181.3
"well, its not a bad game at all when it comes to strategy. if you are a person who likes strategy games, this one is for you. however, it does require some patience when it comes to playing on multiplayer, because it is a turn-based game. this is also a really hard game because you need to monitor many things such as the number of citizens you have in a city, or how many turns are left until the next building is completed. actually, its not a bad thing because its a challenge to learn how to multi-task and monitor. in overall, its a challenging game that requires a lot of experience, but you can learn to do things all at once at most strategy games if you master this game.",9.9
"absolutely love the game!!!! first day i bought it i was like mehh then next day me and my friend play and we are like 6 hours into it and im hooked, and so now sincei bought it 3 days ago its been at 20 hours of play time",50.7

"very good for strategy lovers and generally a re.ally fun game",27.3
"before i started playing, i pictured this game as being kinda like rts games ive played like age of empires. this is more turn-based and strategic than other games, with an emphasis towards building up over a long period of time. and yeah, i mean looooong. games can get fairly lengthy, though its pretty easy to put them on pause, even in multiplayer. theres definitely a learning curve, and while the tutorials are adequate for the basics, theres a lot of nitty gritty stuff that trips you up the first few games. overall, this is a great game for turn-based strategy, with lots of replayability, especially if you can get a couple of friends to join you for a long evening session.",92.3
"i come from tons of hours on civilization iii and i was a little sospicious about this one... but i was wrong. this game balanced, tough and have a lot of new cool stuff. worth it.",91.2

"10/10 civ 5 is an addictive game of strategy... psshhh i really dont know much about games. but this one is really fun. its challenging, and there are so many different ways to win (although nothing really beats just killing everyone else off). if you feel like dominating the world, this is the game for you :)",115.6
"one of my favorite games of all times, it can be equally realistic and ridiculous and is a definite must buy! i have become a little obsessed with the game and i have hundreds of hours of playtime and have still only scratched the surface of what i can do, and what civs i can play as. you can spend hours developing strategies and plans for the ultimate empire, or just dont give a care and nuke everybody. in my time in civ i have been able to: -take over the world as the might warlord ghandi -get my butt kicked by siam within 20 turns -watch the babylonians burn after they dared to defile me -say that ill only play for 2 more turns and end up playing another 200",780.4

"one of the best games in the civ series in my opinion. the game has an excellent combination of strategy, and action (for those who love wars that is.) i would reccomend this game to just about anyone who really wants to play a challenging game, and for those who love strategy, its a must have. with the steam community being extremely active in the work-shop, the game has an abundant amount of mods available to change the gameplay. i give the game a 10/10, and would highly suggest you to buy it, if you dont already own it. itll remain the the game of my choice for years to come.",381.6

"amazing love it especially with friends such a treat to play",85.1
"this game is dangerously addictive. i really dont want to recommend this game but i have had some great moments whilst playing it. the early game is really engrossing. mid game a bit of a muddle late game a bit of a chore. but you will find that you consume yourself and your time learning the mechanics of the game only to discover that you are ultimately micro managing several sets of numbers. (hammers, beakers, etc..) trying to increase them bit by bit. 169.3 hour on civ 5 and that is nothing compared to others. life it too short for a game like this.",207.6
"very good game if you want to pass time like youre doctor who, golden pass more than worth the extra money. this is one of those games that youll play for a week then stop then later on in the sycle youll start again. once again a very good game to pass the time with praticly no effert.",356.8
"really enjoyed all the play time this game gives. i havent even touch online yet and im still having fun! some games take time but if you have time to speare then this is defently worth the buy. i run on a laptop and cant run alot of games but this has no problem providing a fun experence.",123.8

"really good game, great soundtrack, lots of in-depth options and creative maps. it feels like a classic board game like risk but with way more options. the only problem is that you cant really play a game in one sitting, since a normal game is already like 8 - 12 hours. the modding community is great, adding free and creative civilizations in the steam workshop. this is definitely one of the best pc games out there. if youre into stragedy games, play this!",26.3

"i consider this game the de-facto empire builder, im sure a lot of people will agree. my only complaint is to really enjoy the game, you should have its two expansions, gods and kings and brave new world. this two expansions add concepts to the game that it was lacking. the base game is still very good in its own right. the other dlc arent really important, they add more civs, map scripts and sceneros. any one who want to get in to strategy games, i can highly suggest this one, and people who play them a lot, i can also suggest it. once you get used to the easy to use ui, its as it sounds, easy to use.",270.3

"when i first began playing this game it felt as though the learning curve was huge! i definetly had fun playing it, but i had matches that lasted for hours and then i would lose without knowing why i lost. its worth picking up again, i would say, to learn how to play it better, but its definetly a time consuming game. i was never really familiar with the civilization games to begin with, so im sure that didnt help with the learning curve.",19.6
"this game is truly addicting, with many features and long term startegical thinking. it is my favorite in the series so far, due to the 6 sided grid system and the 1 unit per tile. this also has a lot better graphics than the other games you played, you think euiv is detailed? well then you havent seen civ5. this game is really good if you like building and improving, but it also packs other stuff like diplomacy and high startegy combat with units all over the place. the expansions add many new civs and other features, making the gameplay ever so challenging. the only downside of the game is that multiplayer is impossible without a group of friends, since the game can take very long. it is addictive so watch out. the graphics are both the pro and the con, you probably wont be able to fully enjoy it on a laptop 10/10",621.5

"the best turn-based strategy game ive played. deep, and every dlc pack adds enough to make it feel like a new game. well worth the price, especially when on sale!",138.7
"8.7/10 im civ fan since civ 4. civilization v has a huge potential and its easy to get addicted to one more turn. in this game is always something to do, but play at big map after 100 turns can make gameplay slow :( ... so play in bigger maps req more fast cpu and better graphic card. civilization v is the revolution? rather not, but its one of best games of last years.",78.4

"was neighbours with gandhi -- didnt get nuked! 10/10",180.9
"a classic revamped well, my last play of this game was civ2, so im jumping to this, no longer need to have roads everywhere, a more intuitive system, you can play many different ways with many different advantages. still this feels quite military based, almost forced, a great new and polished version of a classic. the simple view is a perfect idea for lower end computers too! speeds up gameplay alot. the addition of marathon mode is quite highly recommend to try, it really feels like you grow with your empire, then play a standard game and you can see how much you learn playing a very long game. i would recommend this for beginner to advanced players, it can suite the toughest, and the newest to gaming.",37.4
"this game is one of if not the best strategy games out there. the civ games have always been fun to play. the only thing you should do is give this game all the money.",286.6
"i can spend hours on this game, why? well its not just about winning battles to win but also about economics and developing your country with new developments you can do it.",416.3

"civ v was the very first game i ever bought on steam. best game of all time.",475.1
"first off, this game is amazing. you can sink so much time into this and just want to keep going for hours more. i would suggest getting the dlc as it expands on the game wonderfully. but my base review is that this game is definitely a buy.",320.7
"easily one of the best multiplayer games ive ever played. single player not rly my thing cuz it gets boring fast but the multiplay with friends is just pure awesomeness would recommend any time 10/10",103.0
"amazing game. especially with the expansions, it makes the game very deep and entertaining. but also, if you dont want a long game, you can select a time mode which allows a snappy but still entertaining game. as many other reviews say, dont play this game when you have only a short, or limited amount of time, because that next turn button is literally a magnet to your cursor.",395.5
"great game if you like strategies. (turned based) it focuses on choises that you make to help you (trade with this guy, attack this guy etc) 1 problem is that its not very fast paced... g2g faest.",76.2
"this is a very intesting game to learn more about the worlds history its self and create communitys and trade and even battle! i would totally recomend to buy this awesome game!",2.5
"if you want a time based, historical, and fun game, civ 5 is the game. with civilizations that have and atemped to stand the test of time, you can rewrite history and bring a new era of destruction and peace. play as many civs such as incas in gods in king and many more in bnw. i advice you to buy this with hopes you can enjoy it. i love it and i hope you all do to",530.6

"much awesome so amazing such strategy very fun lots game wow",143.9
"i cannot recommend this game enough.if youre into strategy games this is a must by, and its easy for beginners to get into.",262.5
"very good game. it is fun to play for hours, though it seems much simpler than previous versions. so it can quickly turn repetitive. the cure for that i have found to be spending few hours playing civ 4 or civ 3.",121.7
"this game is so good, there should be an civ anonymous group",433.8
"this game is one of those gems you can go back to after years of not playing and ask yourself...why did i ever stop?? must buy.",194.0
"this is an amazing game. ruling the world couldnt be more fun. has the option to play a more casual quick game, or a more hardcore long game (can take days to finish). great game. hours and hours of possible gameplay, and there are almost always good deals on it. buy it!!",106.0
"the best of the series! really an amazing game and worthy of just one moreturn!",151.7
"you might check the time and wonder if the last 12 hours of your life was worth it, it was! civ v is an amazing turn based strategy game that will entertain you for hours. try not to be too competitive when playing with friends though, it can get ugly!",298.4

"greater accessibility and refined combat mechanics vastly improve civilization, at little cost to the depth and complexity that has come to be expected. 9.6/10",146.3

"your people get extremely pissed if you build 2 cities, otherwise great game",83.6
"i cannot tell you how easy it is to get sucked into this game. look at the clock and realize youve been playing for hours on a single match. civ has always been the definition of turn based strategy games, and civ 5 holds true to that statement/ simply marvelous.",133.5
"one of the best turn base strategy games ever created. if youre into stategy games than this is a must!",543.4
"this game kicks major butt. i play it for hours and get lost in its amazingness. be any civilization from a wide array of choices and seize control of the world by whatever means you choose. its definitely a play the way you want game. i cant wait to get ahold of the dlc for this game.",48.0
"one of the best games i ever played o.o extremely addictive and hard which makes it a must-play!",197.4

"love the game only upset is its unstable multiplayer.",130.4
"just one more turn, dont worry, then ill write this review",267.6
"good game, steep learning curve but addictive when you get into it",141.5
"this game provides many styles of play that is possible to make it more engaging and replayable. online (especially with friends) is one of the best times you will ever have. each game can take hours to finish and is a great way to pass long periods of time or multiple short periods. i definitly reccomend this game because of it varity and replay ability.",194.0
"addictive and fun. its turn based, which allows for multitasking while playing, unless you want to immerse yourself. definitely buy the bigger dlcs as well if youre into strategy games, the smaller dlc packs dont do much.",197.5
"best game ever..................if youve got all day with nothing to do... :p",442.3
"i remember being captivated by civ1 back in high school while at a friends house. when civ2 was released, it dropped my college gpa possibly a whole point - it was that good. civ5 has taken the franchise to new heights. most of the annoyances are gone and there are many new facets of gameplay to explore like the faith system. im a little late to this game - its been out for a while but i really regret not purchasing this game earlier.",105.4
"absolutely everything you want it to be. the biggest change from previous civ games is to the actual placement of troops on the field -- units can no longer stack. the non-stacking may sound like a nerf, but it adds a new level of strategy to the game where you could previously just throw a huge stack of units at the enemy. the math-hammer is gone, and the game now plays more like chess. its a very simple improvement, but it really makes the game.",291.7
"i love this game,so many ways to win and lose,get nuked by the ing astecs this is a great game...",39.8
"dont trust gandhi!! whatever you do dont trust gandhi.",145.2

"quite enjoyable if you like turn-based strategic gameplay",204.2
"this game is the pinnacle of strategy, just the feel alone of controlling an entire empire rises above all else. i must say some areas of the game could be improved like the ai but if you get bored of many subjects in the game there is always mods to think about. dlc is also something to think about, even though its the price of the game i feel that it adds many more hours to the game and is worth the money. ive been playing this since it came out and im still enjoying it, with many civilisations and playstyles to choose from sid meiers civilisation 5 is the complete turn based strategy game. 9/10",360.2
"one a scale of 1-10 id give it a 9; it is a great game overall, but it doesnt account for the little things that make history dynamic, such as internal revolutions creating brand new nations, and it could use a bit more in the diplomacy, no removal, just addition.",188.1
"very well made game. still the best of its kind after several years and is a fun new experience every time you play. good game at improving your micromanaging skills as well as macro.",78.4
"what year is it!? ive been stuck in civanji for years!",168.9

"if you like crack, this is the game for you! often times i would find myself thinking man, i wish i had some crack. but just after one day of playing this game i realized, i dont need crack! i only need this game! so for all you hardcore fans of addicting things, you havent not lived until youve played this game! 10/10 cant stop playing",49.1
"higly detailed this game is missing lots of stuff i recommend dlc it will get thumbs down alone but with all major dlcs it will get thumbs up cause it makes it a better game.",48.9
"diplomacy is utter horse . other than that i love this game.",125.6
"this is, just like everyone says, a time-devourer. while the vanilla game was good, the two expansion packs (g&k and bnw) is probably the reason im still playing it. well, that and the mods. playing new maps everytime, coupled with a sandbox/free-for-all, makes this one of my favourite games (though civ iv had better music). there is just something unique with the artwork, intriguing quotes and of course that awesome feeling you get when you finally show gandhi whos boss (dont underestimate that sneak).",895.1
"i love this game with everything that can happen in it. there are unlimited possibilities to what your civilization can turn into. as you can see with my hour record that i am an enthusiast of civilization v. tip for people with slow computeres: use a mod called quick turns, it allows you to play in 3d mode rather than strategic game board mode because it speeds up all the processes. and with the hundreds of games ive played with it, i have come across no problems.",775.7
"it is a fun game. i think it is a strategic way to advance a culture and dominate the world. i reccommend it to strategy game lovers.",19.0
"this is the best strategy game i have ever played. 10/10",22.9
"this game will make you have sleepless nights, 10/10 would buy again (y)",145.7
"do not...i repeat...do not buy this game!! it will suck the life out of u!! it so  immersive ull stuck to playing it for hours!! n it is so addictive, it will melts ur social life. you have been warned!!",168.1
"great turn-based strategy with elements coming from the most important pieces of history, this game shows the ways civilizations interact in many ways. be an expanding colonial state, a traditional isolationist, a religious nation devoted to the spread of the faith, or many things both different and in-between. replay important wars of history making your own decisions, or blaze your own trail from the dawn of civilization to the modern era.",189.0
"sid meiers civilization v is a fanominal game, so long as you own the gold edition with brave new world. as you play through the stock civ, youll notice holes that are left making the previous game more desireable. the extras add so much that it is a shame that it wasnt the full game to start. overall it is great with the dlc.",89.1
"never tried offline multiplayer is bugged for alot of people they officially only support 8 players but you can play up to 16 players? start multiplayer +4 players: forget it if you are lucky you can play a game where noone disconnects and you can play it to the end and thats the only time it is fun. if you are like everyone else, someone disconnects or crashes : game is lost, continue with bots but game cant handle someone joining and makes everyone lag/disconnect/rage if you could i would ask my money back but i can only say: dont buy this unfinished game here is my playing experience: 2 finished games, 10 unfinished because of crashes, disconnects, leaves, never tried multiplayer because lan is this bad.",170.4
"fantastic game, loads of fun but even better with a couple of friends and all the dlcs.",131.7

"i have found this game very enjoyable and just as good as previous civilization versions",301.6
"just one more turn.... *72 hours later* 10/10 easily the best turn-based strategy game on steam.",83.8
"its a  game. for patient people only, very long games, like, minimum of 6 hours. 2 seaters can kill a small child.",269.8
"civ might be a little slow, but that is why you save the game. this game is really great if you have patience. if you dont then well get some because you are missing out.",356.9
"wow! even though it may say i have never played this game... i have... i play offline this game is a-quality and should not be over looked, i have played countless hours and highly enjoy it. if you are looking for a fun, expand-and-conquer like game. then this is for you. it is very intimate and i enjoy playing it greatly.",2.7
"just one more turn... is all you going to say after you found out that youve played a map for all the night.",260.7
"probably the best game i have ever played. thousands of ways to conquer the world with thousands of different countries. this game gives you a real feel to world domination and really allows you to spectate and watch your foes wither. its an absolute must buy. 10/10.",41.0
"you may think you can stop whenever you want.... but you cant... 10/10 would gladly hit next turn again",133.7
"lovely game, beautiful graphics, easy concept, all it needs is a few more empires, a few extra bonuses for each emipre. i love the game, such a great game! i recommend this game to whoever wants to have the best time ever in a strategy game. ***** (five stars!)",262.6
"armies and building and killing and farming and its a great way to kill time",27.5

"this game has all that you could want without feeling pretencious. get it.",161.6
"its good but you will end up playing it for like 15 hours straight",33.5
"i have spent the most hours on this game. a game that i  for. it is so lovely when you nuke the enemys capital, and when you go on super easy so you just dominate just for the hell of it. if you dont like this game, you havent played it or given it a real try.",517.2
"this game is simply a must have for all people who have steam.",269.6
"ill be going to bed soon honey! just one more turn!",20.5
"ahhh... civ 5. sid meier never seems to disapoint me. in this latest installment of the civ. series there is so much more than the past games. non stackable military units makes combat and warfare much more interesting. both dlcs are great too. the graphics are great and the ai is always willing to tear you a new one in anyway possible. if you are looking for a great in-depth rts, chess on roids then look no further.",115.6
"best strategy game ever buy it now or die of being bored!",57.6
"nothing beats being george washington in 1200 bc, allied with augustus ceasar, establishing washington in present day nigeria and philadelphia in present day sydney, not to mention the fact the hagia sofia is in new york. any rts or turn based players should pick this up.",441.3
"this is one of the best games ive ever played. i enjoy the travel through history and the advancements, the different ways to gain victory. sid meier really outdid themselves on this one.:)",6.1
"without a doubt one of the classiest games ever made, sid meiers civilization v is an epic experience through the ages of man; it has kept me returning and returning, always longing for more in a way that its predecessor did not. if you dont own this game, then buy it. if you do own this game, then send me an invite and lets conquer the world.",289.5
"a fun, deep and complex strategy game, civilization v is definately a gem worth picking up.",150.4
"a streamlined civ4 minus the stack of doom. civ5 is the best of the old with the new. 10/10 especially if you have all of the dlc and expansions which balance the game mechanics.",277.8
"civ 5 is an amazing game, once you start a game you will want to finish. i started as britain and over a few thousand years i had managed to be hated by the whole world, this is when i decided to strike. i started with india demolishing there country and army with my huge force of advanced soldiers, war in civ is quite tactical and requires planning; i started by surrounding the border with my army and naval force and then when my army is together i launch the attack and overwhelm the opponents army. i conquer india and proceed onto more countries. i managed to destroy every country in the world except america and ethiopia when i decided i had spent way too long on the game! :d 9.5/10",112.3
"a fun, strategic game with simple to set up multiplayer and so many different ways a game could go, from peacefull days to nuclear apocalypse, its one of the greatest games to play!",138.2
"the best series of all time as always in good shape. its my favorite and the worst game ever... why ? because iv lost so much time playing this game ^_^",70.6
"i was dropping nukes on the spanish while they were attcking me with pikeman. 10/10",224.9
"i once spent a month on a single game. was it worth it? to see ghandis face after hitting the pain in the **** with my entire arsenal of nukes, yes it definitely was.",124.2
"pros - feels like a full game without the dlcs - linux support! - offers hours upon hours of fun - high replayability due to the many different ways to win, and the different paths to accomplish thos victory conditions - good community involvement, workshop offers many cool mods to keep the game interesting for a long time overall i highly recommend this game",142.6
"civilization is doomed... civ v for linux? i will not be sleeping tonight.",109.4
"napoleon has 15 units in his army bismark has 100 units napoleon declares war on bismark napoleon somehow wins the war and captures berlin 10/10 would play again",224.9
"hundreds of hours of fun. one of my all time favorite games. good control of your civilization, and great game mechanics makes creates a strong replayabilty value. the music creates a good atmosphere and the fact that it is turn based allows you to play the game at your own pace and start and stop at any time. i can not recall the amount of times i have woken up early in the morning, brewed a pot of coffee, casually start a marathon game, and end up looking at a clock only to fine that it is eight at night. tl;dr: absolutely phenominal game, amd the sale that is currently going on is way too good to pass up.",168.0
"awesome game. latest expansion makes it a bit too easy i feel though against computers.",341.1
"great game, but seems like firaxis wont make a linux client, forcing linux users to use wine/variations or buy windows. i cant recommend this! its against my ideal updated: they really do a civ v linux client! finally i will play seriously civv like i played civiv and civiii on past! :)",75.2
"great game , can be a quite hard at times but overall very fun",140.9
"the most popular 4x game in the world has finally come to linux.",88.0

"great game!!! running well on linux mint 17 on intel hd 4400 (1080p low-medium settings) thanks :-)",36.1
"this is not a game for everyone, its not fast paced at all and it can take some time to learn. but if you can enjoy a slow paced strategy game then this is the game for you, there is a lot too it and if you and a group of friends decide to sit down and play this for a day then you will probably have a pretty good time. id rate this a acquired taste out of 10, its not for everyone but if you can enjoy it then you will really enjoy it.",263.9
"this is way better than civ iv! the hexagonal tiles and no unit stacking make this game the best civilization yet! however, it does take a while to load on my computer. i also like the giant death robot as a futeristic unit and that units embark without needing to build transport boats. i rate this game a 9/10!",94.9
"this game is so good, that the fact that you are spending time reading reviews and not buying the game is a shame and a waste of good play time. once you accuire the game you will understand what it means to press next turn just one more time, until you realize it is 6am.",192.6
"only play if you intend to not do anything else for the next day or two. its addicting.",125.2
"i have played this game for so long, but yet it does not get boring. you can keep on starting new games and it will always be different. with so many civilizations to play, it is almost impossible to get sick of this game. i highly recommend it.",306.5
"stupid ottomans took over my main capital and forced all my archers into forceful labor were they were slaughtered and put in piles. i can still smell the burning of the bodies from my other city on turn 60. they are moving their units to me burning everyone in the way alive inside wooden barns. the screams can be heard for multiple tiles away. great game 10/ottoman -cameorn",112.1
"only worth buying if you can get the entire thing + all dlcs massively discounted. its good fun dont get me wrong, but theyve basically made a decent game, then broken it into parts to milk all the money they can from the franchise. civ5 base + g&k + bnw = a decent game and worth buying in a bundle at 11.",440.5
"works just awesome on linux. great port! about the game itself, it is simply a great turn based game, if not the best in the category!",32.8
"sid meier has created a time machine. make entire days disappear with only a few more clicks with this game today.",90.3
"definantly one of the best strategy games out there, if your not a fan of long games that require a bit of strategy and thinking, you might want to stay away, but this is a fantastic game, that, if you read in the games archives it has actual facts instilled, but other than that its not a history lesson for the most part, and the civs you can play as are pretty balanced as far as everything else goes.",65.5
"bought the civ 5 brave new world expanison a day before it went on sale for 7 dollars. fml 10/10",42.0
"yes this game is very awesome dont ask questions just buy with all expansions. ive only been disappointed with the fact theres no germ warfare or chemical warfare. heres tip for you guys though dont trust the siam or the aztecs.",227.1
"spent 13 hours playing a game. got atomic death robots. was repeatedly nuked by the peaceful mahatma gandhi, then beaten in the race to alpha centauri by genghis khan. 12/10 for realism+general awesomeness",70.8
"one of the greatest rts/turn-base games i have every played. simple and easy to pick up, it is great for if you are new to this genre. on par with the total war games (although it is hard to compair as they are very different) it is good for anyone who enjoys this styoe of game.",74.3
"if youre a history lover you will enjoy this game. incredibly indepth and can be as challenging or as difficult as you want to make it. tons of dlc and tons of mindless marathon fun (seriously you can lose yourself in this game for a whole day). highly recommend.",457.5
"jam alert, this is my jammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm",39.4
"this game is way too addicting. love it. pretty historically accurate too. right down to rome rolling right over their neighbors the aztecs. its the little details that count. 10/10 would recommend.",55.7
"this game pretty much takes your spare time and turns it into concerns for a nation on a screen that you control, the thing about this nation is that its sole goal is to become the best nation in the world. pretty much the world longest cold war... 10/10 if you want to make your friends hate you buy right now",97.7
"well, ghandi nuked 3 of my cities in one turn. he is a believer in peace, just through mutually assured destruction. 11/10",352.6
"awesome game, very deep and satisfying! it was worth every penny! very fun to play with friends and alone, but kinda lacks the giant freaking huge maps that the previous games had, in my opinion. but that might just be my brain playing tricks on my! anyway, totally worth it! buy it!!",57.3
"its really strange that this game and civ iv are such different titles. the fundamentals are all there, but itll be a bit of a learning process comming to civ v over from civ iv. its still just as addicted as iv, but the aforementioned is something to keep in mind.",2.1
"a good game alone, even better with a few friends. only wish we could have mods in the multiplayer.",220.8
"a great strategy game. its different enough from age of empires to make it a unique and refreshing take on this style of game. youll wonder where the hours went after playing a session of this. there are multiple ways to win and hundreds of moves to be made. if you fire up a game today, dont expect to get anything else done until tomorrow.",32.5
"quite frankly, few attributes of games ellicit such anger and discontent as those found rampantly within the broken and consistently inconsistent formula that constitutes this game, civilization v. other games offer more refined methods, with more visually and mechanically sophisticated gameplay options than can ever be conceived of within this joke of a strategy game.",72.0
"great game! so fun being able to win without firing a single shot but also to have the option to nuke cities if i want :)",183.7
"i used to have cancer, and playing this game literally cured my cancer.",21.8
"this game is so much fun, and can consume so much of your time. i hear alot of things from people who have played the series saying that its not as good as iv, but having never played the series, it was amazing. pick up this game now.",102.0
"i honestly prefer civ ivs movement grid and that i dont need to keep one melee unit in my millions of archers who seemingly cannot take a town, not to mention the modern infantry being out-ranged by bows and arrows. still, the religion/city state/ideology concepts are enough to keep me playing for just one more turn",185.4
"if you go to college and you want to play this, you might as well quit college.",334.4
"unreal game with endless mods to make it that much better! now to rule the lands",16.1
"this game is awesome, i highly recomend getting it.",63.4
"this one time barbarians took my settler the very first round so i lost instantly........its very fun.",145.9
"a great way to kick back, relax, and have lots of random discussions with your friends.",127.2
"great strategy game that lets you sit back and think about the moves. very in-depth with lots of intricate processes such as faith, happiness and food. there is a wide variety of ways to win for each save game, withn random maps that will provide a collection of resources that will help you on the way. although every civ (ie. english) have different advantages and a couple of unique units, it isnt impossible to stray off their advantage on lower difficulties. this allows you to really explore and get a handle on any win type using any civ.",76.8
"this game game is the virtual military version of monopoly it consumes lives and time and will destroy freindship, still a great game though.",19.4
"very addicting, fun, makes you think, worth every penny.",33.9
"the best strategy game i have played in my life. it puts its predecesor games to shame as well as making the game as close to reality as possible. adding many exciting aspects that i am sure all respectable gamers can enjoy.",337.3
"do have friends? then the best use for them would be to play this game with them. the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is engrossing, and the concept holds it own. you really should pick it up and become a master of civilization!",373.4
"civilization 5 is one of my favorite games! not only is it extremely interesting what will happen the next turn, but it even keeps you wondering the next day! it is very addicting, has many nations to choose from, and has a very uplifting soundtrack. however, the price is a bit high, and i suggest you wait until a sale for the game comes out (for example, $7.49 instead of $29.99). overall, you should definitely purchase this game.",30.6
"amazing game that will definitely make the hours fly by.",427.5
"this game is probably the best strategy game i have ever played. its extremely fun with friends, and its not too difficult to understand while still being somewhat complex. i think it deserves its metascore rating of 90. however, it crashes on me frequently. so frequently that i may have to reload 20-30 times in order to play a single game. after researching this problem, its apparently common in the steam version.",54.8
"this game is pretty rad, but only comparable to civ4bts with all the expansions. best wait for a sale on the whole package beore picking up, kek",6.3
"holy ing  this is one of the best ing games ive ever played in my entire ing life.",78.5
"history, a. learn you some past and get to beat some historical . also,  gandhi that a attacked me unprovoked.",91.5

"with almost 300 hours logged and gifting copies to most of my friends, i can justly say my opion is very high of this game. its beyond addictive and so entertaining. you truly get lost in this game and the hours seem to disapear. so beware.",464.8
"fantastic game. offers hours of game play and makes time fly by.",45.0
"nuking my best friends when they are 3 ages below me its a feeling like your a god.",89.5
"what can i say... its civ - of course its good! initially though i did find it a little more frustrating than civ iv in that every single ai opponent wants to go to war with you - even ghandi!, but they can be relatively easily kept at bay on all but the highest difficulty levels if you are leading the tech race and have a full kitty (and if you dont have either of those - youre not doing it right ;p). overall, an interesting and fairly replayable addition to an already great series.",34.5
"this is a great game, nuff said. there are hours of fun awaiting you if you pick this up. not for the faint of heart.",953.5
"im probably going to have to uninstall this game. ive never been a strategy game player. but civ 5....i cant get off it. the game is great. with so much to do and so many ways to win, i cant imagine getting bored with this anytime soon.",78.9
"possibly the best entry in this genre defining franchise. i would absolutely love to see alpha centauri delivered using this engine.",124.9
"civ v is the turn-based strategy game for the ages. soon after playing for the first time, youll be glued to this game for hours upon hours, and youll love it. great for anyone who loves them a good strategy game, or for anyone with a passing interest in them. the astounding variety in civilizations and game possibilities, as well as multiplayer make this game worth every penny and gold piece. hex grid master race.",164.3
"we are anonymous. civ v is a great game. if you have not played any civ game, you have not yet lived.",26.5
"the best if its genre by a mile and a half. highly recommended if you like your strategy games with a friendly learning curve, but still with that intricacy that can take a long time to master. (has an in built user friendly modding system in the main menu)",80.8
"just amazing, turn based, think ahead strategy game. when on sale, its really worth your money.",161.2
"very good game, great multiplayer, thought it would be boring, boy was i wrong, great change of pace with no hiccups,",7.6
"my god is this game a beauty. i honestly have no explanation for how good it is other than nukes. exploration. conquest. 10/10",39.7
"such an addicting game. i honestly lose track of time when i play civ and i end up playing for hours. such an in depth and immersive world there really arent words to describe it. strongly recommend to anyone who plays rts games. one quick hint though . . . never trust france. ever.",206.4
"great game with a lot of content and diverse strategies. great for playing with friends. it is very time consuming.",563.2
"this is one of the greatest games for pc. i highly recomend it, however civ 5 and the brave new world (bnw) dlc are even better.",419.7
"amazingly detailed and superbly balanced rts game that sees you take one of the many historic civilizations of the worlds history to full dominence of the whole world, through all past present and future time periods.",189.2
"what can i say, it is civilization one of its kind, legendary since 1991. i am really glad it has finally got linux support. it needs the latest video drivers, but you should update them regulary anyway.",21.4
"an absoloutly amazing game the only annoying thing is that a few days after i bought it steam had a 75% off sale which is frustrating but i cant do anything about it. i highly recommened this game 10/10",12.4
"probably the best strategy game out there..very complicated yet great fun!",63.6
"great game to play with friends. couldnt ask for a smarter time wasting game.",73.5
"if you love strategy games, you wil love this game!",123.4
"ive enjoyed civilization v since the original release. it did feel a bit lacking late game and resulted in a lot of tedious simple battles. theres room for improvement, the ai is still kind of dumb and you do end up in some tedious spots, but with the two expansions i think this is the best of the main civilization series now. the linux port is excellent too! the only thing lacking is some of the graphics options available in the windows version, but its a small difference and the game runs very well.",121.5
"this game is beautiful. does it really need another recomendation? im sure youve heard of it or seen gameplay. one of hte absolute best turn-based stratgey game. p.s. if you get the gods and kings expansion, be prepared to look at an ugly pubic haired jesus wanna-be staring off into the sunset wandering where his life went wrong every time you start the game up... freaking hated seeing his face.",129.3
"what a great game so far... i havent really played it multi yet, but single, online or off, is fun! i recommend this game to all my friends!",41.8
"great game to play alone or with friends, but be warned games can take forever to complete",421.7
"fun game... but warning it eats up time by the day!",136.8
"a game where ghandi will nuke all your cities 10/10",7.6
"this version of civilization is pale in comparison to its predecessor when it comes to depth an complexity, and i dislike it for that fact. however civilization 5 is one of my most played games. civ 5 is part of the new accessible breed of sequels, designed to bring a known franchise down to the knuckle-dragging level of complexity so xbox kids and fratboys dont feel like total dip when trying to master the intricacies of the lowest difficulty. it is simple, it is fun, you really only need to know one or two tricks to win on any map at any difficulty, and then thats it, you get to master civ 5 and brag to all your friends about it. its fun, simple, different, and more akin to a board game than previous civ iterations.",345.4
"this game can drag you out for hours and make you say hey, just one more turn then ill get off. but nope, that nation just provoked you and now youre going to kick their . this game is a classic and is truly fun. dont underestimate it.",16.5
"another civilization game and another stroke of genius. this game allowed for a personal approach to civilization development based on my own preference rather than providing a single formula for success. this is a great turn-based game and i strongly reccoment it.",53.2
"very good rts but the matches could take a day no lie.",46.8
"best game ever but i think more civilizations are needed",351.9
"this game is simply awesome, whole game is just one big high quality strategy fun fest.",64.6
"great game to play with friends, i suggest if your gonna get this games dlcs, they bring alot to the table 10/10",122.0
"want a nice casual game to play? well then buy another game. civ5 is an addicting game to where it has you saying just one more turn and boom 20 turns later you have conquered a nation, built numerous armies, and researched new tech. get this game if you love strategy and you want to waste your life away playing this for days. #onemoreturn",63.5
"very good game but it takes your whole day for one game towards modern era... 9/10 is my rating",16.0
"+++ for linux port. great game for great os - nice combo!",49.5

"there is a bit of a learning curve but once you figure out the game you will find your selfspending more time playing this game than expected and the dlc makes the game that much better 9/10",149.5
"civ 5 is like playing an epic game of chess, with more than 2 players, dozens more pieces and nukes. add a side of diplomacy and espionage, to top it off with some awesome strategy sauce.",94.8
"you will not be disapointed. id have a better gpa if it wasnt for this game. would do it all over again. 10/10",802.2
"the best turn-based strategy game of all time. period.",47.9
"awsome strategy game, for all sid meyers fans: this is one to pick up. bought at steam sale, well worth every cent.",7.1
"calling this game good would be a bit of a stretch. it has some nice new inovations likw the hex tiles........oh thats it. i personaly feel this game is in every single way inferior to civ 4 and the way that the modding has been almost imposible is shocking. the mod comunity for every previous version of the game added to the flavour. sid seems to have decided that they should be  blocked like they did with xcom which was another shocker.",15.0
"what has not already been said about this game? nothing, you should buy it. that is all.",174.2
"10 hours at a stretch / 10 would stay up late again",348.4

"absolutely perfect soundtrack, plenty of variety in your choice of strategy, a selection of leaders and civilizations that means every game can be completely different make this the perfect addition to the library of any fan of strategy or history",315.6
"this game is amazing well worth the money and it has endless replayability.",149.6
"such a great game! make sure you have a very powerful processor, or turn-times near the end of the game can take a very long time. really though, if youre into strategy games, this is the best one out.",1081.5
"you know when you go to a party and theres that one really good pie that youre just waiting to have and when it finally opens every runs for it and you fight your way through just to have one slice and you finally get to it and the biggest, best piece is left? yeah this game is that pie...its awesome",292.3

"i started playing civization when the o.g (civ 1) came with a giant manual you had to keep around if you wanted to play the game. the game would tell you to look up a page in the manual, and then ask you for the 7th word on the 6th line, and make you type it in to continue the game. early days of pirating. used to play it on a macintosh (yes children, it used to be macintosh) quadra 605. that baby was a beast! what do you know about 4mb ram? 100mb hard drives? anyways... i digress.... civ 5 is an amazing game. generic did this, must buy 11/10 comment.",89.5
"civilization v is one of the most addicting strategic simulation games youll find. you start building your simple empire, and soon will feel the pull of power just begging you to take over the world. friends become foes, their resources become yours, and nothing can stop you. 10/10 would recommend.",375.0
"this is a turn-based game which you probably already know.it doesnt have the smartest ai.but it has a ton of replay value.tons of fun.if you do buy this game buy the complete edition.ive had the burden to buy most of the content that didnt come with the game.",55.9
"this game is an absolutely blast! requires some patience though because games tend to last a while. luckily, there is a save feature. you could be playing the same game for weeks!",40.2
"i am a bit older and played civ 1,2, and 3. i had to buy this on the summer sale. it started off a bit hard for me as it has changed a lot. but i am already hooked again. cant reco enough.",24.1
"very indepth and challenging lots of fun, a good way to pass the time.",218.6
"civilization is just one of those games where you waste your intire life.if you ever wanna pass the time you should play it!it is a strategy game where you choose a civilization and try to beat the game via science,domination,culture,diplomatic or time (no-one likes time cause its cheap) victory.enough talk if you wanna learn the game,play the game!!!",328.1
"highly recommended. it will take over your life, eventually youll escape, then a year later itll take over your life again.",222.5
"awesome game. one of the best strategy turn-based ive ever played",18.3
"a great strategy game! can be manipulated anyway you want really. control every detail or allow computer to auto-assign certain units with tasks. has a wide range of difficulty settings. my favorite is to just setup a random game and play through as much time as i can. my only complaint is it ends way too soon. a great game you will want to play over and over!",41.5

"judaism foundation in istanbul? chingis-khan has nuclear bomb and treating caesar with it? why not, it is civilization.",312.5
"great game for the strategist who needs more time. ive always played rts games like age of empires and sucked but civ v is different because you have time to make your moves. there are multiple ways to enjoy the game and i found myself pleasantly surprised more than once.",143.7
"if you like building a empire from the ground up this is definetly a game to check out. its got everything from diplomatically resolving all war in the world to bombing everyone but yourself into the stone age.",238.0
"addicting game, much fun. good if you like turn-based strategy. good time-sink. dont start before exams...",457.7
"the gist of it is, if youve liked civ3 or are new to civ youll definitely enjoy civ 5. its well worth your money and is probably one of the most enjoyable strategy titles from 2010. if youre a big civ4 fan (i wasnt really) then you might find a few things not great. theres been a few changes around but in general it is a fun and addictive game to play and i can recommend it completely.",78.1
"very fun game that lags in the later turns. easy to put 50+ hours in though.",12.3
"great game! as a matter of fact i consider the early game the weakest link in the game while the rest is pretty well-done and well-polished, considering that they released two dcls for the game to make it far superior than the original version. keep up the good work! p.s. if you want to purchase this game, do include atleast the brave new world dcl, otherwise you might be in for a shock.",119.6

"great fun, very addictive, make sure you have plenty of time when playing this game as you will keep telling yourself just one more turn which can go on for hours before you realise. great fun on multiplayer as you attempt to out-do your friends economically or technologically or aid them against their enemies, or, even become their enemies.",208.9
"if youve ever wanted to see if madoka could take out ghandi and eggman in continental warfare within 8 hours, this is the game for you. the games awesome on its own, the expansions make it better, and the mods make it more enjoyable.",7.2

"this game did not start out as good as previous installations, but with the 2 major dlc and to a lesser extent the many minor dlc, this has earned the usual place as the best 4x game of this generation. i hope that the new alpha centari (or whatever they are calling it), will be a complete game upon release unlike this one, but as usual this is the gold standard for 4x gaming and something you definitely want to pick up especially if it happens to be on say a huge steam summer sale :)",283.1

"starting playing this game at 7:00 pm yesterday. played for what seemed like a few hours until i realized the sun was starting to come out. if you start playing, then i hope you have nothing else to do for the rest of, and the next, day. totally worth it. 10/10",56.3
"one more turn please............probably the most addictive game ever....",14.5
"if youre buying the standalone civ v youll be in for a fairly decent, if slightly reduced, civilization experience. get it with brave new world though, and youll have one of the best civilization games to date. it may have taken some time and a couple of expansions to get there but eventually civ v has become the game it should have been to begin with. get it on a sale with brave new world, and any other expansions, and youll ahve a game that will eat hours of your life up, leave you with crpal tunnel syndrome in your mouse hand and a feeling that you should question just why you always decide to kill any enemy civs that dare open fire on you.",51.4
"i started a new game today... well what i consider today... but to everyone else is might be like 4 days or so... i cant really tell how much time has passed.. i keep lookin at the clock and it always says 6pm.... anyway im about to nuke russia, just one more turn........

"be all the leaders! make all the wonders!! win all the games!!! have all the fun, all the time, forever!!!!!!!!!!!",891.9
"this game is magnificent. asthetically pleasing to the eyes, easy mechanics to pick up, you can screw up a lot but it wont absolutely condemn you (unless you get zerg rushed xd). very re-playable with all the different ways you can play it. very fun strategy game, you get to pretty much re-write history and not many games do that. i highly recommend this game, i play it almost every day for hours. the first time you play it youll be up until sunrise. no lie.",927.8
"very fun game to play. ai is incredibly stupid at certain things. also if you get the game buy the complete edition. the game is incomplete without them.",451.6
"i grew up on civilization. this is a new twist on an old favorite.",23.5
"just... one... more... turn.... this phrase basically defines this game. extremelly adictive, civ v is one of my favorites ever. just be careful, if you start playing at 7:00 pm, next time youll look at the clock it will be 4:00 am. true story.",222.6
"the ai keeps being grumpy with me. sure i attack them, seige their cities, spy on their capitals and kill their troops but is that really a reason for them to stop being nice, they should still happily buy my stuff...so i can build more troops to take their cities. it is for their own good. sometimes i feel like im the bad guy, but that cant be the case...",102.2
"finally, something to fill in for my lack of a linux compatible city simulator game. its not quite the same thing, but the ability to play with friends makes it fun in other ways. i hear the controls are just as non-intuitive under windows.",136.4
"the continuation of sid meiers renowned turn based strategy game series civilization sees substantial changes from the mechanics to which veterans of the series are accustomed. these changes to the core workings of the game (especially the lack of religion and espionage) make it feel incomplete to those coming from a background of playing civ iii and iv. that being said, many of these issues are fixed with the gods and kings and brave new worlds expansions. so whist the default game is fundamentally flawed, the fixed (expanded) version of the game is an awesome rendition of the series and well worth a look.",152.6

"very fun game. you can get caught up in it very easily. better with friends",26.7
"graphically superior to any other turn based strategy game i know, civ v is my favorite platform for historical inaccuracies. you may not be much for strategy games, but nuking ghandi never gets old. i give it a 7.8/10 but with gods and kings i would give it a 9/10. i might also mention that the max graphics look like an oil painting...",181.9

"it is a turn based strategy game that involves giving instructions to cities, workers, and millitary units. i enjoy strategy games quite a lot, but if you dont; this might not be your cup of tea. i enjoy the music, graphics, and the hexagonal spaces, which allow for complicated troop manuevering.",181.4
"well, what can i say about this game? hmm...i bought it, downloaded it, proceeded to play for 10 hours straight. uh-huh, yeah. this game...this game. i didnt think i would like it, but my all my friends bought it, so i decided to. i quickly got addicted. a big factor for that was all of the fps games i had been playing, so this was a nice change of pace. definitely a game that is worth your money (although i got the base game and all dlcs on sale for $17.00). so yeah, um, yeah.",347.3

"ive been a fan of the series since civ iii. i highly recommend it for its depth and new game mechanics. while the ai can be wonky or completely insane at times, i still very much enjoy the game. the switch to the hexagon tiles instead of square makes the game feel more organic. roads twist and turn, the borders of your country have a logical creep rather than the fat cross ive grown accustomed too. if youre a fan of sid mieiers games, i am sure you will like this. the expansions add a whole new level of gameplay. especially the tourism and cultural portion from the brave new world dlc.",483.2

"depending on who you ask, the civilization games are either very complicated, or babbys first turn-based strategy game. as a person in the former camp, who doesnt really play a lot of games in the genre, the in-game help and highly customizable difficulty levels do a terrific job of flattening the learning curve for newcomers.",80.2
"civilization v for me is better than any other civilization game because: - you can no longer stack units which makes the game a lot more challenging - every tile has a hexagon shape allowing you to move your units more unpredictably - better graphics and sound effects - you dont need to spend long hours studying about the game. advisors assist you a lot in the beginning and the in-game encyclopedia is very detailed the only complaint really is that it can take a little bit of time after playing the game for long hours to procees the opponents moves in single player mode what surprises me is that people who i know that they dont like turned based games, by watching me playing this game have grown to like it and now they are playing it themselves",127.2

"i simply love this game, every game is different and enjoyable, you can customize enough to make it pretty darn challenging or a sandbox laidback session. i def. recommend this. seriously. buy this game. play it.",173.8
"the single best strategy game i have ever played. sessions of this game take a while, but it keeps you enthralled and offers a lot of replay value due to dlc and a huge amount of characters to play. if you have ever enjoyed a strategy game, and have not already played this one, buy this game.",269.3
"i once went over to a freind of mines house at 9:00 am. i sat down at the desk next to him, grunted a hello, then loaded up civ v. his parents kicked me out around 11:00 at night. i proceeded to go home and play it for another few hours before passing out on my desk. woke up the next day with a migrane and an overheated laptop. all of my progress was gone. almost killed someone. game was pretty good btw.",154.0

"i have enjoyed the civilization series since the first game rolled out in the 1990s. although civilization iii and iv had some really great features, i do like the flexibility that civ v offers. the addition of religion as a victory standard is good. the traditional means of attaining victory are still there (cultural, science, conquest, diplomatic), so not much of a change there. i do like the hexigonal map base better than the squares of past civ installments., however, there are a few things that i do believe needs to be altered in the game. in civ iv, if your culture was dominant, it was possible to expand your borders through culture. this feature is missing. i would also like more freedom in using the spies, as was available in civ iv.",368.2
"good game, very fun to play with friends and others. but keep in mind the solo game isnt as fun as brave new world. so if your gonna get this game better get brave new world as well.",243.5
"civ v is a must-have game for any strategy game lover. it has everything they could want in a game. economy, military units, diplomacy, multiple victory conditions, different civilizations, and so on. the only thing lack luster in this game is the diplomacy. civilization games just never have had a stellar diplomacy engine. the a.i. has always been a little derpy but nothing that can be frustraiting. just dont be expecting help from allies, or many allies for that matter.",113.5

"very good strategy game.exceeded my expectatons.solid gameplay and easy to learn.9/10",15.6
"civ 4 was great. almost flawless, exept it was super buggy. bit civ 5 fixed all those bugs, made graohical improvements, and increased the politiacal part of the game. it was great to be able to use youre money for stuff, and all units can go on water. this game is bacially like civ 4 but easyer to star out with. wars were much more fun becasue the cities can defend themselves without units. the polotics of the new game made it alot more fun to play against ai, becase they are super violent and offendable, so there will be alot more war, which is good fun. the games are also alot longer becase by the 20th century, each turn was a single year so a game could easily be 10 hours long. i fully recomed this game. 9/10",86.7
"do not purchase this version of civ v if you intend to run in windows 7, with directx 10 or 11. simply put, ive experienced nothing but crashes every few mintues with the steam digital version of civ 5.",19.8
"great game, would strongly recommend. its very addicting though, so make sure you dont have anything pressing to do the next day when you start playing it. the expansions make the game a lot better; once you play with them you really wont be able to understand how you played the base game.",86.3
"i have played almost 180+hrs and would recondmend to almost anyone. if you get it you should pick up the gods and kings expansion (assuming it doesnt come with you verson) it just makes it a better game. i played without g/k once and nearly cried.",248.1

"fantastic fun if you like turn based strategy. defintley great if your a history buff like me and can nerd out cranking out 40 panzers to simulate your own blitzkreig on the poor underteched cpu and then get nuked by gandhi the ...seriously...gandhi is the biggest prick of all the ai, but apart from that the games great. get all the dlc, g&k really improves the combat with new units (and civs i think?) while bnw just overhauls the entire late game to make all victory conditions more engaging, interactive, and entertaining.",217.0
"this game has overtaken my life. i want my life back, please.",26.6
"its pretty hard to grasp your head around it if you walk in blind. but if someone gives you a hand while you learn it, youll master it in no time. and once youve mastered it, god damn is it addicting. totally recommended for any strategy hounds.",384.8

"i have been a long time fan of civ games and this one is just the natural progression of what has been a very good line of games. anyone a fan of strategy and 4x games would do well to play this. combined with the workshop, there is endless replay value to an already great game. i even recommend all the dlc, and that is something i rarely do. get it, play it, its good. 85% greatness. (where 50% is average)",678.8
"hours and hours worth of gaming here. playing now for almost 4 years. its amazing how theyve been able to keep basically the same formula since the first civilization game in the early 90s and it has the same addictive feel now in civ v as it did then. there are many different scenarios to achieve victory in this game. it doesnt have to be about conquest. you can win this game diplomatically, scientifically, culturally or time (highest score at last turn). you dont even have to quit your current campaign when you run out of turns. scoring will stop but you can build your empire for as long as you like. if you are able to get the expansions with this game, i highly recommend doing so. they add so much to the vanilla game that i dont think i could ever go back to it. they just keep making it better.",338.0
"ive literally never spent as much time on a game in my life as i have with civ 5. massively addictive.",932.7

"i have to say that after two purchase, i cannot play yet. the game is not opening in the full screen and i cannot access the button to push truough the initial screen menu i have checked everywhere in the manuals, but no hope. for few months worked properly, then suddenly it stopped to function, and even i purchased an expansion, so to eventually have the chance to have the inital setting back, it doesnt work.",72.2
"civ 5....., its a great game which can be easily understood. honestly, ive probably sank too many hours into this already, but it seriously deserves at least a try. its easy to pick up, hexagons work great, and its a lot of fun. if you havent played a civ game before, basically you build a civilization from the ground up from the ancient era to the information era and beyond. it involves diplomacy, military, research and culture. the only main gripe i have with this game is that the ai is dumb. like really dumb. i can win wars with four units against twenty of their units because: a: they dont know how to take cities, and b: positioning is important, they dont know how to do that. 9/10",170.4
"great way to make huge chunks of time disappear. 9/10 - some ai annoyances but other than that this is a great game.",17.4

"game is great as content, but runs very slow while advancing through game on older machines who only meet minimum requirements",9.7

"this game is addictive. stupidly. many have complained that the game has had too much taken out to appeal to a wider market. ignore them. the changes are for the most part sensible, and improve the flow of the game. the gods & kings expansion tweaks things further and makes the whole package feel more complete. ok, so diplomatic relations still go south once you get to a certain size - and someone is bound to attack you if you dont so maintaining a strong army is essential and can make it harder to seek other victory types but it isnt a game breaker. im having ridiculous fun after 100 hours and ive barely scratched the surface.",212.6

"i no longer have life all that is left is civilazation",116.9
"this is a awesome game it takes me back to the times i was playing command and conqure for the ps1 and ps2 it truly is a amazine game i recomend you buying it. it is very cheap for what you get and i almost forgot its on pc so you can easly mod it there are also some great mods out there one of my best mods are the world war 2 remake mods it is a fantastic mod and you can choose to be any country form britain, france, germany,usa,ussr it is a classic mod and i hope the guy or girl makes another! this is my post on this game thanks for reading! btw check out my youtube channel i am starting to make some videos on this game i just need to find the right capture software!",14.1
"if you have any experience with civilization games previously, do yourself a favor and buy the complete version of this that includes gods and kings and brave new world. the dlc for this game takes what was otherwise an okay, but kind of pared down and boring version of civ, and turns it into the best civ game since alpha centauri. other things of note if you are an older civ player looking at this game: - units are restricted to (basically) one unit per tile. at first this seems terrible, but in the long run youll wonder why you ever put up with stacks of doom. - instead of squares, you have hexes. this increases the strategic depth of the game a lot. - india will still nuke the hell out of you the first chance they get.",429.9
"great turn-based strategy game.everything is well made i like the mulitplayer that you can save the proggres that you have acomplished with the players that you are playing with.everything is well polished.",33.0
"i enjoy this game a great deal. a little tricky to start with but well worth it.",11.6
"obviously a classic series that continues to improve with every release, but be warned: the ai is inherently bad and does not play better on higher difficulty settings. instead, the game simply assigns better starting resources and disposition to the computer opponents, making the game incredibly unfair in the beginning, only to level out and eventually fall in your favour towards the end. when i discovered this fact, i was compelled to stopplaying, but i still dont regret the nearly 400 hours i spent on it.",391.4
"if you have all the expansions and dlc for the game it wil not let you go so easely.. just one more turn!!!",103.9
"too many problems to list running this game. i7, p8 z78 pro gen 3 mobo, 16g corsair ram, 256g ssd and gt 560 ti. game wont launch at all ever since i bought the dlc. updated all drivers, verified game cache, uninstalled, re-installed, and did a rain dance for good measure. game is broken. has been uninstalled and im not going to bother trying to  with it again.",20.6
"good solid game. best civ game out to date. hex battle system is pretty great.",216.9
"great game and with the expansion you have many ways you can grow your civilization. wonderful and relaxing!",358.0
"the game is well made and a lot of fun, however, it has to be said that although its a very good game, of the 200+ hours i currently have spent in the game, about 27 seconds have been in a multplayer where nothing went wrong, if intending to play with friends, please be aware that although possible, it will almost certainly cause problems.",321.8
"how do you describe sid meiers civilization v? long story short, you cant. one of if not the best game i currently , and probably will ever, own in my steam account.",332.5
"this is my first taste of the sid meiers series but i have to say - unbelievable. the curve is a bit steep for me personally since my mind doesnt think as democratically as it should for success to be guaranteed in a game like this, but laning this with friends is one of the best times ive had in a long, long time.",39.8
"best turn based strategy of this generation. challenging for most.",202.2
"this is the game equivalent of crack. just one more turn. before you know it, hours have gone by. a great game. its really fun to build your empire, research new technologies, and interact with your neighbors. great game for an all night lan party as well.",52.8
"amazing game almost no critique except the fact that it is quite boring to play alone, make sure to have some friends to play with. runs smoothly on my ok laptop.",16.4
"this game turns the phrase just one more turn. into the biggest 5 hour lie youve ever told. you will think, ill just fire up civ v and play a few turns before bed. at 10pm and the next thing you know, its 5 in the morning. even if turn-based strategy games arent normally your thing, you should still play civ v. its that good.",53.4

"this game literally is probably one of the best games i have ever played single player. it contains hundreds of hours of fun with the ability to play as your favorite historical civilization. i went out and got the 4th civ to try it and couldnt play because of how awesome civ 5 is. one downfall may be that the online doesnt really work too well so playing with friends isnt the best option. but if you look at this from a single player game standpoint it is a gem. i would recommend this to a friend and i give it 10/10 my most played steam game.",123.9
"we all know that feeling when another civ put a city in your spot and you nuke all the citys in the game 2000 years later",243.7
"very fun game. many different playstyles to choose from, and a lot of civilizations to chose, and rule with. also great mods out there.",183.4
"hands down the best strategy dame to date, especially when you have both expansion packs. brave new world adds mind boggling diplomacy and trade features that make this game top notch.",46.8

"sid meiers civilization v has extrordinary and fun addtions to it. i highly suggest this game to all who love strategy, and challenges. a+++++++",243.2
"it is my favorite of the series. it simplifies the game compared to 3 and 4 which was always a turn off to me. the matches will last a good 8+ hours even if its against a computer. 8/10 for me.",72.8

"one of the best strategy games of all time. a beautiful work of art where you muct make hard decisions and actually feel like you are a leader. will you be a good king? an evil empoerer? or a neutral dictator who chooses to be blind to he outside world? will you raise an army to roll over all nations? or will you choose to work in harmony for a peaceful world? its all up to you!",58.4

"its historic and a very good game you learn a lot while playing it and the strategy in this game is like non other its amazing i love it thx for a great game",27.4
"civ 5 is the best 4x game out in my opinion. everything works perfectly to create that just one more turn state of mind that keeps on bringing you back to play more. plus mods just enhance the experience allowing you to play however you want.",80.2
"a really simple and easy to pick up strategy game that even people new to strategy games can pick up and enjoy. its a really good game that goes into a high amount of detail on the map and in terms of facial animations of each leader (of which there are lots of). i would really recommend picking up the gods & kings and/or the brave new world dlc as these add new features to the game and fix a lot of bugs. well worth a go if youre even slightly interested in strategy games, it is definitely a good time sink.",164.0
"a must have for every fan of the series. especially with g&k and bnw expansions. shines in multiplayer as well (though its lacks stability a bit and has a few other bugs).",264.5

"was neighbours with gandhi -- didnt get nuked! 10/10",180.9
"a classic revamped well, my last play of this game was civ2, so im jumping to this, no longer need to have roads everywhere, a more intuitive system, you can play many different ways with many different advantages. still this feels quite military based, almost forced, a great new and polished version of a classic. the simple view is a perfect idea for lower end computers too! speeds up gameplay alot. the addition of marathon mode is quite highly recommend to try, it really feels like you grow with your empire, then play a standard game and you can see how much you learn playing a very long game. i would recommend this for beginner to advanced players, it can suite the toughest, and the newest to gaming.",37.4
"this game is one of if not the best strategy games out there. the civ games have always been fun to play. the only thing you should do is give this game all the money.",286.6
"favorite franchise of all time. this delivers like all the others.",434.7
"great game. basically the latest/best civ. only real negative for me is that they seem to have simplified diplomacy/trading (cant trade maps,etc..)",163.0
"this game is possibly my favorite pc game to play. ive spent literally days on this game. it may seem a bit complicated at first, but its really easy after you play it for a bit. even after youve played it for a long time, there are enough civilizations and maps to choose from that this game can always seem fresh and new. i especially enjoy the multiplayer aspects. essentially, you play through each game as a civilization of your choosing and try to make your civilization last for the entire game. you can set rules such as how long the game lasts, what ways you can win, and what specials each player is allowed to have. my friend and i have played countless matches against each other. i highly recommend this game to anyone interested in strategy games.",124.7
"if youre going to buy this game, spend the extra 30 bucks to buy the gold edition",130.9

"great game, but what else would you expect from a sid meier. though dont play expecting iv, and dont be surprised when your ai friends go full  and stab you in the back as soon as they get a chance. still an amazing game, hence all those hours ive put in. aslo, buy all the expansions before judgeing. civilization v isnt very good on its own to be honest. but if you like turn based games and building a civilization of beauty and science or just wanna watch the world burn before your very eyes then buy this game. warning:good 4x games will take your life away and time will dissapear. rating: 10/10",428.3
"i have to say that after civ4 i was hesitant but as a civ fan i went ahead and bought the game and the dlc. after over 100 hours, i can easily say it was worth it and will continue to be worth it.",145.7
"this game is simply great. you can easily loose half a dozen hours without even noticing.",609.2
"with all the hours i have invested into this game, its needless to say that i enjoy this game thouroughly(or have been afk for a long time). this is the game that got me out of fpss and rpgs, and into the, honestly more strategic, point and click genre. the majority of the gameplay ive experienced is without the dlc packs, and i loved this game still. only recently did i pick up these dlc packs, but even before they were purchased, anytime i would have time, id pick up my laptop and play the crap out of this game until my laptop crashed from overheating. 9/10(anyway you look at it) - a definent buy.",650.8
"civ5 is one of the best strategy games i have ever played with a clear understanding of how the world evolved to be this way it is now and it only has one bug! you can get another players cities with out even them accepting the offer! however overall this is a great game!",132.7
"it is a game which is well worth it once you learn the in-game mechanics. i have spent far more time on this game than any of the other games i have, and the satisfaction when you completely destroy a civ that stabbed you in the back is unmatchable.",233.6
"i dont even need security clearances to fire a nuke. 420/10",254.5

"it needs an update when ever i get to the loading screen it crashes",18.3
"a great way to pass some time without resorting to mindless tv.",190.0
"this game is what every city-building games wishes to be. also, the graphics are beautiful and there is a combat system that doesnt suck in a city-building/strategy game.",24.4
"i am sure the game is great but i cant get it to work on my computer. not to happy that i buy aa game from a store with the disc and product key but have to run it through this steam program. all they want to do is sell me stuff. if i wanted to buy from them i would have downloaded the steam program and not went to the store.",0.2
"this game is glorious, but it should not be billed as steam play exactly, because multiplayer fails to launch if a pc and a mac are in the same game.",232.5
"if you like this type of game then how come you arent buying it and reading this instead!",63.8
"good game. fun, basic strategy game. good addition to the series.",650.6
"if you like to game while intoxicated, this is the game for you! it can be played with one hand! what more can an alcoholic gamer ask for! please note: prospects of victory depend on a ratio of level of intoxication divided by level of difficulty.",116.3
"some people have compared this game to other strategy games such as empire earth and age of empires, however i see civ as cocaine and other strategy games as flour. sure, theyre both white powders which you can snort, however which one is going to keep you up til 2oclock in the morning wanting more?",547.8
"very addicting and interesting , if you want a casual gameplay play on prince difficulty , if you want an real strategic gmaeplay play on emperor :)",43.3
"hatch an evil plan to dominate the world, control the land and kill everyone! or just get beat to death by a horde of barbarians as you struggle to research about the wheel. such realism. 8.5/10",97.8
"this is my first civilization game. it took me a couple hours to really get the hang of it, but now i am completely addicted. i like that you can win several different ways. this is a nice change from having to kill everyone else on a map. i also like that ability to adjust the game speed so i can play a game in a few hours or few days. i highly recommend this if you like turn based strategy.",1021.8
"you can end a war by giving all your cities to another empire, or win one with the power of religion. so yeah.",183.9
"really fun game for war strategy and on top of that it gives alot of interesting facts from that time",79.3
"great and fun game to play.... love every minute in game!",139.0
"all the civilization games are worth the time. who doesnt love an awesome turn-based strategy game? however, the developers should have spent more time of getting this game more stable, especially in multiplayer.",655.9
"this game is a total time suck. and i mean that in a good way. when i start playing, i want to keep playing for hours on end. i find it very hard to turn off in the middle of a game and save it for later. i need to see what will happen on the next turn, and the next, and the next... the different scenarios keep things fresh. my favorite is the steampunk scenario in the gods & kings expansion.",27.4
"absolutely fantastic, addictive game. it blends the classic likes of sim city with the command & conquer series to deliver an engaging, fun experience that you wont be able to look away from!",337.8
"fastastic game! i have not been disappointed by any game in this series.",11.2
"this game is one of - if not the- best strategy games on steam. its vibrant, exciting, and has near infinite replayability.",158.9
"as you can probably tell, from the number of hours put into this game (550 at time of writing this), i enjoy this game. but then, i do like a good strategy game, and sid meier titles usually deliver on that. civ 5 takes the formula of the first 4 in the series and refines it into a sleek, glossy, next gen-feeling game; civ 4 all grown up, if you will. new civilizations available to play, a plethora of new gameplay and map generation options, a quality soundtrack, revamped multiplayer, and delicious visuals are just the icing on the proverbial cake. however, i do feel that the user mods dont always integrate as well as they should, and the absence of an integrated sdk (like civ 4 had) is lamentable. but hey, nothings perfect.",563.4
"improvement on the definitive civilisation building game. move to hexagonal tiles makes an interesting dynamic.",66.1
"i feel as though the best way to describe this game is risk on steroids",159.2
"excellent game. i guess when something gets as much praise from the community as this game has done and continues to so, its well deserved. perhaps my one complaint is that there are not many shipped scenarios; i personally do not like playing against human opponents (i dont trust my skill all that much, i suppose). for more scenarios one must pay a pretty hefty price for the dlc (which of course, despite the price tag, are worth the money). all in all, 4.5 out of 5.",114.1
"a very good game that lives up to its nickname, just on more turn the game. you can realy loose track of time while playing it. and if your the military type like me, then you will realy enjoy the giant death robots. also caesar is a jerk, kill him first.",69.8
"one of the finest, most addictive releases ever. the core game was lacking, but with the expansion packs, it is the best civilzation game released to date.",226.0
"game sucks.. if you come even close to being a viable civilization, the game will give you  maps and no resources.. typical sid meyers game. i played 2 and loved it, played 3 and burned it in fireplace. skipped 4 and should have skipped 5. oh, i should add i have played games since my first one, the bards tale on my old ibm with no ram, only 2 7 flopies. lot of games have gone by the board since then and i played a lot of hours on useless ones and fun ones. other than master of orion 2 and civ 2, the sid meyer games have been by far the worst games i have ever played.",405.3
"this series is still the only one that makes me absolutely loose track of time. if you like 4x games at all this is a more than worthy addition to the civ series.",55.9
"good game, when i start a game i cant stop, kinda addicting.",292.2
"amazing game, makes you feel like youre actually experiencing history!",66.8
"a little bird told to me: go! go, socialize, talk to those fine leaders! and then kill every last one of them, drop the nukes into their lands when they are not looking and then burn their cites to the ground!!! well that silly, isnt it? hahahahahahahahah...",235.6
"sooooo many hours poured into this game, ive forgotten what the sun looks like",454.8
"i think this games is what it is and isnt what it isnt. this game is a strategy game that you can get lost in for hours. the charators are very well do and the game just feels complete. you really cant go wrong buying this game. however, if you want a game that will put you on the edge of you seat this is not the game for you. this game moves slow and nothing really happens quickly. for example it takes at lease 7 turns to take a city. but this game does what it does so well i think its worth ever cent.",71.5
"great game. very indepth andd quite extensive research trees. by far the best civ yet.",16.8
"its like drugs in game form. superbly easy to get addicted to, insanely hard to quit and uncanningly easy to fall back into if you somehow managed to quit (its like gravity, all it takes is a push). on top of that, its extremely detrimental to your health and social life. 10/10, would give up life again.",252.8
"this game is amazing! it is for sure my favorite strategy game of all time! the options of what you want to do with your empire is unlimited, you can conquer the world with an iron fist or let the arts flourish among your people. some things i would want to change but nothing you cant fix with a mod or two. i would definitely recommend this game.",121.3
"one of the most frustrating games i have ever played. but in a good way.",66.1
"outstanding. wish the deplomacy was as good as older versions. ; )",449.5
"a great example of where pc gaming excels. this game caters to everyone and their respective styles of play. also fun for single and multiplayer - a must have.",146.8
"i have one thing to say about this game..... nukes",54.1
"this game is absoulutely amazing. in singleplayer, the game is very immersive and you feel like a leader of your naton, eager to lead your civilization to glory. and in multiplayer, this game is full of diplomacy, betrayal, forged alliances and secret deals that make the game an absolute laugh. my only complaint is that even on quickest game speed, a full game with friends will take you several weeks to complete and unless you and all your friends are completely dedicated, you will likely get bored before game end. if you like these kind of turn based stratergy/nation builder kind of games and have a group of friends who do too, get this game for sure.",258.4
"hell yea  dis go hard as hell flocka i will suck big  team  all day and week month year and century i love big naps d i c k s q u a d",316.2

"not only do i learn something new everytime i play, but i cant stop playing!",372.2
"an exciting strategy game with endless randomly generated map that will give you hours of fun gameplay. a game full of action and entertainment that lets you build an kingdom from the dawn of human existance. civilization is a great pastime for those who desire to be the leader of a thriving empire which can stand the test of time.",123.1
"i cant even count how many times i said id play a short game of civilization v and landed up staying up all night! its just that addicting.",47.6
"awesome strategy game. reccomended to anyone who wants to create their own empire from nothing and then nuke the  out of ghandi.",74.3
"ok so great game ive had it before and thought why not get again on steam however i was not going to pay 30$ for a game that i bought 2 years ago for the same price so while i was at game stop last night buying an xbox game for my daughter i saw civs v sitting there all alone by itsself and a big shiny price tag of 7.49$ so i figured well damn if i can buy it for that price why cant everyone else dont get me wrong the game is soo worth 30$ but why pay more going to gamestop and buying a digital copy for steam saved me 22$ just thought i would pass this info on enjoy ur games have fun",28.1
"today is civ 5 the best turn-based strategy on the market. especially when you have both major dlcs - gods & kings and brave new world. it has literally everything - epic battles, diplomatic schemes, spying, relgious conflicts, exploring never the same maps and the right feeling that you are the real emperor leading your nation to the greatness.",425.4
"this is such a good 4x game, although nostalgia keeps from ranking it higher than civ4. definitely worth the purchase.",115.4
"ive played this game so much that i feel obliged to make a review of it. civ v is absolotely amazing. its the best strategy game ive ever played. if youre new to civ, start with this game. this game, plus expansion packs and mods, is one of the best gaming experiences ive ever had. if you want recommended mods, message me. once you start playing, you wont be able to stop.",595.2

"if the bible is the greatest story ever told then this is the greatest game ever played. the game is great although waiting for a 75% sale is sugested as for any game, although for 20 its still a great price. the game becomes better with more freinds, playing multiplayer is no hastle just create a lobby and invite them! dlc is recomended but not initialy as it takes a while to learn the concepts of the game and dlcs add alot more features. i would definitely recommend for any of my friends. prawn156.",115.6
"a very fun game. i can spend hours and hours of enjoyment on a single game (set to the fastest settings)",158.3
"this game is a great simulation strategy. it keeps you on your heels and doesnt get boring!",36.3
"one does not simply play just 1 hour of this. itll ruin your life 11/10",28.9
"ive now played civilization v for a year and i both enjoy and have things i dislike this game for. as a whole the game is nothing more than a significant concept. the depth of the game isnt that deep but the spirit of the original shines in this game. with a community and steam-workshop the game has unlimited content for free. its a must buy for those that likes to relax and play, i wouldnt recommend to play this with someone else but its a good option nonetheless. everytime this game gets highlighted i come back to it and play some more, like now. its out on linux/steamos and i am playing some more because of it. its a game you easily forget but a game you easily come back to as well.",387.4
"just the right level of complexity. beautiful and amazing.",158.2
"honestly this is one of the best strategy games out there, i love the style and their attention to details when it comes to the different playable factions. the music is absolutely fenomenal and the graphics are great, maybe not crysis, but its great for what kind of game this is. asbolutely recommended for anyone who loves strategy games which involve more than just warfare. an important thing to note is that if youre looking for an rts like c&c or starcraft 2, then go somewhere else, this is turn based, just like it should be.",71.1
"very enjoyable for hours of fun (literally). i only played this game yesterday and today, i already have 5 hours on it! i like strategy games, but this has to be my favorite yet. i have civilization iii (and enjoyed it), but this is even more fun with enhanced graphics and techniques. i havent tried online yet, but i am going to stick with single player for now.",9.0
"very good game 10/10. everytime i want to quit or even pause for a moment i always say one more turn and turns out to be 50 more. go buy if you dont have it already!",28.1
"first of all i am a huge fun of the game since the very first cilivization ... now about ver v : graphics look good - but the game is so complicated and the controls are so hidden that if i didt already know the shortcuts i would have missed on half the option!!! panthen->religion->paths.. so many govermnet types with so so many different options ... already tired explaining ..bye",172.3
"i like the game a lot. it is very entertaining to me because i love seeing famous ancient people going to war, being my friend, or going to space. especially the older civs that got wiped out or changed to a different culture/name like the aztecs, its funny to see them go to space or shoot guns. overall, the game is a wonderful experience. i definetely got my moneys worth.",113.8
"vary good game with there were better dlc but the game is fun to play",149.2
"this is a good strategy-turnbased game were you start as a great leader of a civilization. even though it is a very good game by it self i would recomend getting th expansion pack brave new world as it adds lots of new and interesting content",31.3
"it is a great game that has a great ambiance and a lot to learn despite it being simplified for newer people to civ. however, it will waste your life when you realize that youve been spending 5 hours straight on one game.",196.2
"my mum came home with this instead of theif, and i was really dissapointed. now, i cant stop playing! it keeps you hooked with its many different aspects of playing, and no two games are the same.",75.2

"best time sink ever. i spend way more time than i playing it than i should. can not recommend any higher.",217.6
"i will never get sick of this game. recently featured on npr as a game adults should play.",499.8
"sid meiers civ 5 is a great game for people who enjoy playing strategy games and trying to out play their opponents while the multiplayer is a bit glitchy at times with large amounts of people its still very enjoyable to be a part of all in all the game is very worthwhile to play or at least check out.",212.4
"good game, as can be expected from any evolution in the series. but the excitement is very much slowing. one huge hole in this game is the terrible networking options, with no ability to play co-op with friends against the ai. overall some enjoyment can be had here, but i expect much more from this series.",667.0
"like 4x games? dont know what they are? probably wont enjoy this. i like them though!",2.8
"while i enjoyed civ iv, civ v is much more the just one more turn addiction im familiar with from the original game. the change to hex from grid makes a huge change in gameplay and city planning, and is a welcome addition. culture as a tech tree adds another dimension to the game and i find myself caring much more about diplomacy than ever before. if theres any real gotcha with civ v, its the design updates from firaxis. while i can appreciate trying to improve the overall play, theyve made significant modifications to game elements since launch that have changed the game. this is the kind of development mentality that can anger a playerbase--its not something an mmo company would take so lightly. beyond that, im heading towards 300 hours over the first year and plan on playing many hours more.",832.6
"this game is awesome! both multipalyer and singleplayer are great. you can play online with teams of friends. and also help each other out by sharing and trading! in single player you can do that too, but not as easily, they have to be your ally. this is a great game that i recommend truly. one of my favorites.",211.6
"im not usually a turn-based game player, but i really like this one",116.5
"its like youre playing god, but more sadistic and warmongering.",214.1
"it is the best stragity game i have ever played, it looks so good, plays soooooo well, and the best part is that there is more that one way to win, makeing it mandatory to keep up the every thing(i have some problems with that). it is a must buy",82.9
"maybe just one more turn.... mmmm just one more. wait why is it 4 in the morning now.",115.2
"this might be one of the finest games ive played, and i dont get sick of it, even that i have played it a long time with no stop. mostly fun with friends, but also fun alone, since all the rounds you play are different. so this is a 9.5/10.",322.8
"a very good strategic game but requires a lot of patience and time. gripping adventure to conquer nations in peaceful or war ways. a must have for strategic awe.",9.3
"very addictive, 34 hours logged in 3 or 4 sessions. gandhi nuked me 10/10 would play again.",57.2
"if you like games like civ (age of empires..vs) you need to try this game. this game is awesome. 10/10",5.3

"its the comprehensive startegy game, if you havent already played it, slap yourself in the face then buy it. you wont regret it (the game that is, you may regret the slap in the face)",163.1
"in civilization v the game play is simply amazing. its short, sweet, and simple graphics allows the player to focus on the strategy aspect of the game and not so much the exploring aspect; yet it still allows the player to see beautiful scenery. 5/5",4.6
"this game in very many ways feels unfinished. most parts of the tutorials & guides seem to fall short. there are parts at which multiple voice overs play at the same time. i appreciate them shaking up core mechanics of the civ series, but dont appreciate it in an unfinished game",68.3

"best time sink ever ! no rly, just one more turn. prices of single addons and dlcs can simply be considered as greedy",76.4
"have been playing for years and have never got bored of it, it is a must buy!!",268.9
"i would like to recommend this game, however steam is useless and does not allow it to be played for me anymore. steam does nothing to solve this problem. firaxis does nothing to solve the problem so i would not suggest this game as these two companies suck gargantuan p3n15s instead of supporting the game and servers on which the game is run.",481.1
"great game. a lot of hours you will spend in building, making war, diplomacy and management.",17.7
"die hard civilization fan here so the only thing i can complain about is the inflated price of the dlc packs, i really want the new brave new world dlc but 30 bucks for 1 dlc is kinda ridiculous especially with civ6 scheduled to be released next year. i already bought the game and all dlc available seperately, so i have already spent more on this game than the price of the combo. on top of that i didnt get some scenario games with some of the earlier dlc and a few of the civs, i tried steam and civ support and they each blamed the other and ended up giving up after fruitless hours of customer service. awesome game but the support sucks from steam.",506.9

"the best, most addicting turn based rts, city builder and mass empire controlling game ever! if you liked civ iv youll really love this. although you pretty much have to have dlc to play multiplayer matches because most people playing have all dlc, but playing with your friends is great if you all cant pay for dlc or whatever :) graphics: 7/10 gameplay: 9.5/10",53.3
"this is a fantastic game that moves at the pace you want it to go at. you can shorten games or make them longer (i perfer the longer games) and you choose what happens to the people in your civilization.",20.5

"i love everything about this game except how to long it takes to get achievements.",259.2
"its a fun game. definitely sucks you in and you wont know how much time goes by when youre playing. if youre looking for something fast-paced this is not your game. if youre looking for a solid strategy game with tons of different playstyles then you should definitely try it out. the dlcs and mods also add quite a bit to the game if you get bored of vanilla.",590.7
"you cant play online unless you buy all the dlc, bad game. that is all.",1.1
"it is one of my favorites that challenges more that just a conquoring battling but stationing religion and also city assitance besides just yours.",145.4

"my favorite game of all time. i have wasted alot of my life playing this, so you can trust me when i say its good.",322.4
"ludicrously good game. but somehow manages to not be as good as previous installments. i love the game, but it feels somehow dumbed down.",161.4
"i was a civ virgin going into v and have to say it didnt matter one bit - the design of this game makes it a pleasure to play for hours and hours and hours on end. but it has got some dodgy ai especially if you choose to be more aggressive in your world building with enemies seemingly appearing from nowhere or having an unfair advantage. if youre interested in strategy and want an engaging and fun experience then try this!",46.7
"insanely addicting game.. and you can get it and the gods & kings xpac for cheaper via my gamefanshop than you can buy just civ 5 for on steam. the codes you get via my gamefanshop work on steam as well, here is the link:",57.7

"super addicting. ive never played a game more than this one.",1066.4
"just doing this for the badge. im terrible at this game, but its pretty dope.",3.5
"this is a game for everyone. it is so very addicting in the combinations of playing with each character. additionally, changing the definitions of a cultural victory has increased the game length because there are no more quick and easy culture wins. the addition of trade routes make barbarians just that more annoying.",111.0
"one of the most fun games i have ever play 10 out of 10 would buy again",92.2

"i cant believe how good and addicting this game is. i tried to play freeciv in the past and never got how people could think that was addicting, but civ v solved my main issue with it: theres too much to handle, but civ v forces me to handle everything before ending my turn. and gosh, im playing with d. pedro ii!",44.6

"this game is awesome. got it for $10 when it went on sale with all the expansions and stuff. great buy!",16.9

"before you purchase civ 5 weigh the pros and cons--- cons- -your job may be lost, from lack of productivity due to day dreaming of civ5, or worst case, youll be fired for job abandonment. -your pets may die from starvation, unless they are resourceful and can find an alternative food and water source. -your sex life may suffer, unless youve already gone celibate, or have a partner that also plays civ and will indulge you by the computer(yea right) -you will lose friends (diplomatic friendships in game dont really count) -you will see hexs in your sleep -bathing and personal hygiene are no longer priorities -getting good grades -going outside and seeing the sun(can be supplemented by vitamin d) -using your legs. if these things dont bother/offend/apply to you, then yes immediatly purchase and play.",33.2

"i love turn based strategy games and this is one of the best without containing too much detail like some of the other games. these type of games are great for those who are looking to be able to walk away from the game at a moments notice without any problem (except if playing multiplayer).",418.1
"this is my first time playing a game in this series, and i throughly enjoy it. its great fun to play alone, but it shines when you play with and against your friends in multiplayer! it does take some time to get used to how it works, however there are many strategies at your disposal. i would suggest this to strategy game players, but it can be fun for others as well. a well-made enjoyable game! great game!",94.4

"strategy in its finest. this game is the flagship of the turn-based strategy genera. whether you are into strategy or not, the game offers many simple to complex options to lead your own civilization to endure the test of time. wage war, diplomacy, discoveries and many other tasks await those that want to build the most powerful civilization the world has ever known.",360.0
"this game is great for all kinds of players. for those that like to be a war mongering leader, to those who want to out class their opponents in technology, and even for the peace lover who wants to win by diplomacy or culture. with all the expansions there are so many choices for civilizations and ways to play, the replay value is amazing. i love to personally play team games with my frineds online, but the options for freestyle single player or situation games makes this a game that i cant get enough of.",333.8
"the game franchise speaks for itself. so, there is not much to add. for me, the best thing in civ is that i am never tired of it. i mean. sometimes i want to play something else, but after a few days or weeks i can play it again, as it was yesterday that i bought it. it fun for a long long time and so, buying it was well spent money.",390.4

"400 hours and only 50% achievements... this game is nuts! still loving it.",473.0
"lots of fun. i dont have any words to describe, besides my total of 180 hours of gameplay on it. its one of those games where you always want to come back to later. once you get used to the game you can up your difficulty, play with your friends on multiplayer, try out a scenerio, and download loads of community made mods. besides this, you can also make mods as well, something i find cool is the map maker, where i can play around designing maps for myself for future custom gameplays. 10/10, 5 stars best game.",244.4

"made my friends pay me gold in return for not nuking them as japan. 1945/10",82.8
"i wont lie, after playing civ iv, i miss stacking an army of units and sending them all on one space to crush my opponents. and i miss not being buddhist, because spain would always get buddhism, and then they would hate everyone who wasnt buddhist, but they wouldnt let them become buddhist, so i had a really great excuse to convince everyone to destroy spain. i kind of miss tech trading, but i remember thinking that was a cheap way to become all-powerful. other than that, this is an amazing game.",84.9
"fantastic game. truly the best top-down strategy game out there so far. i didnt like strategy games until i came across this beauty. 4.5/5 stars.",62.1

"sid meiers civilation v is a very addicting turn-based game. once you start it keeps you busy for the next two hours at least, the multiplayer feature makes you play for hours on end with your friends. what i really like about this game are the plenty amount of characters and countries you can choose from, not only do you get to play as gandhi or queen elizabeth, but everyone has got their own perks so choose wisely. your opponent also has thier own personalities which makes the game more fun to play. also, this game does not only provide fun, but you can learn from it too. its not a simpel game either, it requires tactics and a lot of thought. the visuals are simply amazing.",24.2

"the civ series has always been great. the changes that come with civ 5 are, especially hex map and no unit stacking, are massive improvements over previous entries. that being said, i feel that the dilomatic options and resource trading possiblities of civ 4 are superior to civ 5. still a fantastic game that leads the turn-based strategy genre.",675.5

"washington is a f**king a** during every game. 10/10-would nuke",94.9
"this is a great game, and a great addition to the civilization saga. i have spent many days playing solo and with my friends, and will spend many more in the future. if you are a fan of stratagy games/ rule the world games then civilization v is for you. with many different ways that you can win this game has something for everyone. you can win a scientific/space race victory, a diplomatic victory through votes in the un, cultural victories, and of course you can just pound your enemies into the ground under the boots of your soldiers. the unique units/buildings as well as the special perks that each nation recieves makes this game interesting no matter who you play as. all in all i would give this a two thumbs up rating and now i think i might start playing myself.",391.9

"played for 10 minutes at night and realise its already in the morning what?",15.4
"this game is awesome. you can be a noob and still have fun and dominate or be crushed. even though this game was released in 2010 it is still one of the most amazing sid meies games to play. i am very glad i got this on sale. 10/10",12.5
"if you even somewhat like strategy, then you will most deffinitally love this one. there is always something different everytime you play you will never have two games alike. making this game very easy to play again and again.",336.9

"excellent graphics and smoothly transitions between turns. definitely stays tue to the civilization brand!",35.9
"loved every minute of it. never trust gandhi. never.",197.4
"fun game, though there are some features that are just annoying, or seem relatively useless. perhaps just because i dont understand everything about that feature yet.",115.0
"great turn-based strategy game. highly recommended.",138.8
"ive wasted days with this game. get it and enjoy ruling the world.",2.9
"great game and definately very happy, as always from the civ franchise. the new features are definately a great addition to the franchise and the dlcs definately dont disappoint either! definately worth a buy.",238.6

"civ v is the most addicting game ive ever played. its the most intense, and deep strategy game ive ever played.",240.3

"great game. this is a game that i will keep playing for years.",123.7
"it really doesnt get better than this for a civilization management game. with the two expansions you have unlimited options for play style. ive easily sunk more than 600 hours into this game and i keep coming back. tons of mods in workshop also help keep things fresh as well and the community support is unlike any other game out there. i cant recommend this enough. look out for fredrich the great. he lies.",725.9
"as someone new to the civilization franchise, i cant compare this game to the previous installment like most veterans do. however, on its own, i found civ 5 to just be okay. without any of the expansions it seems like there are some things that could have been better (the tech tree, culture, and diplomacy to name a few). does that mean this game is bad? i sure dont think so, its just okay. with gods and kings, certain features are fixed, while others are fixed in brave new world. if you are considering this game, you should probably go for the complete edition (maybe when on sale).",134.3
"10pm: its getting late, i should probably think about logging off 11pm: ill just settle this dispute and then ill get to bed 3am: just...one...more...turn",417.6
"woke up at 8am, booted up civ5 and before i knew it, it was 3am! 10/10, would reccomend for added time machine capabilities.",158.0
"this game is a very fun, unpredictable, learning experience of a game. the graphics are great during leader scenes and are either rough or smooth during the main game depending on your graphics card. the game takes a while to learn the more complicated portion of the game. your civilization is completely based on what you make it whether you want a strong military or lots of farms. i myself have both. i hope this review has convinced you to buy sid meiers civilization 5!",30.6

"i love this game first civilization and love it cant wait for beyond earth!",17.8
"this game can make you forget that free time has other uses. it is an incredibly addictive strategy game that takes away large portions of your life. a single game can take over eight hours to finish (on the standard speed, it can be set to go faster or much slower), so this isnt a game for the impatient. since its turn-based you can also easily do other things while playing, making it good for multi-taskers, though playing so casually will extend the already lengthy game times. i highly recommend both the gods & kings and brave new world expansions, as they both add a variety of new and interesting mechanics to keep each game unique. there are some issues, mostly with the multiplayer; mods are not supported in multiplayer - no matter how little they change the game - and the ai becomes much less interactive and therefore much more boring during multiplayer games.",210.2
"ive been a fan of civ since civ 4 which i know isnt long but nonetheless civ is still one of the best strategy games ive played and probably always will be. i would highly recommend it.",31.1
"play this far too much! love it, always have. plenty of detail, gameplay. graphics as you would expect. the whole game is nicely polished but what i love the most is the amount of mods and stuff available in the workshop, pretty much change the whole game. 9/10 (looking forward to the next installment)",383.0
"not much to say. amazing game and really hard to put down. gets only better when you have lots of friends to play with. is very time consuming and one game can last hours.",220.7
"an absolutely addictive game that will keep you entertained for many hours. build up your civilisation as you expand into new territories, making friends and foes alike. using its simple turn-by-turn basis, your actions will shape the future of your empire. there are many ways to win, and that is the beauty of this game - there is no set path you have to take. if youre the type of person that likes to wage war on others then you can win by military strength. if you prefer more peaceful ways, you can win by achieving a cultural victory. or if youre keen on winning via scientific means, be the first to have the parts needed for space exploration.",182.8
"civ has always been a game i have found complex to pick up and try. i tried civ iii a while back and didnt get deep into it without feeling lost and gave up. as hesitant as i was to pick up civ v im glad i did. im a big rts fan, so i was worried about the pace of this game. needless to say, i love this game. so many civs to play as, it just adds to the replay value to me. its fun from start to finish, from no tech to full tech. if youve never given this game or any of the civ games a try but youre into strategy, i cannot recommend this game enough. lots of fun. and now im craving to play it. i hope youre happy.",353.6
"honestly can say of all turn based games i highly recommend this to be the best. not to mention the dlc has so much potential and adds a lot to the game play.",129.5
"this is a game for people who love tatical thinking, a diverse series of options and ways to win a game, complete control and spreadsheets! it is a fantastic game that just keeps you wanting to play one more turn.",141.6
"if you like strategy and changing the past, then youll love this game. go for complete package so you dont have to spend 50 more dollars.",104.8
"i guess its ok but theres nothing really noteable about it",366.1
"i like this game a lot. however, i wouldnt really recommend people to pay 30 dollars for it. its quite fun at first, but into the game you start to see it begin to be repetitive. you start out each new game the same way. also, if youre going for a conquest victory, dont. its insanely easy to pull off, as all you really have to do is get enough tech to outmatch your enemies, and then blow them out. in addition to being easy, its also very annoying to move individually your 30 units into position. i dont find it very satisfying to blow up an entire city in 3 hits anyway.",86.8
"best world domination game yet! my max pay price: $15... with expansions: $20",74.6
"my butt plug really enjoys this games, it makes fredrick (the butt plug) really happy.",208.2
"this is definitely one of the best strategy games that i ever played. its dlcs expand the contents of the game dramatically and make the game worthy playing again and again to try different strategies. one thing still need to be improved is ai takes too much time every turn in late game, especially when aircraft comes out.",255.3
"buy this game and you wont pay for a week of your life! dont let this special offer go away!",38.6
"just one more turn. that is what is going to happen if you play this - actually, no, dont even try it. this game is great, everytime there are sales i feel temptated to go around giving it to people and watching them get sucked into being addicted to it. game had its downsides when it was vanilla, but hole cow batman, its great now - if you have free time and think what a log knows is worth to heed, youll play the hell out of this!",418.8

"a great way to spend a lot of time on a strategy game. first time playing a civ game and it was very easy for me to get into and understand after a few playthroughs. the achievements for this game definitely give me something to play for, as well. highly recommend!",119.7
"whew! after a few fun hours its time to turn this off and go to bed. whats that? its time to get up already!? yeah. it happens. with all of its dlc, 50 hours is only scratching the surface. its addicting, its exciting, and its challenging. playing with friends in to the early morning is a common occurence as you to try to out-perform and out-maneuver your opponents. its satisfying when you emerge victourious after an 8 hour game. (lets ignore the disappointment of being defeated after 8 hours). this game is well worth your money as there are many hours of fun to be had. also, the music is pretty darn good.",48.2

"game is really fun and well worth the money because of the amount of time you will spend on this game. the game is turn base so if you hate these kind of games i will not recommend it for you.",819.1

"i have invested more hours into this game alone than all my other games combined... i need a life.",409.9
"a little different to civ iv, but easy to get the hang of. all in all a thoroughly good game. it will nab your free time though, so make sure you keep an eye on your watch! if you enjoyed civ iv, you should enjoy this just as much.",372.4
"this game is the . easily one of my favorites. if you like slowly crushing your enemies and then dropping nuclear missiles on the waste of their civilization, you might like this game. or if youre a resource . or a world wonder . or a . point is, if you buy and play this game, you will no longer have friends, a job, or go to school. and it is worth it.",566.9

"civilization 5 is the greatest human achievement ever. the massive free roam world is so large i feel like its a different map everytime i play! the leveling system is kinda strange. i cant figure out how to spend my skill points. civ 5 has a great story which will compel gamers to continue playing. i personally have over one hour of gameplay. civ 5 contains many new aspects which its predecessor lacked. i love the fact that they added new killstreaks to replace chopper gunners. after beating the complex storyline, i decided to take my skills online. i loved the new killstreak system which they added. i was level 36 in no time. (fun fact: 36 is a perfect square) my only problem with the game is the fact that austria is not as strong as it should be. please fix this in the next update. only recommended for people with cargo. (sorry yali) this game is the reason i wake up in the morning.",586.9
"great game. constantly has me saying, just... one... more.. turn!",132.6
"sid meiers civilization v is beautifully designed. ive only played civ iii before this installment, so i have little to compare it to, but civ v feels much more real than civ iii, and compared to civ iii, it is much easier to get to grips with. one of my favourite features is the ability to construct various wonders, and trying to be the civilisation with the most wonders. gods and kings is a fairly good expansion, but adds very few readily seen features. brave new world functions well as making the late game far more interesting, introducing a far more complex diplomacy system, as well as the overhauled culture system (now with added tourism).",365.5
"this game is surprisingly adictive. the first time i played it with some friends of mine we started at about 8pm my time. we played for a while and before i knew it, it was 3am! great game!",122.9

"this is the best strategy game that i have played on pc. it is fun to play against a.i. or with friends. you will have to expect some games to last up to 10 to 15 hours although you can adjust things to make the games shorter. 8.5/10",24.6

"the greatest strategy game ive ever played. possibly the best game ive ever played.",558.9
"its civilization, what more do you really have to say? in any event, this is the most polished and entertaining game in the seires. the fact that its cross platform and runs like a dream with an intel hd 4600 gpu on linux helps a lot too. i cant recommend this game enough. hell if you get around to actually playing it, not only will you have fun, you might actually learn something!",16.2

"games take 20 hours, where did my 20 hours go....give them back",329.0
"great game overall, if you like turn-based stradegy games, this game is a great pick. though it has some major problems in multiplayer, its worth buying all the way up to the brave new world expansion. i also recommend getting beyond earth (the future civ vi game) when it comes out, if you like a game like this. ~moretti",325.2
"this game wins at expansions. the base game is great as-is, and each expansion adds new mechanics and content that make it feel almost like a brand new game. definitely worth the money.",182.2
"this game is awesome. i started out on civ 2 years ago, and have been a fan of the series ever since. in my opinion, civ 4 had quite a bit more customizing you could do, but the enhanced gameplay mechanics of civ 5 more than make up for it. any fans of the xbox port civilization: revolutions would be thrilled with all the additions they will find in civ 5. all around, this is a great civ game that is only made better with the various dlc packs and the gods & kings expansion.",611.5
"this game is the best.i thought who the heck would want to play a game with turns but when i played i loved it so much it kept me hours on end with so much stuff to it you dont have to play civ 4,3,2,1 just play civ 5 and you will have fun and get brave new world dlc it would make it more fun",116.9

"a different game from civ4, its finally starting to grow on me. leaner in some ways, more tactical in others. still feels as if it suffers from consolitis in that many power-user controls and options are missing (hello, can we get an in-game clock at least?). gods & kings expansion is a must.",404.2
"lots of replay value. worth the money and dlc. watch out for gandhi.",180.5
"this game is a huge timesink. once, i woke up one morning and started playing this game, and the next time i looked at the clock, it was already nighttime. if you can get into the game mechanics and how everything works, you will seriously lose hours to this game and enjoy every second of it. while it is a turn-based game, please do not let that deter you from how great this game is. buy this game asap if you enjoy strategy.",206.5

"i have to admit that i never thought i would like this game. i was a die hard civ iii fan (and i still love it). but this game is gorgeous and has some great things about it. i found the hex grid hard to get used to, but after getting used to it, its much more intuitive than civ iiis grid. i actually like the fact that i cant stack a hundred things on top of one another (though ive heard people complain about that) because i keep track of my units better that way. one thing i really dont like is the extra restrictions on movement. you cant even go through an enemys space at all, even to pass through and you ship cant risk dangerous deep water (a gambit i am very fond of in civ iii). other than that, i love this game. it may even be my favorite out of the civilization games.",206.8
"i like just keeping to myself and having large cities until i take up most of the space then i expand my military just in the off chance im attacked. im usually able to go without a war and win in another way. 10/10 you should play",66.2

"i think this game is really good when you play with a lot of your friends. i find it fun to warmonger early game and just continue, especially against ai. but playing with friends prevents this since they can all gang up on you and since ai are predictable, i think that it will be a challenge to have the same play style as when play ai.",28.8
"its been quite a while since i last played civ iv. i frickin love that game, but my disc went walkabout and then i had to have it declared mia. with the lovely summer sales going on, i decided to give civ v a try. i have totally not been disappointed. its still early days for me, but im loving what ive seen so far. i thought i would be more frustrated with the changes theyve made in this version, but luckily ive found it to be a refreshing challenge. go buy it while its still on sale. if you like strategy turn-based games... youll just need to be within reach of food and drink for hours and youll be set.",279.2

"i absolutely love civ 5. its an easy, fun, and highly addictive game. with 85 hours in, and many more planned in the future, the game does not fail to ever get boring. for strategy players, if you like strategy, this is your game, without a doubt.",102.5

"as a pretty casual gamer, i was not expecting to enjoy a game as serious as civ v starting out. however, with a couple friends to help negotiate the steep learning curve of 4x games like civ v, i was able to understand the game mechanics and enjoy it! i got caught quickly in one-more-turn syndrome, and as a result have actually gained a better appreciation of history, geography, and psychology! i recommend this game to anyone who enjoys critical thinking and has some friends to help them along.",147.2

"civ v is the quintessential time waster of a strategy game. i believe this is a good thing. this game allows your brain to focus on many different things, without feeling lost. the customization with what type of game you wish to play is phenominal. the dlc really adds to the experience. after your first game, youll be an expert thanks to the training system! go out and conqur the world +graphics +sound +gameplay +ease of use +tutorial -length (its an rts, what do you expect?) -online play",81.8

"civ v is a solid game, but really needs the brave new world exansion. never before has an expansion so revitalised a game! the combat mechanics and victory conditions took a while to get used to coming from civ iv, but in the end are a very nice change, i do not miss the wars of who has the biggest unit stack?",174.3

"this is one of my all time favorite games. its a strategy came, but since you play in turns and not time, theres no stress. and its not the type of game where you do the same things over and over again. there are several ways to win, several ways to play, so you dont get bored right away. i just love it!",125.5

"game is pretty well done. the ai could use some work though",204.2

"must have for every civilization fan! great turn-based game which mixes classic civ-approach with some new features like hex instead of square fields and more tactical approach in battles. if you want to try it i have to warn you - have a lot of hours prepared, because it is really time-eating game!",322.7

"another civilization. quality strategy game, but yeah, its still much of the same thing so if youre burnt out on the typical civ-take-over-the-world gameplay, you may want to try something different. its been a few years since i played a civ game so i dont know if this was implemented in civ4 and i dont remember it, but i really like the new mechanics for religion and diplomacy. espionage too is much more fair. i bought the gold edition so i get to play as a civilization that is sometimes shunned -- the vikings! another terrific civilization. if you played the older verisons, youll learn quickly. if youve never played civilization, youre missing out. maybe the best turn-based strategy series ever designed exclusively for the pc?",230.0

"this is a fantastic turn-based strategy game that will chew through your time like godzilla through tokyo. the screenshots may look like its a complex game, but its actually a very simple game with a lot of depth. the interface has been polished to such a degree that it keeps pulling you in. anyone willing to give this game 10 minutes of their time will find themselves looking at the clock at 4 am, blinking in disbelief and wondering where the time went (just... one... more... turn!) and the random world generator means that no two games will ever be alike. im not exaggerating when i say that this is one of the greatest games of all time.",504.3

"its different from the previous civ games. not worse, just different. the old ones 1-4, were only really strategically challending, but civ 5 is much more tactically challenging. its still about the overall strategy of where to build cities, when, how and how much you want to expand... but in civ 5, you have to think a lot more about the placement of your troops. i like this change, and if you want to play each eras units in proper wars (and have the time to do so), a marathon length game is quite fun... but its going to take some 50-100 hours to get to the endgame!",244.6

"its a nice turn based strategy game, although honestly the game takes way too much of your time. besides that, the game is full of strategy and a lot to learn, get its easy to jump in and play the game. if you want to be great, youll have to study a bit and play a lot, if you want to have some fun, just play. online game kind of sucks though, sadly.",46.5
"this is a major time sink for me. great to waste your holidays away!",31.4
"pretty much one of the best strategy games of all time.",358.9
"disappointing. the punchline is: its just not fun. i love 4x games, and i do sometimes play civ v, just to get my fix, but even with the newest expansion (brave new world). its not that fun. civ iv is better in almost every way. - interface is clunky. lots of information is hidden. e.g. a research treaty just finished - what did i get out of it? - diplomacy still feels weird. why must all deals be for a fixed period of time? why cant they be indefinate, for as long as you want? and with the ai being such an unreliable partner, playing the game of diplomacy just feels like a waste fo time. - resource usage feels arbitrary. why does a swordsman require iron, but not a submarine? ... and much much more. if youre new to 4x, you may enjoy this game, but if you want a game that makes sense, that is elegant, that balances strategy, complexity, and fun. this isnt it.",127.6
"havent played the civilization-series before i tried the 5th game, and i must say i regret i didnt try it earlier. it takes a little while to get in the gameplay, but its that perfect casual, relaxing and fun difficulity level. as far as i can tell, if you like strategy-games, and want a bit more in-depth than, say, age of empires/wonders, but still not as advanced as europa universalis and such games, this is the perfect game to start when you want to relax and get in to something that takes 10-50 hours.",169.6

"with well over 400 hours, damn right i recommend this game. its slow, methodical, deliberate and turn-based so its not for the fps purist but this game is great for any mood or intention - from a lazy netflix accompaniment to a frustrating challenge, depending on your predetermined difficulty level. there is a moderate learning curve as you begin to balance different aspects of the game, so i stronly suggest you take in the vanilla game first, then begin layering the dlcs in the order they were released, that is: gods and kings religion and brave new worlds new tourism (and culture and diplomacy overhauls) will amount to too many extra things to worry about at first. stick with the core gold, culture, happiness, military worries.",479.6

"i dont think its as good as 4 bu its still fun :) one more click.....",15.9
"this game is incredible. in my opinion it is quite fun as a stand-alone, but it is much more fun in the complete version. when alone the game flies by however it will become boring after extended periods of time. with your friends this game is even more fun as it allows you to enhance the experience by playing against other gamers of your level.",50.1

"this might sound like apocrypha, but when combined with the expansions and dlc, civ v has become my favourite game in the series. the gameplay mechanics and additional civilizations added by the expansions and dlc make it a rich and rewarding experience. i have a particular soft spot for the aesthetic style of the game, which feels like a beautiful board game. ive spent many hours playing this installment and dont regret a second of it.",309.9

"simply an incredibly engrossing game. compared to rival series such as total war, civ 5 is wonderfully accessible; the interface ensures that youll never miss available actions by queueing them, and the at-first complicated map is quickly made understandable thanks to a comprehensive encyclopedia and advisor system. while i cant comment on the accuracy of the language the world leaders speak, they are all visually well represented, having clear, fun animations when you decide to trade with or declare war on them. the soundtrack is suitably evocative of the various world cultures, and a gamut of settings for maps and variables ensures the even if you tire of the unique scenarios or the main game, there is always the option of creating custom matches. strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys historical and/or nation simulation games.",144.0

"this game is so much better than beyond earth! beyond earth isnt that great of a game like this one, my favourite thing about this game is that you go up in ages from a round wheel to space age, but beyond earth its all in the same age with only technological upgrades and the units you get.. well lets just say theres not a lot. prefer this game 10 out of 10 than beyond earth! well lets just wait, the game was only recently released hoefully they will put in a lot more dlc into the game to make it more fun, at least put in more units than just the basic ones. still have no idea how to use the jets yet so complicated or maybe its just glitched out because i cant make them move any where around the map or to hover/guard a tile",13.5
"i played civ ii when i was a 13 years old child, and i still remember these long, sometimes even overnight sessions ;). i skipped civ iii and iv, as i was always feeling of it being the same than before, but then i found civ v on steam winter sale and bought it. and it still feels like in my memories. so one might say that there wasnt much innovation, but when civ wasnt played a long time ago or civ hasnt been played at all this feeling of growing a nation and becoming more and more powerful is still great. and still it produces the same one more round feeling as always before. personally i recommend civ v to everyone who hasnt played civ at all or where it has been a while. for the ones who played iii and iv i have the feeling that its still the same.",16.0
"most of the time i dont know what im doing, which is good cause no one else does either. enjoyable experience but you need to play with friends.",42.3

"judging by how many hours ive played, you know the awnser...",309.9
"amazing strategy game once you figure out the basics of how the game is to be played. can be a bit confusing at first but is a great amount of fun once you play with a few friends. just make sure to set aside a few hours before playing as the games can take a good while to finish. i would rate this game a 8.5/10.",72.1
"i would recommend this game because its a lot more fun and a lot harder than it appears to be. i stumbled across this game for no particular reason and i wouldnt know how to describe it since its really a new experience for me. a lot of people seeing this game for the first time say: so thats like age of empires. i would say yes and a whole lot more than that.",334.5
"okay so every match will take you about 500000 days you cant just step away from the game because then your like one more turn maybe one more for 7 hours then you find yourself failing classes, losing a wife, mising work, and losing electricity but still playing because its infused into your brain.get friends to play with you a lot more fun. you have to buy the complete edition to enjoy this game. if not your missing out on a lot of stuff and the game will be boring without the dlc honestly. god and kings you dont need but it gives you a lot of civilizations.",27.4
"i just baught this last week...should of waited. great game if you enjoy taking hours of your day and turning them into a strategically turn-based time killer.",46.4
"another great addition to the civ library. not quite as polished as civ 4, but once you get the expansions it easily exceeds how great 4 was, even with beyond the sword.",312.7
"although most games (within this game), start out slow, the late game is fun, and too fast. use nukes to destroy armies, and pollute your enemies lands. use killer robots to walk through people. maybe start early and use knights to destroy warriors. the game is very fast for the skilled, and very slow to the beginners. dont let that scare you though, slow beginnings only strengthen you for the quick ending, youd rather fight off.",147.8
"this is a surprisingly enjoyable and highly addictive game. i didnt expect to find it as absorbing as i did, but it is much better tutorialised than previous games in the series, making it more accessible. just... one... more... turn...",100.3

"hands down amazing game, very simple gaemplay, and very very very addicting, must do one more turn!!! is what you will be saying.",819.4
"i could speak volumes about how much ive enjoyed this game, however, ill try to keep it short. 1) this game is the standard by which all 4x games are currently measured 2) this game and skyrim are the highest quality games ive played in my lifetime in terms of pretty much every metric there is. i will give this one the edge on balance over skyrim though. (yes i realize they are 2 separate genres) even if youre not sure how you feel about strategy games i would suggest this one as a great starting point so that at least the frustrations of poor design dont mar your initial experience and you can truly decide for yourself based on the gameplay whether or not you are a strategy fan. i wish more game developers could uphold the standard of quality that civ 5 exhibits.",582.6

"at first, gods and kings was satisfying enough, but then late game began to suffer from a militaristic -focused drive. either you steamrolled or you got steamrolled. but now with brave new world, you can break their trade routes, destory their diplomatic relationships, and strip them of everything they have before claiming their lands.",40.6

"the hexagonal layout and new city defense system refreshes the gameplay and fixes the absurd unit stacking of civ iv. though its not as deep and diverse as civ iv. online mode is bugged and nearly impossible to enjoy which is a major downside. many balance issues and some bugs are fixed via the civilization v unofficial patch (civup) and vanilla enhanced mod (vem). overall its worth giving it a try as there is a demo on steam. its not the successor everybody was waiting for but its a step into the right direction.",24.4

"it took me a while to get used to the whole turn based thing, but now i realize that its addicting as hell and therefore great for the developers, so thumbs up for that. unlike other strategy games ive tried its not that much to organize and gather, which makes it easier to focus on the strategy/occupying land/backstabbing/building armies part  and i guess that deserves a thumbs up as well. and as others already pointed out: beware of gandhi.",32.4
"just one more turn....... if you havent ever played any of the civilization series, then i must recommend you get one of them some time soon. they may seem complicated at first, but with many different ways to win using different strategies, short or long games, different map types, good dlc, many different civs to choose from etc, it is really rewarding in the long run. civilization iv is pretty damn good too. enjoy",520.0
"very good strategy with loads of fun ;) however i need to warn that: - next turn button is bugged; 50% of cases it doesnt do anything, 40% it shows some unit which needs new orders and only at remaining 10% it trully ends turn, - workers forget what they were doing almost every single turn, - game starts up and loads save very slow. other than that its really cool and you probably wont regret buying it ;)",35.2

"great turn-based world builder. different from pervious civilization games - only 1 unit per tile and instead of squares, the tiles are now hexagons. adds some depth. pick up gods + kings while youre at it. adds some great features.",492.8

"i bought this game with all the dlcs in the steam sale and i really like it. i think the game is very clear for beginners, with lots of help-pop ups where you can choose if you want them to pop up next time youre in the same situation or not. i thought that was really nice, because it explains you more about the game mechanics. also every civilisation has their own advantages, which can be helpful during the game. the only downside i found until now is when you play multiplayer, dont make the turns too long, cause some people take forever xd other then that i would really recommand it!",17.2

"best strategy game ive ever played, one of my favorite games ever. mods, scenarios, and different victory types allow for basically endless gameplay. definitely get it if you havent already. the expansions, gods and kings and brave new world, are worth their asking price and make the game much better.",215.7

"this game is amazing, it is fun alone and amazing with friends. :)",311.5
"civ5 is such a great game! bought it retail when i never played a civ game before, and i loved it right away. its only excellent if you have the 2 expansions though, vanilla game was mediocre at best. expansions added a buttload of civs (total of 43, when there were only about 8), each having its own great leader speaking in their native language, making for characters full of personality. there are many mechanics, which i will not list, but i will say that they are very intuitive and you will get the hang of it very quickly, and will understand rapidly which civs have good bonuses (poland, korea, babylon...) and which ones are crap (spain, byzantium...). the music in this game is something that really stuck to me, especially for european civs. this game made me like classical music.",76.8

"played japan and was a war-mongering warlord, then later became a science desired nation. everyone even the city states declared war on me. but its okay because when i have guns and infantry units they have basic warriors. they all sent peace treaties :) i rate 11/10 would laugh my  off again.",9.2
"this is by far the best civilization title bar none. i bought the bundle with all the dlc content and i have enjoyed all the extra maps and civilizations they included. there is no need to look further than civilization v, this game will keep me absorbed for years... i have put in over 300 hours and i do not plan on quiting anytime soon.",387.1

"base game was okay, but with expansions it became soooooooooooo much better.",269.6
"this game is really addicting and well worth the $13.74 cad, keeps you busy and has many options to chose from and more than one way on how to play the game. the complete edition is what i got and its very fun to play. the only annoying parts i see in the game is when you use any nuclear bombs near a mountain the fallout stays there and you cannot use any of the workers to clear it. perhaps theres a mod to get rid of it? i kinda only wished there was more civilizations to pick from when youre setting up the game because with only few to pick some even with the dlcs. it seems like theres a lot more missing that the game could had placed in. this game is one of my most favorite games on steam right now. im glad i got to purchase it when it was only 60-70% off.",103.6

"fun edit: was fun multiplayer has been ruined on oct. 27th by devs latest update. the devs didnt even admit to it untill almost a month later, and only deep in a random forum post. possibly the worst dev teams public relations ever. so well over a month later and no fix yet they sell the game in steam store and make no mention of it. **buyers beware!** this is what you will get when you buy this. multiplayer is broken. so for single players its great fun. *****edit #2 : after a month and a half, quietly they let loose a hotfix for the multiplayer problems they created, very poor customer service, great game though.",653.0

"a really good grand strategy game. although one round takes a long time to finish, i found none of the time taken to be boring. the many civilizations you can choose from to play as makes this game feel new even after many many hours of gameplay. this is highly recommended for those who enjoy a good strategy game.",53.5

"should have bought the goty edition (with all dlc) when it was 7.49 on sale. i didnt. now im playing vanilla waiting for the goty edition to come back own to the same price. the game isnt bad, it just needs more...well more content.",35.6
"im still learning, but i am totally addicted! my husband and i both bought this game to play with our son. love it.",84.8
"be prepared for the game that can take anywhere from 1 hour to about 40 hours. this game has many aspects to it that make it fantastic, and even better with brave new world dlc, like trade routes, tourism, or religion. each civ has a different playstyle, and this grants for a new, refreshing experience every time you play.",131.9

"a perfect continuation to an excellent franchise. it addresses problematic parts of older versions to streamline game play.",169.6
"i refused to buy this game until i played it, and then i realized how much i love being in control. of everything. having so much control can be dangerous, or can be simple and easy. dangerous in a way where all of your peers fear you because you nuked some  country. or simple and easy in a way where you trade your allies, and help them fend off said  country. 10/10 did play.",194.9

"just got into the civ series with this game. as a new civ player, the single player content alone was worth buying the game. civ veterans seem to disagree on this based on other reviews i read. i let my brother try it and he got hooked. i woke up to him still playing the next morning, so i got it for him for and unlike others, we havent seen any multiplayer issues, yet (hopefully this continues). i think its important to note that i found this game looking for a new rts and it is filling the role quite nicely even though it is turn based and not filled with the fast paced battles i am used to. if anything, the slower pace and individuality of each unit makes it more fun than your everyday rts.",261.4
"sick of the game as its keeps crashing 3/4 of the way through game play. not worth the time if its crashes so often which is a shame as it is still a great game",119.7
"ive really liked civ 5 a lot. ive been going around buying a lot of reasonably cheap games recently trying to find something i can really be dedicated to and civ 5 hit me on every intrest level. its a game of politics, economics, war, ideology, and trading. i love all of the historical leaders you can trade with, become allies with, go to war with, or be one of them. i played march of war which made me not a huge fan of turn based games. civ 5 completetly changed my mind bringing a whole new meaning to the term turn-based for me. the only thing i would really say was bad in this game is the multiplayer. i strongly advise you just make a game with freinds and organize it if you want to have a successful online game. if you want to just play with anyone you want then it will probably crash or people will quit. overall this game is a 9/10",210.1
"goty!!! this game is amazing! worth the money, improved a lot with the dlcs, this game should be on everyones wishlist! 5/5!",80.3
"base game has large amount of content and is very good. brave new world dlc added new breath of life into a game that was staring to get a bit boring, would reccomend buying after getting a feel for the game.",102.7
"this game is great. its a fun addicting way to waste time. it, however, does have some flaws. the a.i.s dont exactly act the way people would and lots of the later game units are really gimicky and unbalanced. luckily, they created expansions to the game to amend their past mistakes. its kind of a puss-out to make the dlc include civilizations instead of just releasing all of them with the game, but it makes up for it with new play styles, scenarios, and feel for the game. on its own, the game is a 6.5/10. with the dlc (especially brave new world), i becomes a 9.3/10. for any fan of the strategy genre, i highly recommend this game. have fun!",198.0

"taken a lot of pleasure from civilization v and its two expansion. however, i do not recommend the base version without both the gods&kings and brave new worlds expansion packs, they greatly improve balancing and general game play this is a conditional thumbs up",1065.8
"love the game! but as of recently, the game will not load previous saves really disappointed...",193.6
"very nice game, easy to understand. strategy is very important here, but theres a little of adventure too. with new dlcs it is much funnier to play! you can win the game in some different ways, personally i always won with science victory. with the workshop contents, it is more interesting, but most of the addons require dlcs. soometimes it can be buggy. 8,5/10",119.2

"very good stradegy game. highly recommended, good for newcomers to the series.",89.7
"this game is a infinity/10 rating. this game is rather good for those who love turn-based strategy, other things about this game may be: inability to sleep, planning to destroy ghandi. inability to focus during the day due to the constant thinking of nuking back ghandi. last but not least, inability to get off the screen until you notice its like 8 am and youve been playing since yesterday at 5 pm. buy it! you will never sleep again! :d",263.4

"this is an awesome game. after playing since civ 3 all the way to civ 5 each one expanded the depth of the game becoming more realistic. now trying out civ beyond earth.. the game makes you think and will take up your free time.",595.1
"this game is somewhat enjoyable, but with its frequent crashes (just about every 5 minutes) and multitude of bugs, i would call it a waste of money. also, the steam forum for this game is full of people saying that they are experiencing these crashes. it may have something to do with windows 8.1.",25.5
"basically one of the best strategic games known on pc. its vast choices of civilizations past and present to play as, different ways of achieving victories; this game is a good 8/10! i fell in love with this game the first time i layed my eyes of its gameplay and scenarios on youtube. although i would reccomend more scenarios, this game is a great game. 8/10. for strategy game lovers, this is a game you would enjoy!",159.8

"this is the most incredable game ever! every time i play it a get addicted to the piont where my mom has to have me do something else. this game is a game where you can get allies and team up and take down someone else. it has an amazing multiplayer and i defenitly recommend this game. if i were rating it it would be like 1000/10 it is so good.",53.5
"this game is amazing, it really is, everything about this is, the combat, is fair and very nice to look at, the exploring is always different, you never have a dull experience, the economy is affected by almost everything you do, the other civilizations, incredibly detailed and immersive, theyre mere presence will give you shivers, you play this game, you feel like a ruler, but it is up to you what type of ruler you will be, in this game, you can create a civilization to stand the test of time.",46.5

"extremly time consuming game. really easy to get your moneys worth in game time. i have almost 300 hours in and have only (completed) one match. its a strategy game, but has lots of different aspects. it could be seen as more of a war strategy game, but its more than that. you have to manage your cities, your ecomonmy, diplomatic relations, religion, and technological advances. it takes a few hours to get into the game, but once you do it will be easy to get at least 100 hours out of it. 10/10",422.5

"very good game, even though a bit difficult to understand for people new to the civ games.",103.4

"civilization 5 is a 4x strategy game thats more addicting than crack. its controls are simple and easy to pick up without much of a learning curve and is perfect for begginers to the turn-based strategy game genre. its multiplayer mode is a great way to enjoy the game too if it worked most of the time. often you would find yourself disconnected in the middle of the game if just one person has  internet. with different map types and sizes and dozens of leaders to choose from, different playstyles can be accomadated whether you want to be a viscous warmonger razing cities or a merchant who buys his way to victory. like crack, the first taste is free, next thing you know youve clicked add all dlc to cart.",224.6

"simply incredible. id never played a civilization game before civ 5; its easy to learn and great fun to play. recommend to all strategy fans",220.9
"whats there to say? its civ v. rts juggernaut. its a great game, although there are a few flaws. specifically, the ai is weird. it doesnt act like youd expect. theres no way to game them or be strategic about it at all. you just cant piss anyone off, or you are basically on a losing battle to craft alliances. thats why i always go it solo and do my best to outgun/research everyone else. otherwise, i dont know how to win personally, but im not great at rts games anyway. if you do get this (i do recommend it obviously), just keep the above in mind.",54.0
"ive been playing the civ games since the very first one on my old packard bell pentium 100 dos pc. each title adds new features and gameplay options, but still manages to keep the core gameplay the same. this is one game thatll keep you coming back again and again, more than anything else ive ever played.",116.6

"one of the best games made in the past decade. civ 5 is flawless. hardcore and casual sim fans alike can find something to waste entire weekends with. superb, excellent, masterpiece... these words fall short. if you dont own this, then im afraid i cant speak to you.",145.4
"what was already good just got better! highly recommended!",107.3
"love the replay value and the interesting aspects in the game. the technology tree, geography, and different civilizations keeps it fresh every play through. a standard game takes about 5-8 hours so you get a pretty good bang for your buck, and its not too hard to learn. i would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of turn based strategy games.",62.4
"fun to play by yourself or with friends, one of my favorite strategy games",83.1
"civ v, a semi-complex turn based strategy game where you are a leader of a civilization trying to stand the test of time and become the best civilization and be lost in history. this game is pretty addicting spending about around 2 hours to complete a quick game offline, though i have not tried multiplayer (as i feel as if im not ready) im sure you will find lots of fun in this game. also, steam workshop! 10/10",167.5

"clearly this game is a clever disguise for a time vampire. just one more turn.",343.2
"civilization v continues the tradition of 4x games started with sid meiers civilization. when this game first came out i had reservations and doubts but since playing through a number of times ive grown to enjoy it. im still not sure this game needed to be in 3d since when i play these games i love playing on the huge map and trying to win either the diplomatic, culture or space race victories. unfortunately the further into the game you get the texture maps start taking a while to properly map onto the landscape. i have a gtx 550ti with 1gb of ram on this computer so its not exactly a slouch. other than that the usual quibbles about any civ game applies here. the most annoying is the amount of micro-managing later in the game. all in all its a good game and can be very addictive. id recommend getting it if you enjoy 4x games.",175.7
"a huge improvement imo with one unit per tile. no more stacks of death.",55.0

"civilization is a game you need to set aside a lot of time to enjoy, but if youre okay with the time commitment youll find a very rewarding and addicting strategy game. civilization starts you out with a tiny settlement at the dawn of civilization and by the end of the game youll have a spawling world power in the modern era. with several unique nations to play and different ways to win, theres a ton of ways to play the game and youll always find new things to try. its a very deep strategy game thats very rewarding. its the kind of game where you find yourself awake late at night realizing you havent eaten in hours but you cant stop now because youre at war with the mongolians and youre abount to research gunpoweder which will finally turn the tide of battle...just one more turn.",257.7

"amazingly addictive strategy game. has a huge amount of replay value and is best played with a friend. if youve played the older versions youll like this one. features have changed for both the better and worse, but its a great game overall. my only ask is that pitboss be improved instead of requiring a dedicated machine to host turn by turn matches.",80.5

"ill just play for a little .....next thing you know the day is over, its 4am, and you forgot to feed the dog.",73.3
"you know, this game is amazing, 10/10. but at some points in playing this, it causes you to ponder what the  you are doing in life. when a major holiday just passes you by when you have all intentions in participating in things with your family and friends it kinda hurts. but then you realize that youre about to start a nuclear war and you just kind of think well  it. that just about sums up this game.",418.2

"this is an extremely fun game, however without the dlc and multiplayer it would be dreadedly boring!",107.5
"the thing with this game is you have to span one game across a few days otherwise you are going to get bored with it, like with aoe iii, you can only play one campaign in one sitting or one game so it works out ok. with this you need to get the idae out of your head that i can do one game in 1 sitting its never gonna happen, unless you overdose on caffiene or cocain. i do not promote either tho also its best with friends, not at night tho as everybody goes quite whilst secretly planing how they are going to roll over you quicker than nazi germany on france or amassing great amounts of money to call war on you. its still a solid 8/10 tho just problems with workers not doing work sometimes? bit anyoing and even more time consuming.",84.5
"this is my first time playing a game in this series, and i throughly enjoy it. its great fun to play alone, but it shines when you play with and against your friends in multiplayer! it does take some time to get used to how it works, however there are many strategies at your disposal. i would suggest this to strategy game players, but it can be fun for others as well. a well-made enjoyable game! great game!",94.4

"strategy in its finest. this game is the flagship of the turn-based strategy genera. whether you are into strategy or not, the game offers many simple to complex options to lead your own civilization to endure the test of time. wage war, diplomacy, discoveries and many other tasks await those that want to build the most powerful civilization the world has ever known.",360.0
"this game is great for all kinds of players. for those that like to be a war mongering leader, to those who want to out class their opponents in technology, and even for the peace lover who wants to win by diplomacy or culture. with all the expansions there are so many choices for civilizations and ways to play, the replay value is amazing. i love to personally play team games with my frineds online, but the options for freestyle single player or situation games makes this a game that i cant get enough of.",333.8
"the game franchise speaks for itself. so, there is not much to add. for me, the best thing in civ is that i am never tired of it. i mean. sometimes i want to play something else, but after a few days or weeks i can play it again, as it was yesterday that i bought it. it fun for a long long time and so, buying it was well spent money.",390.4

"although i feel that civ v is slightly out of balance, with several strategies dominating all other strategies (at least against the ai), it is in my opinion the best civilization game to date. a lot of the overwhelming complexiy introduced in previous versionswas removed or reworked, but not in a way that would make the game too simple. its now more accesible to new players, without being less rewarding for veterans.",289.3

"the joy this game has brought me is pretty much unlimited. i can say my grad work and home projects have been neglected mutliple times because i got knee deep in a new campaign. addicting game with lots of awesome game mechanics. i dont play as much anymore mainly because i dont have the time but whenever i get a spare moment, i hop on to play for as long as i possibly can. love this game!",5.6

"the jury is open on how civ v compares to previous games, but personally i havent enjoyed the series this much in a long time. some systems have been simplified, but it only serves to make more room for others to become deeper. empires are now creatures to be fine tuned rather than sprawling beasts, as the rule of diminishing returns will work against land grabs and conquerers. diplomacy is intuitive, and when that fails war is satisfyingly tactical. for decades civilization has held the crown as the pinnacle of open ended strategy gaming, and this iteration only strengthens its grip.",186.2

"when i was younger i remember seeing my grandpas computer one day filled with little characters and hexes (pause/ standby screen); the game was civilization ii. i later learned how great the series was. cilization v is especially good. the updates they have made to the game help a great deal in adding some complexity that was missing when the game was first released. great multiplayer game for friends to just chill and play together.",308.5

"after playing this game for a long, long, long time. i can definitely say it was worth my money and time. i loved next to every aspect of it from watching gandhi start a war with england and k.oing england, to watching barbarians steal a great general and destroying a tank.",91.0

"i love this game first civilization and love it cant wait for beyond earth!",17.8
"this game can make you forget that free time has other uses. it is an incredibly addictive strategy game that takes away large portions of your life. a single game can take over eight hours to finish (on the standard speed, it can be set to go faster or much slower), so this isnt a game for the impatient. since its turn-based you can also easily do other things while playing, making it good for multi-taskers, though playing so casually will extend the already lengthy game times. i highly recommend both the gods & kings and brave new world expansions, as they both add a variety of new and interesting mechanics to keep each game unique. there are some issues, mostly with the multiplayer; mods are not supported in multiplayer - no matter how little they change the game - and the ai becomes much less interactive and therefore much more boring during multiplayer games.",210.3

"amazing single player that draws you in every minute, allowing you to think quickly, and act fast so that you dont lose your precious kingdom. not so amazing multi-player that by about turn 210 leaves you and your friends either arguing, insulting eachother or wondering why the hell youre not doing something else.",135.7
"a really nice stratergy game, and can keep you engaged for hours on end",32.4

"quite possibly the best strategy (in both rts and tbs) game i have ever played, and ive played a lot of those. this one takes the cake from under the noses of strategy game greats like age of empires, age of mythology, starcraft, the total war series, and of course, the previous games from the civ series. if you buy this game, be sure to get the gold edition for the best experience!",566.9
"seriously, one of the only games that just keeps getting better.",91.4

"whew! after a few fun hours its time to turn this off and go to bed. whats that? its time to get up already!? yeah. it happens. with all of its dlc, 50 hours is only scratching the surface. its addicting, its exciting, and its challenging. playing with friends in to the early morning is a common occurence as you to try to out-perform and out-maneuver your opponents. its satisfying when you emerge victourious after an 8 hour game. (lets ignore the disappointment of being defeated after 8 hours). this game is well worth your money as there are many hours of fun to be had. also, the music is pretty darn good.",48.2
"civilization 5 is a great stragergy game for beginners and pros with previous experiences in other civ games not required. this game has a great singleplayer option but playing multiplayer with friends by far takes the cake. grab this game when it is on sale for hours of fun.",15.5

"love playing rts games. its not a surprise when i lose full days in this game.",55.9
"this game is one of my favourites of all time. having racked up plenty of game time, its clear, from my point of view, that the game is addicting and will chew through hours and hours of your free time once you start playing. 10/10, would buy.",459.6
"fun game! i very much recommend this for casual and competative play. just make sure you clear your schedule for the whole night. you can save your game and start again but time flies and aint nobody got time for that.",219.8

"ive been a fan of this table game from the original release in 1991 through the upadtes and even alpha centauri. i must admit that v is my fav version so far. for strategy players its beautiful graphics are skin phenomenon (although welcome), but what i really like is the gameplay balance. many things are more straight-to-the-point compared to the pervious releases, without losing depth. civ v is addictive, immense fun and a great time burner. i can only recommend as well as packing cold food for one week with ya if you are fan of the turn-based strategies and new to this one.",224.3
"if you area fan of any time of stratgey game weather it be real-time or turn by turn, civ 5 and it expansions are a game to certianly pick up. dont fall for the new reskin that they are putting out (beyond earth). civ 5 will be around for a long time",148.4

"with bnw, civ has recovered from its unengaging start and demonstrates the spirit of the franchise: just one more turn...",535.8
"great game to start into the franchise even if youve never played previous installments. i would also recommend getting the expension as it fixes a lot of minor inconvenience from the main game. pros - interesting unique ability from each civ - smart different type of ai (conqueror passifism etc) - each game is different from the last playthrought - more to come con - once you become too aggressive, there is no redeeming yourself - no defense against certain things (ie : atomic weapon) - ai is smart, but single minded, they should change with time",619.8
"totally awesome game. great waste of time if you have it",25.8
"amazing game. great way to blow some steam and eat up hours upon hours. this game will suck you in and you wont be able to stop thinking about your game when you go away from your computer. perfect for any turn-based stragety game lover.",74.1
"great game, a little hard to get going but when you have friends to play it with it is definitely fun",94.7
"i definitely recommend this game. it is quite time consuming, but this isnt a problem, because with each turn the game gets more in depth, making the player want to continue playing. plus, who doesnt want to take over the world and become the ultimate world leader. it is even better when you invite your friends to play.",282.4
"fun game to play if you have friends that are into strategy games, or just simple singleplayer with the dumb ai. the game mechanics are better than any other, and 0 bugs encountered so far. i rate this game: 3 meatballs out of 5 potatoes",21.6
"very good strategy game. due to its versatility there is a very high risk of addiction!",266.1
"civ 5 is a strong rendition to the amazing franchise. along with the brave new world and gods and kings expansion the expirence has unmatchable depth except form is its predecessors. the only thing thing the game lacks is the diplomatic options from civ 4. (this is easily fixed with mods found in the steam workshop) all in all the game is worth every penny .",456.1

"it might be confusing at the start but it gets really cool and it has hours and hours of gameplay.",11.0
"i normally dont ever play games like this. in fact this is the first 4x strategy game ive ever played. i am really enjoying it, this game is such a blast to play. this is definitely not a game for everyone but do give it a try. download the demo, if you like i say pick it up. i bought it on the summer sale and am loving it to death.",8.9

"this game has stolen my life from me! 5/5 would buy again",363.8
"from the first time my friend mentioned this game to me i thought it would be crap, so me and my friend did the steam sharing thingy and i tried it out and after half an our of gameplay i realized how fun the game was. some people might disaggre and think it is crap and i can accept that but for people who like strategy games (like me) i would highly recommend this game as it taked time to work out (as you see i have 26 hours of gametime). overall i have to reccomend this game because i think that it is definitely not a waste of 22.00.",31.8
"this is one of the greatest games i have played in a few years. vanilla civ v is wonderful, and the dlc brings variety to the basic game, but steam workshop will allow you to play epic matchs without any risk of repeat fatigue. as of now, my play time is over 200 hours; you dont spend over a week on a bad game.",206.7
"i find myself sinking hours into civ 5 without realizing, arguably the greatest in its genre and my favorite strategy game. it has fun, intuitive game-play and (despite a lack luster combat system) a large sense of tension placed on your every move to achieve the final victory!",184.8
"sweet baby jesus do i love this game. if you into sinkin a couple of hours into plotting the downfall of other countries, this is the game for you!",756.8
"a great game that you can spend hours just playing through one match and end up getting rocked by another civilization. watch out for ghandi especially because he is a sneaky one. i would suggest at some point in time in trying out the game difficulty diety because it is quite the challenge. i never played a civ game until recently and have enjoyed everything about the game and expansions of the game. a casual strategy game that can get intense at any moment.",1038.9
"for the first time i can relate to why contrys still are mad at eachother after dacades, very good game. both singel and multiplayer. very addictive ones you start its prety possible you will be in for a 8h gaming sesion",109.4
"if you like previous entires in the series, youll likely enjoy this one as well. the fourth game still stands tall as my favorite, however civ v is a pretty fun entry. sometimes it feels like it could use a little more depth, and id like some advancement beyond the information age, but overall im quite happy with the game.",30.7
"well... over 18 hours into the game, and i barely have finished the tutorial and 1 game. need i say more ? alright. apart from its extensive playtime, the gameplay mechanics are excellent, the game is very easily modable (thanks to steam workshop, you can play campains on wwii, lord of the rings, game of thrones and so on), easy to set up as you want, a game can last (from what ive seen) between 10mn and 9+ hours, im sure this is even not a lot compared to what you can do. the mechanics are really easy to learn, but seem to be hard to master. and once you grow tired of being pwned by the computer, you can also get pwned by other players online ! thats wonderful. this game is truly a masterpiece, and should be in every strategy fan library !",40.5
"one of the best rts games i ever played. at first i was like meh , nothing special and started to play. after palying for a while i looked at my watch. 2 hours passed. so yep , really addicting. but always remeber one thing : never  up with gandhi. never. final mark : 9 / 10 - fun and addicting.",10.8
"well you all know my satnce on this glorious game 11/10",202.7

"one of the single most addictive games i think ive ever played. each single campaign takes hours to get through, even on the fast setting! tense multiplayer,countless approaches to winning and this only gets better with each dlc added to the game. cannot wait for the new civ announced at e3! short summary: epic.",77.1

"game is not for the impatient. if you like statergy it is the game for you.",82.1
"totally worth it. when its 6am and youve yet to sleep its because of this game.",75.6
"i know a lot of people compared civ v unfavorably to civ iv when civ v first came out. as a long (and i do mean long) time player of sid meier civilization games, i never understood that as i had a completely different impression. to me this is one of the best civ games since civ ii and alpha centauri. it was a return to some of the basics that made the game great with a number of tweaks (hexogonal grid, no unit stacking) that i feel improve it. add in the additional options in the wonderful expansions and you have, in my opinion, an all-time classic. i recommend this for everyone.",391.9

"firstly, i absolutely love this game. i also know many others do to, as this is one of the most played games on steam. one might be surprised at how fun and hilarious it is to rewrite history in a plethora of different ways. ive had tons of fun in single player, but adding another person or people into the mix multiplies the fun. i ever so highly recommend this game, especially since the complete edition ends up saving you $100!",258.2

"the popularity and longetivity of the civilization series kinda speaks for itself, but civ v once again raises the bar for the 4x strategy games genre. the level of customization, of choices given for different kind of experiences makes it the one game i replayed the most. there are many difficulty levels which, at higher levels, give you very challenging game where you need to be a master at geopolitical control and making the best out of all little advantages you got while compensating for your disadvantages. there are many concepts, old and new, that can help you build your civilizations. religion, cultural policies, tourism, happiness, diplomatic relations, trade, sciences, ideologies ... the combinations are almost endless. once again, a civ game i have played (too?) much of !",380.9
"very good game, really recomend. i love how you can see units fighting.",417.0
"in all honesty, this game can best be described as one. more. turn. ive literally fired up civ v at 2 am because i couldnt sleep and accidentally played until 6 am before. thats how addicting it is. try it once, get addicted forever.",157.2

"this is probably a drop in the bucket as far as review for civilization v go, but all the good reviews dont lie. this is really a just one more turn game.",704.2
"this is the single most infuriating game i think ive ever played. it takes forever to accomplish anything, and trying to win in nearly impossible. that being said, the game is entirely too addicting, and once i start playing i cant bring myself to stop. i greatly reccomend this game, and think it could be enjoyable for anyone, despite their usual game genre.",45.5

"an amazing game if you are into strategy. my love for this game is mainly because you get to build a civilization from the times of cave men to the times that have yet to be seen. during this time you do not only build your empire but you see the technology that society has discovered and the world views that the world has lived by. 10/10 - ign",339.2
"i bought this game just because i liked the thought of politically molesting my friends who were playing it online at the time. i have now logged coming up to 600 hours in game. the variety of tactics using different civilizations in their most effective ways is a surefire way to keep the game fresh, especially when installing the mods from the workshop. whether its a complete reskin or a civ that holds meaning to you you always find time just leaves.",564.1

"i have been a civ fanatic since the dawn of civilization (pun intended). i held off on getting civ v due to all the negative reviews and comments about it. im really sorry that i did. civ v has to be the greatest of all civ games to date! games go much faster than in previous versions, are more challenging, and present so many more variables to allow for greater replay value. if you havent gotten civ v yet do yourself a favor and do so (goty is the best bang for your buck!)...and be sure to pick up the newest expansion too!",128.8

"the best civilization game of all, once it got gods and kings and brave new world. score 95/100. i have played it extensively and will play it again. it is a fabulous and deep game with so many gameplay styles that are viable. i love minor things like no more need transport ships and one unit per tile. the hex tiles are great as well and added a much-needed upgrade in the tactics. one of my 10 favorite game series ever, and the best one of the bunch. i cannot recommend it more.",206.7
"what can you say that hasnt been said? im not funny enough for a one liner review...every iteration of civ is better. love the new non stackable units. much more strategic and puts emphasis on each individual unit. smooth graphics, fun mods, better luxury management. aaa title for a reason.",28.3

"a decent turn based strategy in the civ series. unfortunately not as good as alpha centauri or civlization 4, but the combat system was pretty enjoyable. i did not like the loss of a lot of detail in many of the other systems in the game. also the lack of ability to stack workers can be a huge pita.",118.8

"civ v, as it is called, is definitely one of the best strategy games out there. it is perfect for both newcomers to the genres of strategy and turned-based games, and experienced players as well. there is not an intimidating learning curve, and there are plenty of mods and dlc adding new nations, and other little goodies. the dlcs also bring a unique bit with the addition of tourism and religion. the game can be a bit of a challenge, especially on higher difficulties or on certain missions, or scenarios as the game refers to them as. the game is also barely taxing on a computer system and runs fine with nice graphics and a friendly interface, with very minimal bugs and mistakes. from tribals hiding in a tiny village, to building a mega empire spanning the world, this game is sure to be fun for anyone who is a fan of, or looking to get in to, strategy games. 10/10",278.2

"as always, civilization is fantastic. i personally enjoy civ v over iv. the hex system and military unit changes were a fantastic edition. movement and combat requires a little more thought now than the blob of death from iv. the game is beautiful, runs well, has wonderful music, and with the workshop, adding mods is even easier now.",121.0

"absolutely amazing game. love it. you do need to buy at least gods and kings + brave new world to make the game better than civ iv, and the combat is a bit, well clunky, but aside from that it is one of the best strategy games on pc right now. 10/10.",341.2
"one of the best strategy games i have ever played; there are some parts of the vanilla game i find lacking, especially the late game. this problem is in my opinion mitigated, if not removed altogether, by the addition of the games two main dlcs; brave new world and gods and kings. whether you are new to the turn based strategy genre or not, id recommend you buy this game, just be careful when playing against ghandi, or you will have a nuclear winter to worry about.",282.1

"this is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. at this point i have clocked around 700 hours of gameplay and i still only really feel like im scratching the surface of all it has to offer. the single player is great, the multiplayer is great. it does take a considerable amount of time/patience/dedication to actually finish a game - quite often they can literally go on for days. if youre looking for a strategy game with mountains of content, challenging scenarios, and endless hours of entertainment then civ v is for you! youll never be able to stop . . . just one more turn . . . .",840.3
"if you like turn based strategy games then you will most likely enjoy this. although if you enjoy turn based strategy games you will already have it. so hope youre enjoying playing it.",199.5

"amazing never has there been a bad civ and they always get better rarely do titles get better for the community because past games seem to be better take for example cll of duty ghost was hated soo much as it was compared to black ops which was amazing but civ looking back i thnk this is the best one yet the machanics are way more smother there are better graphics i love it good work sid miers anyone who loves this game should try beyond earth seriously it is amazing.",59.1

"its definately worth it, i love it. its for the type of people who love strategy and long-term games.",78.2
"addicting!!! watch the clock when you are playing this game because time will get away very easy! the games very good though there are some little things like getting a boat traped when another player buys slots around it and if you move it war breaks out.....but other than that its a very good game if you like board games like settlers of katan this is the game for you! (dont know if katan is the name but it sounds right)",16.4
"ghandi was being a smartass and then the game froze. i re-loaded it and ghandi was still a smartass.",18.3
"first off: this game is damn awesome. ive been a fan of civ for a few years now, so i might be a bit biased, but civ v really is awesome. it combines the old style of civ iv with a new hexa-grid for even more awesomeness. if you liked civ iv, you will like civ v. simple as that.",280.4
"an enjoyable game that gave me many late nights. its a game that you can always comeback and play again and again, esp with the modding community. 10/10, do yourself a favor and buy it.",125.3

"so great. one of those time suck games - youll sit down to play for an hour and look up and the sun has just cleared the horizon!",652.0
"great game, its always fun to see your civilization evolve from sticks and stones up to the nukes! this game can be fun in solo but also with friends which makes it even better because you can trade tactics together and do research agreements to speed up your domination!",178.6
"this game is awesome. for me it defines what turn based stragedy games are. just make sure you have adequate time on your hands... a single game takes a long time to finish. but its definitely worth it!",88.0
"some day i may stop obsessively playing this...but i dont want that day to come.",678.3
"if you enjoy playing long singleplayer games alone go ahead and buy the game. if youre buying this game expecting to play some multiplayer, do yourself a favor and buy something else.",12.1

"this game has taken over my life, 3 days and 22 hours played, would recommend complete package though.",88.7
"with the brave new world add on civ5 is highly recommended. depending on the difficulty and other settings you are busy days per session. for me personally a great game. one reason for me to play a game on the pc again. warning! extremely addictive!",179.9
"a fantastic version of civilisation with everything that you could want. not played for many years, so the introductions of policies was a real treat and really helped make a difference to how you progressed your nation. not sure i am a big fan of the religion option, dont seem to have a way to control its influence without starting a war - although that might be the designers being realistic! not sure of the point of city-states either, but as you can pretty much custom the gameplay, not a biggie. all in all, great fun.",38.0
"civ is great as it isnt something you can beat in the first few games, you have to play over and over with friends and by yourself to learn all the different strategies as what works for rome might not work for england. however you do have to change the setting to your preference as you may not like your screen juming around from troop to troop with out you telling it to do so.",165.3
"simply put, this is one of the best games ive ever played. even with the vanilla civ v, i spent countless hours playing just one more turn. with gods and kings and the brave new world expansions, the game only got better. i paid full price for almost all the civ v dlcs and expansions, but it was worth it --- and i have more than 600 hours of playing time to prove it. ive had the sun rise on me many, many times, whether playing civ v alone or with friends. the depth and complexity of this game ensures that every playthrough will be different, every decision interesting. and as if the game isnt nearly perfect already, it still gets improvements 4 years after its initial launch! this game is a true classic, a standard by which other games of its kind will always be measured and is a must-have for any strategy game lover.",601.0
"honestly one of the best games i have ever played. the replayability is unreal. i own the complete version and the dlc just adds so much depth to the game. the only problem i have is how hard mods are to install. pros gameplay ui replayability depth graphics mods (though limited they are there) cons sometimes wish there were more diplomacy options wish i had more control over my citizens sometimes",44.7
"extreamly fun game to play! would defintly recommend!",85.1

"hello! i have done a few stupid reviews however i am going to do a real review so lets begin. so civilization v has many dlc packs however people will rush straight into brave new world but dont its a great dlc pack however you will miss alot that civilization v offers to begin with, i see many people only getting this to download modded players like winston curchill: with the united kingdom of great britian and northern irelan, or lenin with whatever the ussr stands for (sorry my patriotism is showing xd). but lets be honest you are missing out on alot of content which in evry enjoyable! so civilization v by itself is 8/10 but with brave new world is 10/10 for me!",74.6
"freaking awesome game, tons of ways to win and many avenues of approaches!",47.1
"a classic, cant go wrong with this. i just wish more people played it. sure, the graphics arent the greatest. it is however fun. very versatile in game play and style. build up armies, make treaties, beat people down, build em up, piss em off and then be at war with the world. its great, fun, learn cultures, and history all at the same time while having fun. what more could ya ask for ?",239.1
"took one look at the artwork/graphics and said nah. and that was that for a long time. i eventually gave in to all the hype when it was on sale and omfg, its only like the best grand strategy ive ever played! entire days have been happily lost since.",91.1
"civ was one of the first games i ever played and to this day each new addition has been a staple in my life ^_^",33.2
"while this game has been given high scores from professional game reviewers it has also been given bad marks by some longtime civilization players. i dont think these naysayers are necessarily in the majority though. personally the game is pretty good. it is not as good as civilization ivs beyond the sword expansion but i do like it a lot. 1upt (one unit per tile) is a refreshing change that will only get better with further expansions. build choices matter more than ever now because you have to balance happiness, culture, expansion, defense, & conquest all through gold or buildings. it is no longer as simple as adjusting a slider.",883.2
"if you have any respect for your free time, do not buy this. it has a small tendency to suck you in (in a good way). you play for hours in what seemed like minutes. also, got denouced for being a warmonger by atilla the hun. 10/10",62.9
"great to play with friends and it can fly. much better than civ iii, so happy birthday!",109.2

"very addictive game! the (expensive) gods & kings dlc is a must buy though.",387.7
"addictive, beautifully desingned, polished gui. expect to lose several hours of your life playing it, its worthy of that.",323.9
"i recommend this game alot. if you play it multiplayer it might be a bit laggy, but it still works. its a really good game where you can challenge the ai in a stragetic game with no possible way of nothing how theyll react.",118.9
"beautiful and intrigiung game. highly recomend for all audiences.",40.4
"this game is one of the best games in my steam library, if i start a game ill probably play for about 9 hours with no breaks (besides the lue) and my friends and i love the  outta this game xd i would definately buy it again if anything happened to it 1010 my favorite game ;)",101.6
"its civ... what more can be said. by far the best of the series. have enjoyed many an hour playing it and without any bug, crashes, or other anomolies that would detract from enjoyment. i look forward to civilization vi when ever that gets developed and released. highly recommend.",846.6

"excellent game! i cannot stress how amazing this game is for anyone that loves strategy games.",47.2
"no turn-base strategy games are better made made than the sid meiers civilization 5. i love that game.",324.5
"i reallly enjoy this game because its complicated many ways to win, and you always have fun even when your new so i think you should play it",74.3
"i loved it however this is simply my kind of game. the game practically plays itself considering its turn based you only have a few decisions to make then its up to the computer. so it probably will be boring at times.",454.4
"great game, very addictive. the game was good but the dlcs make it worth while with both gods and kings and brave new world. so much to do and so many ways to win!",166.3
"i have spend 200+ hours playing sid meiers civilization 5. it has got to be one of my most favorite games i have ever played. it has wonderful ways to play how you want to play and still have a fun time doing it.",307.5
"very fun and worth the money if you can get it on sale. the combat is much more enjoyable than civ 4 (no more making huge stacks of units on one tile and rolling around the map... no more 500 year sieges on cities with 30 units stacked in them). i like how the terrain matters much more for both combat and empire infastructure planning (no more having a road to every tile unless you want to be bankrupt). embarking is a nice feature which means you dont have to wait for transport boats to go to sea... other than that its basically just another civ game. entertaining but not head of the pack by any means.",183.6
"proposal to congress to repeal the embargo against the ottoman empire. request from the ottoman empire for silver in exchage for 4 votes for the proposal at the congress.",159.2
"amazing game love it just wish i had more people to play it with.",289.3
"this is an amazing strategy game for both hardcore and not so hardcore players. it can relly take you hours if you are building you dream-emprie so i warn you. for civilization fans=buy for turn-based fans=buy for people thinking about buying=buy for people who can only play 20 min a day=sadly dont buy it can be played in shoter burst but i still prefer playing for atleast the 40-45 min. at a time.",101.5
"excellent game if you are into macro style strategy games. the graphics are pretty good and run well on lower end computers. its unfortunate at higehr difficulties the a.i. gets unfair advantages to compensate for poor coding.",88.1
"a really good game, especially for a returning civ fan. the more people you have with you, the better!",31.9
"probably one of the best games that i have ever played. in short, if you have a new friend, introduce this to them and tell them you are playing the short game. they will look up in eight hours with the words, i thought this was the short game you will only smile and laugh knowing you have destroyed another mans eight hours with your hobby.",406.3
"where civilization iv was clunky, this game has trimmed away all the fat and baggage that was accumulated over the last few games to create a fresh, streamlined version of civilization for the next generation of gamers. even though im terrible at strategy games, this game has me clocking in many, many hours.",38.3
"started saturday morning now its monday and im not sure ive slept... eh i can afford one more turn.",63.6
"great game to play with friends whether youre in a friendly helpint mood or want a mock war. also a great way to learn a few facts about world civilization. great game for those who love stategies.",249.5
"good game if you like to just kill time. really entertaining and challenging if you increase the difficulty but otherwise fairly easy.",514.1
"with 207 hours and counting, its safe to say i enjoy this game. and i do. while i was somewhat sceptical about the base game, just as with civ iv before it, civilization v has blossomed with its second expansion. with the ruturn of religion in the first expansion and trading in the second has made this a true heir to the civilization legacy. if you like this kind of game, you should grab a copy of civ v.",226.4
"most addicting game ive ever played! i start a game and 8 hours will go by in what seems like a minute. you can play the game for hundreds of hours and never get sick of it. definitely worth the money!",231.9
"though dramatically different from civ 4 and its incredible amount of micromanaging, this iteration is another exceptional entry into my favorite series. would highly recommend to anyone!",928.5
"i have loved and played civ for many years now. this one, they changed it so much!!! its difficult to get into it at first, particularly when used to the other game play. still an amazing game though!",42.9
"amasing strategie game really good deal especially on sale",156.2
"great game, its something you can play over and over.",37.0
"from the hex tiles to mobile artillery this game hes kept us all saying one. more. turn. the original game is fun, and just when that starts to get slow, gods and kings appears. boom, everything you were missing appears. another thousand hours go by and whats this?!? brave new world appears and you dont even know what to do with yourself. just watch out for those world congress elections. forget about the forbidden palace and you just may find yourself losing early.",334.9
"the reasons to play any other game besides this one are very few indeed.",266.8
"simply put - the global leader in turn based strategy drastically improves on its previous efforts in the series. disappointed that religion doesnt come in the base game but comes in an extra dlc which i havent personally got yet. fantastic visuals and art, interesting snapshots of language and innovations to the series like 1 unit per tile really improve tactical gameplay.",35.7
"8/10 better than 4 in combat and tiles, worse in everything else. expansions fix it though to be 10/10.",7.6
"-this game is great. you will go from the ancient ages and advance through technologies into modern day civilization.",341.1

"its like a giant game of super chess where you play as a historical leader. you must trade control social policies and fend off the advances of the evil warmongering nuclear fueled ghandi,the epitome of terror. 10/10",69.6
"what can i say? this game is perfect example of strategies! begining with civ ii i walked this way along with civ, and i completely glad with this game! civ 5 has began a new age of strategies! and i recommend it to everyone!",19.4
"probably the best yet in the series. my only complaint is that you need the expansions to get some of, what seem like, basic features. 8/10",19.8
"so much fun to play constantly has you thinking of what you should do next. 1 hour quickly turns to 3 or 4 whenever i play this.",25.1
"an extremely addictive game, will have you playing for hours!",252.0
"complete edition: almost a masterpiece! the only problem i have is boring, strategic ai, that makes me completely feel like im playing by myself. thankfully, the rest of the game is so wonderful that its easily worth the purchase! and surprisingly the new mechanics are so easy to learn, which i was intimidated about before playing. yes there is multiplayer, and yes during the regular waking hours there are people willing to play (if you set your steams region to a big city in the real world), but multiplayer on med-large maps is unplayable as people bail out off the game 90% of the time. what would have kept people to play was an official world-wide tourney ladder & visible scoreboard. a true 8/10 buy with confidence on sale.",96.9
"its very addicting, and very easy to pass hours without realizing youve done so. ...just one more turn...just one more turn...",16.7
"its civ 5. you already know its awesome if youre even considering buying it.",84.6
"this game is a fantastic strategy game, i enjoyed playing this with my friends. the only drawback to the game if you can call it one, is that this game gets you carried away as in when you sit down to play you dont realize that six hours have passed. of course that could be labeled as a success, regardless i enjoy this game no matter how much sleep i have lost playing it.",72.6
"i had forgotten how addictive this game was, but now with expansions, it will swallow your life.",264.7
"just one more turn, and ill declare war. just one more turn... ...one more... ...... its 2am.",304.3

"you cant get any better! i find that every time i play its a new experience, new tactics, new civs to hate on. if a game never gets old it should get an 11/10",283.8

"such a great game to play, and be warned, bananas start wars!",94.5
"civilization v is one of the best pc games i can suggest to anyone who asks! its a massive time consumer but its deffinetly worth it! i personly own all the dlcs which t received after purchasing the complete edition, and it just creates a whole new gaming experience! so buy this game,i urge you! you will not regret it! 5*s 10/10",120.4
"how can i not recommend this with almost 200 hours logged? especially with the gods and kings expansion...you will see your life wither away as you play for just...one...more...turn!",241.7

"civ v is an absolutley incredible, immersive, and addicting game. my praise for this game truly cannot be expressed in words. if youre on the fence about buying this at normal price, just buy it when its cheap during the summer sale, you wont regret it!",125.9

"this game is worth the buy, i have never played such a game like it. it is just amazing",89.2
"turn based strategy and loads of fun :) do not expect to be playing for an hour or two.... this game will eat away days and nights for that matter. it is by far one of the best turn based strategy games out there. so many things to do, so many people to conquer!",277.3
"this game shows thing that happen in the past, the present and the future which you can combind many stragtegy to win over your enemies.that include be common enemy to someone or make the alliance to overthrow the most powerful player from his seat of this game which can be done throught many ways either direct or from the way that they would never notice what coming for them.",82.9

"civ5 to me has a really high replay value. every match is unique and depending on how you set up the game can pose some challenge. when all is said and done, i have to give this a 9.1/10.",337.2
"ive never really hated someone who wanted peace so much. its a shame gandhi is a pr!ck.",50.9
"this is coming from a person who does not like turn based games. i bought the super package and enjoy the game. i played this game vanilla, and did not enjoy this game. if you play this with turns i highly recommend a 3 minute timer. some people lose track of time and become rude by making people wait. that said this can be a very fun game. do not look for action, but a quiet evening with this game. try and have a book handy, or the tv on a show thats pretty good. end verdict this is great clean fun. 8.5/10",70.7
"masterfully crafted. turn-based strategy dont get any better than this. its much less complex compared to its predecessor civilization iv, hence much more accessible to most of us. endless replayability with its awesome choice of leaders and campaign options. and theres that just... one... more... turn! dammit!",166.6
"civ is civ. the only thing i didnt care for is that units arent really what they appear, stats are the only thing that is taken into consideration. so if enough spearman gang up on your tanks, your tanks will lose.",27.1
"what an amazing game! one of my favorite games of all time. people think its really hard to get used to it and say its really complex, but if you give it a shot youll see its a ton of fun and very addictive. the expansion packs add a lot of content and are also worth buying. dont hesitate, just buy this game!",231.7
"20/10 on a sunday, my friends and i decided to play a quick game as soon as we all downloaded it. we then learned there is no such thing as a quick game. we started at 9am and our quick game ended at 11pm. luckily it was summer break so no homework was missed.",154.7

"after many hours of play i can say this game ruined my life.",130.5
"if you have even looked at this game and considered hm, looks kind of neat. then you should buy the complete edition right now. gods and kings expansion is optional brave new world is extremely good and pretty much required to make this game a 10/10 the complete edition is highly suggested. theres far too much about this game for me to ramble on about. if you need more information go look up multiple reviews that arent from steam or one source. however, you can trust me when i say, unless you absolutely hate the grand strategy genre civ5 complete edition is a must buy, especially when its on sale.",161.5

"slow, strategic, gameplay about building a new civilization (not customizable) in a world. history is remade each time you start a new game. unfortunately, ai is bad, and a feature i found on civilization iv which i expected to have in this game is not here. wish when a player disconnects, we could vote again to either wait for the play, save and continue, or save and quit.",354.9

"this game is the best game ever made. 8/8 m8 that is my r8",16.5
"a classic that keeps getting better with each iteration. the change of interface and tile-set are welcome features and adding the expansions on top of that gives it an even greater depth that leaves players with a near infinite amount of game time before ever getting bored.",39.3
"if you have any desire to play this, do it! this is one of the best turn based stratagy games i have ever played. great difficulty but has enough hints and help that it doesnt become overwellming. great game to play with friends if you just have a whole day to waste.",26.9
"i must say its a must have! lots of hours in this game and its cool! buy it!",225.9
"if you buy it, get at least one of the expansion packs. vinalla game is kinda meh.",253.0

"epic good game, mp is kinda nightmare tho specially with random guys who keep quiting",556.0
"one of those games that, once you start, you cant stop playing. civ v is a great starting point for newcomers, you dont need to have played any of the previous games or even games in the same genre - youll understand what to do very quickly. the base game lacks depth, meaning that veterans of the genre may get bored after a few matches but, luckily, the expansions add a lot of much needed content and depth which is bound to please jest about anyone. highly reccomended, but only if you pick up the expansions with it.",113.6

"you can say alot about civilization... how it kills your social life, sucks away weeks and months like a black hole... but non of that changes the fact that civilization v with its expansions is one of the best tbs games abount, if you enjoy detailed, engaging tbs - that will give you an unforgiving challenge if you ask for it, or just a casual relaxed game you cannot fail with civ5. to my wifes despair - take a look at my hours in this game.. :)",199.2
"a game that when you say, more of the same. is the highest reccomendation you can give it.",216.6
"everybody asks, where have all the hours gone? when recommending this game... to global domination my friends. now, if that doesnt interest the rest of you, go back to your soulless existence and leave me to bask in the glory that is civ 5.",339.9
"it can be a very fun game despite the casual graphic and run time error. i would consider it ... 7/10",185.1
"sounds like keith david did a voiceover for the trailer. 10/10",43.7
"freaking awesome!!! sid has done it again. he has a legacy me thinks.",4.1
"very fun, very addictive, though ive only played the game with the brave new world expansion pack added, which apparently makes it a whole lot better than vanilla, according to some friends. grabbing both together can set you back a pretty penny so if youre interested, id recommend picking this one up when its on sale. its a great blend of peaceful and tense that really keeps you in the game, be it leaning back in your chair or on the edge of it.",418.6
"i have bought every civilization game ever made, i love this game and i still do, but i dont appreciate loosing my option to play the game without being connected & being forced to do so while paying full price. this is in my opinion a betrayal by the franchise i have grow to love over the years. i will not purchase another game. though i think this is a fantastic platform it is not how i personally like to handle my business. i dont want anyone to know what im doing at any given moment if i choose not to tell them. this is my right to have privacy any i feel kinda violated.",102.3
"i never really like turn based but after this i was like wow!!. its a great game and i highly recommend this to player who like turn based and also strategy, p.s sorry about spelling:(",9.9
"civilization v is the best game i have played in a long time. it has great graphics and it is fun to attack people.",50.7
"this game has sucked sooooo many hours out of my life. life well spent!!!!!!!",400.8
"its a awsome game with in depth strategy tactics a must have",171.8
"i love this game, but honestly i had no idea how i got to play it or that it was even in steam for purchase, i purchased another steam game and this was all ready for me to install. had i known i mite have bothered with the multiplayer setting i loved this game since i a kid id still loved it and cant wait till the development team decide its time to upgrade it even more so and give it a awesome out of this world make 3d first person view make over.",8.8
"amazing game but needs to have a new one jesus its been 4 years",8.6
"got to play the game during steams free period. i was a long time player of civ iii. getting the chance to play civ v even without the dlc was a good thing. i spent 24 hours in a single game over the course of two days. always had to get that next turn in. the only negative i can think of is in the interaction with other countries. not really a negative but it is a different experience than civ iii and tooks some time to get use to. never did find a means to perform any spy tactics. overall i enjoyed it. i was set to win by score, culture or space. the space ship managed to be built first.",371.8
"wish they wouldve dropped the price for civ v in honor of the release of beyond earth instead of puting it as free to play for three days. otherwise, great game! would purchase if it was cheaper.",23.9
"great entry in the civ series if you dont mind the glacial pace the game runs at. even on my quad core i find that the turns take a while to process long before you get that far into the game, slowing things down to a crawl. still, the graphics are nice and are quite an improvement over iv. recommended for fans of the series.",63.5
"so many hours put on this game, its fairly adictive and entretaining. just remember.. dont trust napoleon ;)",104.0
"this game is damn-near perfect, especially with the brave new world expansion. the only thing holding back perfection is that hitler is not the german leader. its perfectly fine to have ghengis khan, who  and murdered his way across europe, but hitler is totally not cool cause he might offend some sensitive-sally. makes perfect sense.",254.4
"fantastic game, you will lose hours of your life into it.",72.4
"i seriously cant get enough of this game. its absolutely wonderful and this sale is killer.",37.7
"this game is great if you have an hour or 12 to burn.",966.5
"awesome game, so glad it was finally ported to linux. can get very intricate.",29.9
"just.... one... more... turn.... *looks out the window to see its light outside*.... why are you so addicting, civ5?",692.0
"im torn, but i am going to go with no, it seems to me they broke apart 1 product into 4 small packages that you need to buy individually in order to have the ful experience, it really seems they did not finish the base civ 5 so dlcs were bought. not worth the individual price of the game and the dlcs, if you find a bundle during the steam sale however, go for it.",167.6
"fun when played with people that arent warmongering s.",21.2
"board game for peple who are too hardcore for board games.",270.4

"way too enthralling. i could spend days in this game.",91.9
"civilization v is a great game that really lets you play however you want. its also great if you want to rip apart any friendships that you have. in all seriousness though, get it, if you have the cash.",72.3
"best civilization game by far. good chill and wind down game.",243.6
"civ v is an amazing game. although the vanilla game gets dull rather quickly the expansions and mods are what keeps it interesting.",197.5
"this is a great game. i cannot say enough good things about it. best 4x ever.",566.7
"incredibly addicting turn-based strategy game. you will easily spend *many, many, many, many* hours on this game! and no matter how many games you finish, youll always return for more!",15.1
"fun in single player, fun with friends. i enjoy the extra game play from the dlcs, was impressed with the culture revamp with brave new world worth getting the complete pack. only problem ive seen with the game is slow loading sometimes in multiplayer matches with several human players, mostly due to the game trying to process every players actions at the same time with shared turns instead of consecutive... i would recommend to any strategy/world domination game fans.",233.7
"wish it was 3 hours in the future and dont want to deal with life? here is your answer.",124.8
"having watched the evolution of this series, ive been able to see the improvements that have been made with each iteration. the turn based strategy format is a classic, and provides for some deep stategic thinking. the game is very in-depth for the progression of the civilizations involved, and with so many variables, civilization gives endless replayability. three thumbs up!",364.2
"this is the best turn-based strategy game i have ever played. pros: beautifully crafted game with lots of depth to it. cons: complex and hard to learn.",170.1
"an amazing game. only get it if you have a decent monitor size however, its no fun trying to play on a laptop. so many good mods as well.",443.8
"a great intro to strategy gaming; has some depth but not to overly complex.",27.9
"i really enjoyed this game. cant wait for beyond earth.",101.2
"over 300 hours playing this game and i still have only seen a portion of the content available. the best turn based, 4x strategy game i have ever played. the expansions are a must as they are literally game changers.",378.4
"forward facing time machine. get in, next thing you know. its tuesday!",103.5
"one of the best strategy games on the market. you will definitely lose hours of your life and you wont even be mad.",156.2
"great game! if you are fans of strategy games, youre in for a treat! very in depth gameplay but also very easy to pick up. since it is on sale for the steam sale i say it is a must buy!!!",5.1
"if you are very complex then this game is for you!! its very fu**ing good!!!!!!",275.5
"if you enjoy games that get you sucked in and then you realize youve been awake for 48 hours straight playing it.... this is the game for you",181.5
"great game! it is kind of a slow game for multiplayer but the single player gameplay is great. i would reccomend this to anyone.",397.2
"this game is for anyone who whanted to change history in there owned way",27.0
"a massive time killer, well worth every hour given over. civ 5 is a solid advancement to the series. the expansions are fantastic, though it can take awhile to adjust to new features. overall a solid investment.",287.4
"all time classic and favorite. it gets better with every new version and now multiplayer works better than ever. highly recommend.",86.7
"civ is a really in depth awesome game that is so addictive that i can play it for hours and not realize it.",102.9
"simply one of the greatest games that was ever made. i am never able to stop playing it.",167.5
"the pinnacle of civilization games. it is so good.",751.8
"what can i say about this game that hasnt already been said. stay away. it will consume your very being. your soul. once, i sat down to play civ at 9am in the morning, and when i looked up after a while i noticed that the clock read 10. wow, that was a lot of game for a hour! too bad it was 10pm. 10/10 would play again",49.2
"best strategy game there is. has an amazing replay ability.",543.1
"this game is great if you need something to pass the time. i have spent hours splitting time playing the game and doing something else at the same time. at least on the easier levels, once you ramp of the difficulty you really have to think about what each action you do and its effects 20 turns in the future. i only wish that the game would work on directx 11 for me.",227.4
"an awesome turned based strategy game starring some of the world historys great and late leaders*. fight foreign nations for control of resources and lead your nation to victory via military, cultural, scientific or diplomatic dominance. *leaders may not be portrayed with any historical accuracy.",461.7
"when i started playing this game, i was a lowly, inexperienced lord to the japanese empire. now, i rule all the land with my good friend, constantinfinity. we might have clashing playstyles, but it all works out because im always right... and not a communist. all in all, excellent game.",128.4
"just. one. more. turn. seriously. as a person pretty inexperienced with civilization, i had a lot of fun learning the game. i love how the game play and objectives can change depending on which civilization you decide to pick! there is plently of replayability, and i think both people new and old to the series will find a lot of enjoyment. picking up the bundle is highly reccomended so you can at least get gods & kings along with some dlc.",99.8
"not theres not enough people who have reviewed this game at this point but ill give it a shot. i think the first thing that needs to be known about this game is that it will take up a lot of your time, i mean a lot. dont start this game if you have anything else you want to get done in the next several hours. that out of the way, this is one of the best turn based strategy game franchises out there and this game only serves to improve the franchise and the genera! the introduction of hexagonal tiles allows for more interesting movements and strategy. over all if you are at all considering this game, just pull the trigger, buy it, and watch your life outside it disappear.",115.0
"latest edition in the fantastic civilization series, this one is just as good as the previous ones. varied victory objectives allow multiple strategies, and the option to play as many different nations with different abilities and units keep you coming back for more. the latest expansion, gods and kings, added the much needed religion feature to the game, making it, in my opinion, a complete package.",142.7
"im not going to lie im just reviewing this for some steam xp. however, this is an amazing game that is fun to play with your friends. it is boardgame-esk in playstyle and can take quite some time. 10/10",81.7

"this game is more addictive than crack. i will not stop until every hex in the world is mine! paint the world!!! just one more turn...",238.4
"its a fun game. lead civ victory or death. 5 different victories. break laws of earth soch as aztecs rule world. no eygiptians only a few or many civs. be who inspires you. personilities based on how they were in real life. either you canquer the world make world peace or find a new palnet to live on.",117.1
"it was a great game for the short time i played it. it is much like aoe, but mixed with risk, it is lots of fun. im not so sure its worth $30, but im tempted to get it. im getting the demo immediatly. 5/5",4.7
"i got three things playing this game. time leap, joint stiffness on my hands and waist and a great fun!",17.1
"so mnay hundreds of hours, greatest game in all history up to its own time",406.0
"fantastic game, very well balanced and alot of fun in general. difficult for begineers to civlization though, there are plenty of guides and to my experience just playing on your own your way ends up to be the most fun and addictive gameplay instead of you just using a tactic that everyone else uses and trully ruining the purpose of learning the game your way, just like any individual shoulf play it, but thats only one mans opinion.its a great game, i have 510hrs played of it, and i taught myself everything about the game even though it was my first civ game i had ever played without using the internet xd.",820.4
"this is the best stategy/tactics and tremendously complicated game i have ever played. so, if complex stategy is fun for you, you will love this game.",30.7
"formed catholic for indonesia then met jersualem. 10/10 best game ever.",109.5

"great game for those people that are really into strategy and tactics.",80.7
"civ v simultaneously simplifies and adds depth to the long-standing civ series. with the brave new world expansion, civ v is now my favorite civ game and favorite turn-based strategy game.",83.7
"do not buy this game without the other expansions!!! otherwise very addictive",40.1
"extremely good, gave me the opportunity to recreate history, i loved!",16.7
"ive played it for a while and sometimes i have to start over because i like the beginning better than the end. its a really good turn based strategy, and i really dont like turn based games.",144.9
"civilization v- the only place where genghis kahn is a peace-lover and mohandas gandhi is a war-monger. sums it up pretty well really, anything is possible here. i said to myself i will do homework today to keep on top of things. yep that didnt exactly happen... went on it about 11am, looked up at the clock and it was half 6 in the evening. oops! in all seriousness, one of the best strategy games ever made.",26.1
"great! this game makes me want to play whenever i see the icon. i havent played all civs but i got the whole set of civ 5 and i must say that the most of them are real fun, nice balance and the different types of winning, are a nice change to the other domination type games! i reconmend getting this game if you like strategy with nice 3d modeling(as well as 2d) a lot of possibilities to win, civs and good ai! the price may be high, but for the fun it payed off! (watch out winning has drug-like effects! ;p)",134.0

"its civ... if youve played it before you know youll like it. if not... do it :)",909.8
"great 4x game that has a great easy to learn hard to master gameplay style.",65.5
"this game is great if you like being systematically  by montezuma/ghengis khan/atilla the hun/napoleon. id recommend getting civ v and all expansions for the best experience. before all the expansions, it definately feels like an unreleased game.",277.9
"i love this game, seriously its a great exercise in thinking, strategy and good old fashioned amusement of historical characters.",713.0
"i have played this game and attempted all victory conditions other than end game (end of game at 2050). and it has been suprisingly fun. although getting the mechanics of this game can be rather difficult for me, as i did not read much in depth when there was a tutorial.",40.8
"another great installation of the civilization series. taking what you liked about the last one and making it better whilst adding new mechanics that brings a fresh feeling to the gameplay. many hours of fun. would recommend.",12.1
"still the best 4x series, v has the on-going refinements that makes it difficult to go back and play 1-4, though i prefer stacking units for combat. the end game is still a bit tedious, especially since the ai is still not very good at automating worker units. i still find limited thrill in non-conquest victory conditions but that may have more to do with my style of play than a deficiency in the design.",127.9
"a great game to play when you have a few hours of spare time. the fantastic gameplay, as well as firaxis games amazing attention to both detail and historical accuracy, make this edition of civ its best yet.",193.7
"its civ v, what more do i need to say? buy it on sale.",31.2
"cant start it up most of the time one of the glitchiest games for me and i no longer own it and must re-purchase it because it hates me.",0.4

"for a research agreement you have to give me 500 gold uranium and oil plus all your gems. 10/10",143.3
"before playing civilization i was skeptical about how addictive it was supposed to be, boy was i wrong. nearly 100 hours in and im terrified of starting another game because of the way weekends disappear. i hadnt played the game without its expansions but with them the game feels fluid and complete with early, mid and late game requiring changes to focus and strategy. highly recommend.",102.9
"i bought this games code on amazon and it wont even open. so, do i reccommend? no. its a scam and a waste of my money and time.",0.3
"i thought: havent played this for a while, 20 hours later, i didnt know what happen worth playing for the infamous just one more turn symptom! 11/10",88.1
"this game is good to play with friends and be horrible to them at the same time",83.4
"amazing game! definetly buy if you can, and every dlc they are all awesome. i think that civilization v + dlcs is better then the new civilization: beyond earth, and if the dlcs wont do it, try mods! als epic.",638.8

"one does not simply play this game for just 30 minutes",203.3
"love it. just love it. so in depth. i played this game in a free trial when beyond earth came out, and i couldnt stop playing it. i now have to wait until christmas before the next big sale until i will get the game, and i am dying. i might not survive... if you have the money, get it.",69.5
"pretty good game! no formal tutorial. an rts game that focuses more on economy and less on warfare",158.5
"civilization 5 is a great game, it will have you saying just one more turn every turn you want to stop playing, one of the best stategy games that i have ever played. a very immersive game, that i highly reccomend to any strategy game fan.",36.9
"apart from skyrim, this game is one of the top 3 reasons i got into pc gaming. i love everything about it and feel like it could never get old. as much time as i have put into it, i feel like i have only skimmed the surface of what i believe is one of the best games ever made. one more turn will be a though that crosses your mind constantly and on into the hours of the morning. if youre into strategy, get this game immediately. my only complaint is the loading times, but that is my only complaint.",164.1
"this game is yet another golden egg given to us by sid meier. his skill at crafting these beautiful games is unmatched. i recomend this game to anyone who loves strategy or any casual gamer.",40.5
"fantastic game, only gripe with it is the ammount of time you can lose in one setting to it",75.6
"dropping nukes and atomic bombs as gandhi is deeply satisfying",41.3
"i love this game and if you think about buying it you should because it is fun and that you can play some many people it to a game worth getting.",42.3

"an awesome game that has been loved for ages through all the games it has",39.1
"civ 5 is a fun game but unplayable in mp because of bugs developers are too lazy to fix. this should not be a full price game with 95% of its core player group who enjoy multiplayer that cant play",354.0
"great game. i have played a few of the civ games and liked them to varying degrees. civ 5 though has probably the best all around game play though. i thoroughly enjoy both the long and short run games. the workshop makes the game even more fun. i also highly recommend all the dlcs as they add a lot of unique features that increase the playability of the game and various scenarios that can be quite challenging",332.6
"this is an amazing game... it trains your brain. ans also the graphics are stunning for this type of game. its a turn-on!!!",1055.7
"this game has taught me one thing; if ghandi cant peacefully protest, hell initiate thermonucleur war. 10/10 for murderous ghandi.",92.0
"love this game to bits, but.... alexander: you are settling near us, stop it! 2 turns later alexander of greece has founded corinth! *looks for corinth* corinth is right below kyoto",211.3
"the best civilization game yet! lots of annoying micro management removed to make the game much more simplistic (in a good way), countless improvements, plenty of dlc, built in mods database, lots of civilizations to play all with unique units. favourite civ game to date. :p",128.7

"highly addicting and lots of fun. you really need to put your planning skills to work in this crown jewel of the series.",219.7
"france declared war on me because i wouldnt insult russia 8/8 m8",87.0
"one of my favorite turn-based strategy games. this is one of those games that you can play over and over and it will never get stale. some of my favorite features include different ways of winning the game, all the civilizations you can play as and compete against, and of course the multiplayer. if you are thinking about purchasing it, make sure to buy the complete edition! well worth the few extra dollars when on sale.",57.6
"this game is a great if you like the genre. it is easy to learn, even if you havent played any other games in the civilization series.",62.5
"this game is incredible! great gameplay, great enemies, just watch out for that ******* ghandi, because he will nuke you into oblivion.",86.6
"friend introduced me to this game and have played 150 hours of it, crazy for this game and cant wait to get civ be and for civ vi",231.3
"it is a really great game and i love it but i was looking at dlcs and i found the packet for 50$ (american) and i got so mad at myself because i realized that there was the packet i could have bought instead so pretty much wasted 30 dollars on the basic game when i could have bought the packet. so this is more to the owners of steam to make something where you can return a game and get your money back. if there is please email me to tell me where it is so i can get the packet instead of buying the packet on top of the basic game i have already downloaded. please",87.7
"now i hate all of my friends, but still play with them anyways. 10/10",350.5
"this game is so addicting... just a sec gotta finish my turn first.... its absolutely amazing, its the best game ive ever played :d (to my opinion then)",550.7
"fun. time wasting fun. havent slept for days. gandhi is a mutherwarmonger. destroy him asap or face anger in the most horrific ways. highly recommend, but only when gandhi is defeated. 10/10, but only when gandhi is dead. fuc him and napoleon.",67.2
"this game has an unrivaled ability to take all of your attention. you feel immersed by how you have to take land from your neighbors while maintaining high happiness. you will learn how to multitask so many different parts of your empire and how to balance building for the future and building for the present.",767.1
"great game, ive already put a 100+ hours on this game. its replay value is very high after playing one match your interested to see how another civs plays. by that time you want to try a game as every civ in the game! with some of the add-ons like brave new world and gods and kings this game becomes very enjoyable and interesting.",134.3
"massive. amazing. simply... exceptional. wait, just one more turn.. 9.4/10 ~ curious cat",58.9
"its a good game, aka good setup,good gameplay and.....yeah,just play it already will ya",7.0
"this is a very good entry-level strategy game for new players in the genre. it is not complicated, has simplistic yet fun combat, and provides enough depth to satisfy veterans. in other words: new players, veterans, and people of all ages will enjoy this game. this is supported by the hotseat feature, which makes it very easy to play with others who dont have a computer on hand, such as a young cousin or sibling. by default, when starting a new game you will start off in the ancient era and your nation will, over many hours, develop up into modern times and past that. you develop your nations economy, military, and expand its borders at home and overseas. so, in a nutshell: its a game where you run and expand an empire, nicely put into an easy to learn package.",154.4
"must play ...... seriously????, help me am addicted :( :).",105.5
"this is based on a game where you can expand you can kill and you can recruit",50.2
"oh civilization v....theres too much to say honestly. if youve played the board game risk before, this is a much more detailed version of that with options other than military domination to lead to victory. if you havent played risk, then this is more like a very complicated version of chess where what you do off the chess board matters too. and if you havent played either of those...this game probably isnt for you. civilization v is a turn-based strategy game at its core, and it is damn good at what it does. however, i do not personally reccommend to purchase this without its dlc bundle, as the main game by itself, doesnt have quite the kick and a lot changes with the dlc additions. i give this game a 9 / 10. definitely worth the pick up if you like strategy or turn-based games.",77.0
"highly addictive game with lots of strategic possibilties. scenarios are fun, but so is developing a unique civilization as you progress through history, particularly when competing with friends.",120.8
"i love this game... so... much... must make army... must nuke... must keep playing for hours",53.5
"perhaps the most immersive strategy/tactical game ive ever played. sometimes i think im bored of it, then i check the list of addons and mods. great game, great community, just be ready to spend a lot of hours on this.",105.8
"the concept of time does not exist when u play this game. 100/10",1023.6
"civ v is a fantastic strategy game. plenty of depth with nearly unlimited replayability. definitely worth a look if your into taking over the world.",214.0
"one of the greatest if not the best round based strategy game out there. be whoever you want to be. a cruel dictator, a merciful king or even gandhi. multiple options of victory and a coop mode. go and grab it! 9/10",328.5
"this game has sucked away more hours of my life than any other game. i find myself returning to play civ v often as it has incredible replay value. every game is different because of tweaks you can make before starting the game and because of the incredible amount of choices and actions you can take during the game. every expansion added new and interesting content, especially the brave new world expansion which added some of the most interesting civs and great balancing and improvements to many game mechanics.",293.9
"the game is a blast in multiplayer. i highly recommend this game for groups of friends to play.",68.3
"ill just play one more turn, i swear... well alexander declared war, i guess ill just nip this in the bud before i go to bed... i mean at this point i might as well go for the captial... ooooh the world congress is coming up in 30 turns... wait its 6am.",535.7

"i need to play this game more. once you get into its very addictive! im glad i got it!",27.0
"sid meiers civilization v is an awesome turn-based strategy game, youll be playing it for hours. highly recommended for those who are struggling to find a game that is very adictive and worth your time (just a heads up when going through the tutorial, you should play up to a time where you think you understand the game enough to create a new world for you can not save your tutorial world). have fun. ;)",24.8
"fantastic game of stratagy as you build an empire. my only complaint is that i sometimes dont realize how long ive been playing... great way to spend a day!",168.4
"i started a game, and by the time it was over the weekend was over. also  gandhi.",56.8
"this game is great.the first few games i played were difficult and confusing, but once i got the dlc, i started pulling all-nighters. if you want a game to challenge you, play this one.",528.9
"vanilla is adequate. gods & kings is useless (included in bnw). brave new world is great. the mods, however, define the reason why i love this game. pro - purchase it and see how quickly 5:30pm turns into 4:45am. con - purchase it and see how quickly 5:30pm turns into 4:45am. con - mods disable achievements (understandable).",528.8
"infact one of my favorite games, this game lets you customize your own empire through power or diplomancy. even science and culture. however without the gods and kings and brave new world expansions (also babylon) the game gets boring. however with the 2 expansions the game is a masterpeice. civ5 vanilla: 5/10 civ5 expansions: 10/10 (also buy complete instead of paying for dlcs later, 50$ for complete yet around 100$ for all the dlc sepreatly)",475.7
"this is just another review about how ghandi is a *%$@ passing through 69/666 would nuke again",129.7

"amazing game, probably will get the complete now that the summer sale has happend, get the complete!!!",47.4
"if you havent picked this game up, buy it. it is a turn based strategy game that will have you one more turn... for hours!",49.0
"excellent strategy game, definitely worth a try! (watch out for derpy ai tho)",50.8
"the only game ive run into where you need to commit a significant portion of your life to play. played one game and by the time i looked up i had aged 5 years.",644.4
"there are mods you can download for the game. there are lots of fun game enhancing dlcs . you can waste so much time on a single campaign or you can play the scenarios. this game makes you use your brain instead of just reacting quickly. this game can be quite challenging given you put it on one of the higher difficulties. and it is very addictive. probably an 8.510 and there is a new one coming this next year.",117.3
"one of my first games here on steam a year or so ago and i cant get enough. whenever im bored i can just start a game and before i know it, 4 hours have gone by. it is really addicting and while i enjoy early game the most (my mac has a hard time handling later game turns) it feels so good to crush all opponents or lead your civ into space.",258.6

"as you can see at my profile - i played just 3 hours, so, you can ask me why did you write this rewiew? go f*ck yourself! but please!.. i played this game for a long time, but in a profile of my best friend, its not very important!.. so, what can i tell you about this game? does this game can be so expensive? does this game can have a dlc? yes, of course! this game is awesome! i can make the great revolution in korea! i can build a pyramide in russia! this is f*cking awesome! more better than other strategy games (beside a supreme commander 2)! i reccomend this game for all people and gamers at this world! really! its true! p.s. dlc with korea is awesome! :3",114.6

"ive spent alot of time in this game and it is fantastic, 5 stars, i only wish you could stack units but i understand why they chenged it i really havent played any of the other ones but this one is great if me and my friends had the time i would bplay more but the singleplayer is still tons of fun. i would recomend this to a friend!",310.2
"this game is probably one of the best games ive ever played! it is probably one of the best strategy ever made that is why it gets a 10/10 from me! :d",193.9

"ridiculously fun, loads of add-on content, insane replayability, theres just so much i love about this game",185.9
"not as fun and flexible as earlier iterations, in part due to style of play. i do love the touch screen support for when im playing on my surface pro 2 though.",27.5
"pros: a game with great strategic and tactical depth that will provide hundreds of hours of entertainment. one of the best games currently available on steam. cons: theres a very long list of minor bugs and issues. the ai is extremely weak. its a long time between turns in the late game, and loading games is very slow. its not a good game without the expansions.",212.8
"this game is the spawn of satan which is why it is so addictive and fun. i hate the last turn syndrome. omg the new one is coming out in a couple weeks!!!!",946.4
"go for gold and/or faith. for gold and faith are the two great movers of man!",482.0

"my go to strat game, brilliant, deep, playable. just grab it.",258.9
"you will need all the dlcs to realy enjoy this (not the maps silly, the game mechanic changeing ones) or it will only be 4/10. i am no fan of the new combat system so for me its an overall 8/10. no must havebut a lot of fun, 3 and 4 are still better imo.",299.4
"this is a great game, but it takes a lot of time to complete a game. and playing with friends is sometimes a nightmare because you have to finish the game online or meet each other in real life to finish the game. would rate 8 out of 10.",231.0
"very fun if you enjoy 4x games. personally, i think its very fun.",26.7
"civ 5 without dlcs is clearly bad compare to civ 4. but with the dlcs its just awesome. we have all good things of civilization with the better battle system ever (cities can defend alone, the range units have really range, just one unit per case... so need new strategy for tis game) finally available on linux ! so 100/100 for me",73.1
"a very good and engaging game, warning!! multiplayer may destroy friendships!",151.8
"it you like turn based strategy...youll love this. it takes sometime to get use to the play, but it will keep you playing til the very end and then youll realize that you have been playing for 6-10 hours",181.6
"one of my favorite turn-based strategy games. its very pretty and has a bajillion diffferent difficulty levels so you can choose whats right for you.",15.7
"it took two expansions for this game to really shine as a 4x gaming experience. trade routes, ideologies, tourism, and the global community all play an interesting role now that add some much-needed dynamism to the game. its biggest weakness is the ai, from constantly offering terrible trade offers and begging for free stuff, to asking you to go to war and then calling you a warmonger after you satisfied their request. tactics-wise, the ai needs a full generational military advantage or more to really bring the pain, and rarely understand how to siege a city without large numbers of troops. i would recommended playing with as many human players as possible. overall, an addictive game that has drained many quality years of my life.",499.4
"this game is the strategy game equivalent of crack",131.1

"i simply cannot get enough of this game. i play very often and for long periods at a time. in my opinion, it is the best thing i have ever played, and i have played a lot. i love the concept, the ideas, the execution, and all the many things that go into this game. i preach the gospel of civilization v to all of my friends. im not the best at explaining why i like it though, so you should really just try it out for yourself.",701.9
"love civ v! unlimited replayability, great modding community and endless hours of fun!",84.5

"great game... more fun with friends, but taking over the world and nuking everyone doesnt get much better.",89.1
"civ 5 is a great turn base strategy game, where you build an empire, and fight others or be peaceful and try to avoid war with others, or be a person that expands there country.",203.9
"awesome turn-based strategy with loads of dlc, definetely one worth playing!",223.7
"as addicting to me as civ 2 was back in college. i think about it, i dream about it, and i totally dont trust napoleon.",30.6
"one of the best games on the market at the moment. can run on low end machines and looks fantastic on high end ones. if you dont have it, i suggest you pick up the gold edition to add to your collection.",40.9
"a highly addictive game that youll have difficulty putting down at the end of the day. even the quickest matches take several hours to complete. dont fool yourself into thinking thats bad, though! the more you learn about how to play this amazing simulation game, the harder it is to keep track of the hours passing by. just...one more turn...",215.2

"ghandi is the root of all evil. i took his city just because he pissed me off.",10.3
"this is seriously the best game ever. get the complete edition for cheap while you can. you wont regret it.",438.3
"this game is slowly ruining my life, one turn at a time. i wouldnt have it any other way",989.4
"two huge thumbs up, especially for the complete edition. civ v offers limitless playability as well as an incredibly fun and in-depth experience. games will take a long- time and you will love every second. play against your friends over the (quite solid) multiplayer to make the experience even more fun. dominate other cultures, rush whatever technologies you see fit, get nuked by gandhi, nuke your city-state allies... civ gives you the freedom to be as much of an  to the rest of the world as you want. or you could be a nice guy and win a diplomatic victory (borrrring). i suggest trying to buy the game while it is on sale (summer sale is a great option, but its been on sale twice in the past year) as it is a little pricey. if you have to pay the full $50 for the complete edition, however, it is still worth it. really amazing game, 10/10.",257.8
"i have spent far too much time on this game, simply because i enjoy the style of gameplay. after many times of playing it becomes slightly monotonous, but it is still highly enjoyable thanks to the different environments and opponents. i would still recomend this game, due to the fun i had conquerring other civilizations.",422.1
"i play this game so much i generally ignore my husbadn and cute kitties because i have to keep taking turns.",459.2

"never really liked civilization, then 4 came out and i was like okay... this is enjoyable but then civ 5 came out, daaaamn son, i was impressed, i was actually really having fun with a turn-based strategy game, wonderful mechanics, wonderful engine and amazing graphics, also nice modding community 9/10",182.6
"you can build the great wall of china, in britain, not historically accurate but its awesome. i love this game it doeant have the massive scale of total war but its much more simple, and you can make a lot of choices ranging from, how smart you want the other civilizations to be to how much yummy yummy iron you want in your area. its great!",60.6
"an excellent game spoiled badley by the fact that it crashes more than a zx80 on a warm day !",434.3

"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",14.1
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",51.1

"excellent game. gant wait for the next expansion.",197.5
"im always resisted playing games like civ because i used to think they where boring or not enough action. man was a wrong, i love this game and it has risen quickly to my top 3 favorite games.",229.4
"getting screwed by ghandi and maria theresa, the epiphany of gaming. great game and even better with friends.",300.8
"why shooting zombies if you can play civ v and become a zombie urself?",123.1
"the game is great, but each play last a looong time",133.8
"well, running it now on ubuntu 14.04 everything works phenomenal and its truly fast on my xmg a704. the vanilla game ist extremely replayable as any good civilization and its got this, one more turn, effect which will keep you playing for hours to no end, completely recommendable, i have not play any of the expansions/ dlc yet but they expand the game a lot it seems, and the price right now gives no place for error.",106.2
"great game with a lot of replayability. i think the main reason i like this game very much is watching your empire, which you build from the bottom, own other civilization when you finish world wonders or annex one of their cities. 5/5, this game is my cup of tea.",126.7
"ill just wait two turns for this unit to be done before going to bed... oh i should probably move him here now that hes done, then ill go to bed... i should probably give my workers orders now, i might forget to next time... well this worker is almost done with his job, ill just wait for him to finish... well since im waiting for my worker, ill make another unit... ill just wait two turns for this unit to be done before going to bed...",291.8

"amazing game, easily the most addictive fts out there.... just one more round!",793.3
"very fun game, but crashes every couple of hours. kind of good because the crashes let me do things like eat and sleep while the game loads up again",6.6
"as a major supporter of turn based stategy games this has been one of my favorite series of games and sid meiers never never to impress. they are fun and very friend friendly for multiplayer gaming. its easy to get lost in the country that you built from the ground up and every game you learn something new. whether it be a useful game strategy, a famous quote, or some useful historical information from the civilopedia this game will always keep you interested.",164.7

"the greatest turn based strategy game ive ever played!",546.8
"ive spent 6 hours on the smallest world with the fastest turn settingsas an egyption trying to bring down america and the iroquios. all i have to show for it is a  of farm land and some boats.  you, civ 5. 10/10",18.7
"great game if you what to waste hours of your life",21.9
"now i may not have the most hours on this game, but it is really fun. civ. 5 is one of my favorite games. i cant wait for the new civ. game to come out. i think most people would enjoy this. the singleplayer works fine but the multiplayer can be a little bit laggy at times.",209.1
"despite being a grand strategy, civilization 5 is very easy to get into. and once you get into it, you wont be putting it down for awhile.",410.2
"this game is pretty much one of the best games ever released. it does, however, have a major drawback: it will ruin your life. i have spent literally hundreds of hours playing this game and have no intention of stopping. anyway, is fun.",415.2
"fun game but not for the people who dont like turn based games",46.5
"this game is by far the best game on steam, i enjoy killing ghandi so much that i could possibly be admitted to a psych ward",157.4
"great game i have had many good time on mp but make sure u have friends that have it to",21.5
"best game to waste all night on. not recommend for people who have jobs with expected results.",478.7

"many sleepless nights lost while sitting at my computer saying just one more turn. it is never just one more turn!",175.5
"i recommend playing this game with mods. i cant recommend trying to finish any games, especially with friends. this game robs you blind of all your time. you will start a game and continue playing it for several hours after telling yourself 2 more turns.",144.9
"this game is definitely worth the buy. you will spend so much time in this game and you will love every second of it.",166.2
"if you like turn-based strategy games you should have it already",113.2
"i give this game a solid 10/10. i am a huge fan of the civilization series. in my opinion it helps me get over stress yet gets intense when your freind for example all of a sudden declares war and attacks you. it is one of the best games on the p.c in my opinion and with the current 50% off deal its a great game to go for.",125.2
"this is the first version of civ ive played, and i know now why my husband loves the series so much. completely addictive.",490.9

"great game! i spend hours without realizing it. great graphics!",77.5
"ive only played a few hours into this game, playing on an easy difficulty to get the jists of things. its amazing the amount of content in this game, it keeps on suprising me!",20.7
"good game but some major differences from the previous civ games. troop placement being one of them. has a few flaws in gameplay but overall worth the money if you like 4x games.",222.0
"one of my favorite games of all time. you can literally spend 6 hours straight playing this game. one more turn is what the game is all about. the dlc also makes the game a lot more fun, and there are a lot of cool mods out there if you find the game becomes a bit bland over time.",218.0
"civilization v is in my opinion the best turn-based empire building game to date. with over 20 civ with their own unique units, buildings and perks you will not be running out of a new strategy to try anytime soon. although i do recommend picking up the two expansion packs gods and kings and brave new world.",92.4
"this game is amazing. if you like those 3rd person world control games, like halo wars or command & conquer, this game is for you.",78.6
"any bundle whcih allows you to not have to pay for the game twice. friend wants to get complete edition but finds it stupid to have to pay $25 for $10 worth of material.",174.5
"i found this game extermely fun and also time consuming. it is like most games of this nature but more about being the better culture and not just an all out war, even though it can be. its a really fun and enjoyable game and it never gets old because there is always something new in every game. only drawback for me is how slow the beginning of the game takes.",45.4
"where do i even begin? this was my first civ game. i have to say that it is fantastic. the core gameplay is amazing. the feeling of starting from nothing and building an empire is not matched in any other way. my favorite thing about this game is that it is turn based. you have time to think about what you will do. the choices you make can cause a ripple that will last thousands of years.",171.1
"the best strategy game ive ever played, multiple aspects that make this game fun and entertaing.",77.5
"the epitome of strategic world domination. risk wishes it could be this engaging. religous domination, check. military domination, check. turning those backwards foreigners into walking culture consumers, check! its got it all baby.",82.2

"i recomend this game to people who like strategy and dont mind taking a day to complete 1 game my friends who are major fps players didnt like it.",5.2
"if you play this game, you have no choice but to play it for hours on end. ive never had a civ v session that lasted less than 3 hours. i love it, though.",238.5
"civ. 5. the best turn based strategy game out there. of course, with beyond earth out now, its time is done. its still a really fun strategy game!",33.8
"this game needs a caution label to warn people about how addicting it is",24.1
"to be honest, i learned more about world history in this game than in school. then yet again, video games are always more interesting than an old man reciting facts out of a thirty year old textbook.",293.9
"incredible civilization game. the gods and kings expansion makes it even better. a very addicting and fun with hundreds of hours of gameplay (literally because i have over 200 lol)",302.1
"a very good game, i really like the turn base system that they use and i enjoyed the way different nations special troops and passive bonuss work, i would recommend this game to everyone",54.9
"this game is a really good game. there are a few people that hate on it, but as you can see, the reviews are overwhelmingly positive. the graphics arent bad. at all. you can see the soldier units move and attack each other, you can see the workers making whatever youre improving, and you can even see the wonder buildings inside of your city. very cool. i really like how this was made. the only thing i have a problem with is that in late-game, it gets really laggy, but thats probably because im on a 5 year old mac laptop. but it still runs really well early game, and i really like it. i feel like the money i paid for civilization 5 was well spent because i can get a lot of hours of playing from this game. there are many different things you can do, paths you can take, and things you can build. every game is different, which is why i really like this game. id reccomend this game. 11/10.",146.7
"the game was disapointing because it was not as good as civ 4 (or any of the previous civ games) out of the box so i recommend you buy any of those instead. the problem is that the base game is incomplete and dull. essentially it is civ 1 with fancy graphics but without the coolest feature (being able to build a palace if your people love you). the dlcs which may restore some of the features of civ 4 should have formed part of general patching so i refuse to buy them since they are also stupidly expensive for what they appear to offer. i uninstalled it afte a few days and if i ever feel like a bout of world domination i dig out my copy of civ 4 over this.",72.6
"excellent game. i cant say anything that hasnt been said probably a dozen times already, so i will just give civ5 another thumbs up.",981.5
"great game to pass the time and play with friends. set up alliances between your friends or betray them and kick them while they are down.",117.0
"highly addicting game. another must own game. got it on sale couldnt pass it up.",196.9
"before i knew it, 7pm was 3:45am ... great game! just ... one ... more ... turn ... p.s. highly recommend the expansions gods & kings and brave new world.",53.2
"by far one of the best game series ive ever played. theres endless hours of fun in this game. yet some would probably prefer earlier versions of the series. regardless if you manages to get sucked into this franchice, youd have endless hours of fun with it.",140.6
"excellent way to lose many hours of your precious life and not regret a moment!",116.1
"i cried when nagisa died at the end. really sad stuff. then oshio died too!!!! this is the saddest anime i have ever played",20.3

"this game is one of the best 4x games ive played, without a doubt.",53.8
"once again, a civilization game lives up to its one more click. extremely good, but a massive productivity drain. dont install on any computer you want to do any work on.",39.8
"gandhi just made war with me and sent a destructive robot,but sadly he falls by 20jets attacking it,best strategy game under turn based ones,the game that all pc gamers need to play atleast once",67.7
"the gameplay is quit bareboned without the dlcs. ai is plain stupid even on hardest dettings.",87.8
"civ 5 is a great game and i definitely had a lot of fun playing it. that said, the game can feel a bit lacking in content sometimes, especially in the endgame. this really hurts the replayability and i would not recommend the game without the brave new world dlc.",352.8
"i highly reccomend buying this game because i have only played for a few hours but i am practically addicted to it and im looking forward to buying beyond earth",7.1

"this game will get you playing for a long time, at times it gets old and i play some other game but it always comes back at any moment to be a fun and entertaining game. the dlc are slighty expensive but it puts a lot more purpose into the game and makes it all around funner. i would for sure recommend this game.",293.4
"great game! everything is so balanced and stratigical. it also is great fun with friends to see who would win a war. ;) i really like the technoligy in this one. the best out of all of them in my opinion. i notice some ui bugs every now and then though. rating: 9",66.8
"played as rome, found gandi, he nuked me, i lost looked at the clock saw it was 4 am 12/10 would bang again",36.9
"peaceful strategy game with fantastic music, wonderful quotes from famous people, and amazingly accurate historical information within. due to its slower and highly strategic gameplay, its probably not for everyone. but it is easy to learn; it plays like a much like if chess, risk (stratego), and warhammer 20k had a baby; but with historically accurate units and structures. however, be aware that this game is a horrendous resource hog. no matter how powerful your machine, this game will slow it down.",393.4
"hours of fun. :d trying to get all the acheivments is gonna be tough, but well worth it ^-^",15.3
"very good game that gives you the chance to establish a nation to stand the test of time. conquer the world or dominate it culturaly. wich ever way you go a fantastic ride to glory",67.3
"probably one of the best turn based city building games i have ever had the chance to play. filled with charm and smoot controles makes this game truely one of the best expirances i have had in a long time. i truely recomend this game to anyone who wishes to try this ganre of games and add the expensions to make the expiriance even greater.",104.8

"really enjoying civ 5, after buying it for the summer sale. its quite different from previous games, but i still love it!",10.1
"the pros are (as always with the civ series) the accessibility, sense of progression, and subconsciously creating a narrative with each new game. the biggest flaw in civ 4 makes a return in civ 5...the ai. the ai simply isnt good enough at playing the game, so the challenge has to come from the player being statistically handicapped (or playing online). at least one other 4x game enjoys a big advantage when it comes to the ai.",333.6

"great game for people who loves history. this game improve my score on history.",6.8
"civilization v, probably one of the greatest example of a sid meier game. this game is very additctive and fun to play. it is also very easy to pickup, but is hard to master. with a great amount of world leaders and strategies to choose from, there is no doubt that you will have endless fun. i give the game a 9/10.",89.8
"if you have the patience for a great strategy game, then there is no reason for you not to get this game. it offers many diffrent wyas to handle situations depending on you play style or mood at the time (from making friedns to launching nukes at your enemies). 10/10 just dont trust gandhi whatever you do.",281.7
"it is a fun amazing game with so many different paths to chose from alone it works for hours and hours of fun and with friends years :)",33.3
"in what other game does your friend and ally throughout 3/4 of the game (ghandi of course, nobody else would ever do this) all of a sudden betray you, nuke your empire to the ground and send in giant death robots to mop up whatever units that your technologically inferior production starved half burning cities are able to produce. lesson learned, never trust ghandi. i 100% recommend to everybody.",813.1
"10/10 this game is really addicting, mostly because once you start a civilization, you have to see it through to the end. be careful when playing this with friends because one time, i played with my friend trent and he got really mad at me because i attacked his civ and then we were mad at each other for a whole week. i dont recommend playing this with friends, but its definitely a good strategy game.",222.3
"games like this dont really need reviews do they? everyone who likes this kind of game already owns it and has 100+ hours on it.",392.6
"being a huge fan of civilization revolution on the console, i was expecting great things from civ5; it did not dissapoint. having bought 5 other games from the steam summer sale, this is the one that i got really hooked on. this game is extremely addicting, i couldnt get off the computer for hours. if you love strategy or turn based games (like me of course) then this is the game for you. warning: the games takes hours to finish if you are a rookie, you probably should only play if you have time to waste. if i could give it a higher rating than 10/10 i would.",32.0

"i waited years to get this game because i didnt like the idea of a hex based combat system. that was a mistake; despite being tactically useful youll quickly forget the shapes are even there. dont make the same mistake as me, buy this great game. if its on sale, even better.",217.8
"i love this game, it is my go-to when i cannot decide what to play. the pace is as quick or as slow as you need it to be. you can play an intense round of world-domination, or you can go for a leisurely cultural victory inbetween errands and household chores. i wish i could say specifically what i like about this game, but it is a combination of little things that keep me coming back. i like the music, the way the ai rulers feel real, i like how i can easily play with my friends on steam. after a rough day, civ 5 gives me the chance to annihilate my enemies, in style.",439.7

"as i get close to breaking the 500 hour mark, i am still as amused and entranced by this game as i was in the first hour. i recommend this game to anyone who loves both real time and turn based strategy gaming. its darn addictive and worth every penny, even if it isnt on sale.",444.0

"an amazing turn based stratagy game with a huge amount of gamechanging decisions to make, expecially with all the dlc which i highly recomend. the only thing i dont like is how even now there is still a few bugs left in muliplayer including the trading bug which can completly wreak the game for you. but this only a small isue and means nothing if you are playing with trusted freinds. over all the game is great fun expecially with freinds and provides hours of fun. 10 out of 10",502.9

"with two expansions civilization v is absolutely amazing. yes, its a little bit complicated for beginners, but with every new turn youll be more and more addicted. shut up and give your money!",181.2
"civilization: a great big black hole of lost time... which we happily keep diving into. 10/10",264.8
"great game, stunning graphics definetly improves on civ iv",135.0
"i started playing sid meiers civ games at civ 3, when the gold edition was only like $5 at target. i fell in love. i loved conquering puny civs and basically being a dictator. as i matured, so did my style of play. i now try to go for diplomatic, cultural, or scientific victories. this leads me to one of my few problems with the game, the penalties you take for going to war. its so hard to be the dictator of the world when you cant even build reinforcements after destroying one city. so if you enjoyed earlier civ games solely because of the world domination factor, you might not enjoy this game. if you enjoy civ games because you theyre awesome, then you will not be disappointed. 10/10 would bang... play again.",59.8
"civilization 5, it is hard to stop your self. the addictive game play goes on for hours in one match. then when you finish that match you play a billion more with differnt options for fun! 10/10, the only rts i can play!",268.9
"best turn based strategy title there is, 2nd to chess perhaps. and when compared to the predecessors, the designers have definitely worked on making the alternative victory strategies more viable. however the ais negotiation capacity and reasoning still leaves much to be desired for a game that appeals to the machiavelli in us.",160.8
"this is game is good. perhaps too good. as in, youll continue to play just a little more till you realize its 3 am for the 3rd consecutive day. the randomized maps, different scenarios, different victory conditions and ways to play make it very replayable. definitely give it a try.",32.9
"once youve played this version youll be converted to hexagons forever. just a fuller, more varied version in every way.",189.0

"a relaxing, immensely stimulating, and imaginative game. i recommend it more highly than anything else i own; wtih 274 hours currently on record, it is by far the game ive played the most. managing empires with the highly varied gameplay of random maps to explore and different alliances to make ensures that, at least for me, it never gets old. difficulty ranges widely as well. its the kind of game that can be played anywhere and is fun to show people. playing with friends is a blast, as you ally and compete on the global stage. if i could pick one game to play for the rest of my life, it would be civ 5.",289.0

"civilaztion v takes some time to get used to, however once you do it is so much fun to play. the turn by turn play style allows you not to forget about certain areas or cities that need work. overall it is a fun game to play which for me takes a good long time to finish.",142.4

"when i first got a pc this was the game i was wanting most. i have spent contless hours offline just trying to do it all. i love the game in ways i can never decribe. if you enjoy any other civ game (even civ revolution) get this game.",177.4

"if you are a fan of the civilization games, dont let this game fool you. no you cannot stack units like previous versions, but there is such a layer of depth involving unit placement and strategic attacks that makes this game much more than any civ game that ive ever played. the dlc packs add a new level to this with religion and tourism, but the multiplayer aspect does need some work. mostly the connections can be quite bad. so save often if you are hosting.",209.6
"this game is awesome if you love controlling a nation and turn based strategy games. it can alos teach you alot in the games civilopedia. if you prefer fast paced games this isnt really your game, but if you like patient games that require you to strategize this is your game to play. steam workshop adds alot of cool stuff to the game and if you have the expansions such as brave new world or gods and kings then the games depth and amazingness increases triple fold.",170.2

"highly, highly reccomended. the sole creator of the one more turn tag on steam, if youre into stratergy or board-games or any kind of management or, hell, even if you just like human history and general conversation? civ 5 is a game for you. its simple yet elegant, complicated yet easy to play. its like risk and sim city put together in a multiplayer sensation. be cautious though: the game only comes alive through the dlc, so expect that additional cost tagged on. not a game for the poor of wallet or poor of time, but if you do have both - then it is highly, highly reccomended. this here is a good game.",165.4

"this is amazing, a huge improvement over civ 4. the graphics are way better, and the hexagon like grid system makes it alot easier to move around. you can see mountains through the fog, the game no longer continually nags you to build unit a when you want unit b, gameplay is fast and fluent and it steam workshop support is a big plus. my only issue is that there is no way to turn off the camera moving when the mouse is at the edge of the screen. i seriously recommend this to anyone who has played any previous civ game, or any fans of the rts genre",1.9

"great game! turn based strategy reaches its maximum level in civilization series and civ v inherits all basic characteristics of previous games, adding some new game mechanics that render the game even more enjoyable. good variety of units and buildings, good managing of technological improvements, interesting combat mechanics... those are just a few aspects that make the game worth to be played. possible improvements may be related to greater customization of units and building for each civilization, not just 1 or 2 unique units, but maybe a complete unique tree of evolving units, several unique buildings or dedicated technologies, just to differenciate the gaming experience for each selected civilization. multiple end goals make it possible to define your own strategy of winning, without requiring you to obliterate your enemies or expand throughout the whole game map. cant wait for civ vi! :)",184.5

"wish it had the civ iv sound of it. baba yetu, and leonard nemoy but great game still similar no stacking of units like in iv, the expansion packs are worth it also. the scenarios are hard, and the achievements are (good luck) impossible to get them all.",315.4
"great game. addicting. fun. youll never notice hours fly by.",274.5
"a really cool game that is extremly addictive. would recommend this game to anyone who loves turn-based strategy games.",449.9

"its a really fun game to play whit your friends. but that if ur not going cross platform. allways out of sync so you cant play as a pc user whit a mac user.",330.9
"i sypothize with the people who dont have this game. i have played civ since civ 2 and i still love it every time i play a new one. you play as an empire crushing all in your path with whatever weapons you see fit :d. want to watch the world burn? let your plains rain nuclear warheads on the heads of our enemies. want to seek peace and prosperity? go diplomatic and give your resources to everyone you meet. want to achive a sience victory? be the first one to go to space. the possibilites are endless. i however prefer to see my enemies destroyed at my feet.",104.6
"following the release of brave new world, this is as addictive as ever, brave new world really fixed the end game which was somewhat lacking. the diplomatic victory is unfortunately still very easy to attain, so i leave that turned off, but the revamp of the culture victory with the introduction of tourism really helps the game where the culture system previously only really served to expand your territory.",452.5

"a lot of fun multiplayer or singleplayer i recommend this game if you want a strategy game to play offline, it has a very high replayablity. the ridiculous situations you can find yourself in are amusing enough but that is just icing on the cake the feeling of toppling a rival nation is quite rewarding.",118.9

"my sleep cycle has never been the same after a good dose of civ v. multiplayer is a bit heavy to play with constant lag issues.",136.5
"good game. the best thing compared to civ4: the improved combat system. game design took the direction of turning the franchise from an empire building simulation game, into a dumbed down strategy game the thing i didnt like.",90.7
"one of the best games ever played, is so fun with friends but is also fun on single player. the long hours put into one game makes it very rewarding once the game has finally finished what i love about this game.",33.8
"best rts game ever. first one ive played was tzar, and that was a long time ago. this is so much better. 5 stars",114.2

"i love this game so much! it was totally worth what i bought it for. i love both the graphics and the gameplay. i love how mods are very easy to access and use. the expansion packs make the game even more fun. this game could make a wide range of people happy.",669.6
"a really great game. dont be put off that its a strategy game and turn based. easily one of my favourite games of all time and im a massive fps/rpg fan. i want to give this a ten but the only thing thats stopping me is the learning curve and how the game can take up alot of your time but you know what... it. 10/10 shag",28.8
"this is one of the most addicting games ive ever had. a must own for any rts fan.",174.8
"a massive game which brings several new features to the franchise, most importantly fresh combat mechanic. its been a year since the original release, and we now know that this title has set the standard for turn-based strategy games for years to come. it boasts fantastic art, a wealth of background information, countless possible paths to victory, infinite replayability and various difficulty levels which make it accessible to everyone from casual gamers to hardcore geeks - who will also appreciate the huge content readily available from the community workshop right here on steam. to put it short, if youre at all into strategy games, this is a title you need to own.",654.0
"civilization is by far my most favorite series of games ever made. civ v lives up to a great tradition and more. you will lose yourself in what seems like a simple game on the surface. it can be a complex or a easy as you want to make it. playing twice is never the same.",52.5
"very long games make 10 hours feel like 2 hours. pretty ridiculous ai difficulties, doesnt seem to get any harder",268.5

"this game keeps getting better with each expansion. one of my favorite games of all time.",102.5

"ever think of what would happen if ghanghi wanted to blow up the world? ever want to pit germany agains egypt? ever wanna make it so the azteks won the space race? well look no further, all this and more can be done in game, not to mention the mod community if massive, to the point of having msf and madoka duke it out over the worlds water. but i digress, this is a great game.",95.1

"i can never get enough of this game. i beat my friends all the time!",349.9
"it has a steampunk mode...i mean what else do you need?",42.2
"ive never been so addicted to a game. i think the reason is is a real strategy game and its complexity keeps it interesting.",471.6
"this is a stratigic turn based game. there is more than one wy to with this game. anywhere from world domination to a sciece victory to a culture victory. it also has many different leaders. each leader has a special unit or building and some are better for different strategies. play with friends or aginst a few ai characters. each match or game(whatever you wanna call it) is long. you can have the game have a random map and ai count or have a custom game aginst ais. there is also a save feature in which you can save and come back later. its not an autosave, but none the less its a save feature. i recomend this game to anyone from a casual gamer to anyone that likes competing.",145.2
"not as good as civ 4 was, but still great in its own right. if you havent played a civilization game before, try out the demo. if you dont like the demo, get civ 4 instead. if you have played civilization before, well then... its ing civilization! what more do you need to know?",401.1

"the first civ game i ever played, civilization v just completely impressed me in every way. the game has that just one more turn addictiveness and is very rich in gameplay. i highly recommed to those who like civ games.",224.4

"mmmm reminds me of risk but super detailed and on the computer!!! got to love old school turn based strategy games!",91.9
"when i first got my hands on sid meiers civilization v, my life became a fight. i dont mean i was struggling to guide my civilisation to global renown, languidly picking my way up the research tree, sending little men to die in little wars. it wasnt that kind of fight. i mean i was fighting not to click the icon that led to the game that led without fail or mercy to me entering a kind of strategy fugue, which id emerge from, hungry and dehydrated, between three and seven hours later. to say this game is addictive is like saying that dry toast is edible. of course it is.",41.6
"this game is brilliant. the problem with turn based games is that they can get a bit dull if done poorly. civ 5 does a great job, really only with bnw (brave new world), which is not a point in its favor. however even without bnw this game has enough tension in combat to keep me hooked.",492.3
"civilzation is one of the world reknown strategy games that have come a long way since their first civilization. civ v is by far the best strategy i have played and am impressed by how far the game has come since its first release civ i. if youre looking for a challeng involving strategy, tactics, economics and combat then this is the game for you!",201.3
"sid meiers civilization v is a great game filled with hours apon hours of entertainment. civ v is a turn baised strategy game, it involves skill, knowlage and commitment its also a great game to play with friends. some of my favorite things about this game is the strategy behind it and the mods made by the community. i would also recommend the dlc for this game, the dlc adds a lot of fixes and new mechanics. enjoy - millerman",220.8
"this game... so addicting, you lose track of the time and its only after youve finished the great fun of it that you realise its been 6 hours. definitely recommended.",245.7

"i love this game. i ve put over a hundered hours into it and could ( nand will) put hundereds of more. very good game if you like stratagy games, and the expansions add a ton more content and replayability.",105.9
"because nuking a pre industrial civilisation, that is no threat to your plans, never gets old",49.1
"if you are looking for a stratagy game this is the one, great gameplay and graphics make this perfect for any stratagy fan. although many many mid to late game units are semi useless, looking at you tanks, but aside from a few minor oversights it is a well balanced srtatagy game that i would recommend to any friend. also if you plan to buy this game dont buy it on steam go to target and buy the game of the year edition, it comes with alot of the dlc for less money.",6.2
"i first played civilization when i was very young. i didnt understand it, at all. it was far too complex for me at that age. as the years went on, i always heard about civ, and how fun it was. when i looked up gameplay trailers though, i thought, theres no way id enjoy that. i was wrong. eventually, i bought the game on a whim, because a friend suggested it to me. i figured, why not? it was on sale. this game redefined strategic gaming in my eyes. the thrilling political aspecs, military, and multiple victory methods. its nothing like i thought it would be. although it is slow, considering the game style, its still thrilling. ive spent hours sitting and strategizing my next move agains the enemy. games can take days to complete. it truely is amazing.",15.4
"turns out gandhi can make nukes in the 1500s. overall 10/10 great game.",108.1
"this game is like a more complex settlers of catan!",20.0

"one of the best games i have ever played. you can sink hundreds of hours in this game and not get bored. in addition each of the major expansions add a nice level of dynamic.",1035.4
"the pinnacle of historical strategy games, civ is known for deep, engaging gameplay. this is my first go at the franchise and i have spent many nights until 3am trying to push towards a space shuttle launch, or pushing enemies off my turf. so many civilizations (each with specific bonuses, and more available as dlc), maps, and modes make this a great value at any price. just look forward to losing some sleep...",170.3
"dont worry, you can always eat/sleep/socialize right after you finish this turn... or after this turn.... okay, after... well, you get the idea. its addicting and time consuming...",67.9
"pretty bad for my classes. pretty good for my empire.",31.4
"dispite the fact of war being a little to server punishement (i dont mind my people mad just i am disappointed that if you go to war every one but you allies and friends will want you 6 feet under) this is a intensly fun game and it is much more intese with mods because, you dont have a clue what to expect. if you want most of the workshop addons though you need g&k and brave new world dlcs but you will still have fun vinilla style.",201.9
"i spend more time on this than i do jacking off, and im a single teenage boy. 12.14/10",148.3
"awesome game! i play it all the time and it is an amazing pass-time for college. i cant afford all of the dlc, but im saving up for it, ive heard that its a complete game changer!",239.0
"civilization v is the fifth installment in arguably the best stratgy series ever. though people argue that its prdecessor, civ 4, was much better. but is it really. so in civ 5 you essentially pick an emeror ie; napolean and build a civilization. people say that civ 4 was better, because there were much more elements. yes, in civ 5 they did take a lot of eleents that civ 4 had, but if you are willing to get the dlc brave new world, you may get that civ experience that you were wanting all along with better graphics. you should definnitely pick this game up if you havent, you can get it really cheap of amazon or in the steam sales, in my opinion this is one of the best strategies out there today.",71.6
"one of the best turned based strategy games available. hours can seem like minutes once your hooked.",27.8
"this game will drag on and on, its not entirely fun as all nations will eventually be te same overall, with less stategy and more power play that anything else. but if you like micro manageing and controling a nation its yours to mess around with. i must warn you though, it is not worth the money",141.6

"this game never ceases to entertain me. when i first bought it, i didnt have any expansions for the game. i played it a lot, and thought this is so fun. what else could possibly be added to this game? its so perfect. then i bought the brave new world expansion, and i see just how much more epic this game can be. this game can even be educational (but who cares about that). overall, i give this game a 9/10!",271.7
"only in civilization can attila the hun be the most diplomatic leader known to man.",30.5
"i dont understand how i have played this game for so long in the two days i have had it. this takes me back to age of empres: age of kings but just adds more visuals and a such a good games mechanics formula that i cannot even comprehend how addictive this game is and how long a game of civ actually lasts. it feels like i am living out the civilisation with how many hours i spend making scenarios happen like americans vs native americans and england vs germany. will not be able to put this game down any time soon.",15.3
"a very well-made turn based strategy game that those with an interest in history will appreciate. your goal is to create a civilization that will stand the test of time which can span from the rise of man to the modern and future ages. with many options to choose from, you can go about the task in any way, influenced by your choice of historical figures, each representing a different civilization. the gameplay is incredibly long. while the game may go quickly early on, once you become familiar with the mechanics and all the various things you have to keep track of, it can take hours to finish a single game, possibly days. of course, you can always save and resume later. single player scenarios change up the game, providing you with special goals, restrictions, and sometimes different figures to use, along with customizable options for free play games to keep the game interesting.",238.0

"civ v is a truly amazing game that once you started simply cannot stop. theres no such thing as a short civ game. you sit down at 4pm thinking youll only play for an hour, then you glance over at the clock and notice youve spent the last 4 hours locked in a slow-moving land war against france. i feel like civ is perhaps the best strategy games i have ever played, or at the very least in the top three.",100.6
"pretty much a perfect turn-based strategy game. dont care much for wars? defeat the enemy with diplomacy and science! dont care much for science? roll over the enemys lands with your tanks and crush them under your iron fist! no two games will play the same as the maps will change and each civ has its own personality. the replayability is endless with each game pretty much having its own storyline as you play, making allies and working together, or even betraying them! the possibilities are never ending! plus with the community constantly adding content via the workshop, the game is always expanding! 10/10",75.4
"great game for excercising your brain and micromanaging skills. however the ai leaves a little to be desired with their extremely one-sided trade offers and tendancy to denounce you whenever you lift a finger against another civ, including civs that they are also currently fighting or even to defend your own empire.",73.6
"this game is really magnificent good game to play either alone or with a group of friends. beware though, if you think you are going to play a fast game of civ5 you are in for a big suprise, the games tend to stretch over several days (for me at least), it took me more than 8hours just to play trough the tutorial, and i loved every second of it. 9.5/10 go buy it!",39.4

"if you like games like simcity or the previous versions of civ then i dont need to explain why this game is so great. if youve never played this kind of game then this is a good intro to the city/civilaztion management genre. this is by far the easiest yet simple version of the civ series to date. great graphics, a awesome user interface, and easy to use. set a game on marathon and youll easily burn 10+ hours on a single game. the amount of options available make it a different experience every time and with the inclusion of gods and kings dlc, well lets just say you have plenty of room to try new things. a must have for any strategy gamer.",18.4
"ive been playing civilazation since civ 3, ive played all of them and i have to say...they got it right again. its definatly not the most complicated game ever, longest playing game, and it dosent have the most depth but it has just enough of everything to make everyone from the most casual gamer to the most serious strategist. the mods are great, the ai isnt to smart but smart enough to be fun to play with, and the community is amazing. id recommend this game to all ages and all skills, its rich in history and all around fun! the world is your playground ;) enjoy...",422.9

"i can already tell im going to lose weeks of my life to this game. a must buy.",23.0
"this game is amazing as a stand alone but the dlcs add to the experience, sadly the downloadable content is the same price if not slightly more than the game itself for very little added. personaly if you ask me we shouldnt have to pay the same price for the dlcs that we did the game but hey there enjoyable n if you play civalisation v enough they do pay for themselves in playability. so overall the game is great and the dlcs add tones of new units and policies and completly change the way you play, its the perfect game for those who want to build a lasting empire and fend off against power hungry enemys as well as develop a relgus background threw gods and kings dlc to maneging trade routs and protecting them on brave new worlds. no matter your play style you will be challenged",373.8
"wow this game is truly astounding! as a gamer i like variety of games but, i have never been a true fan of turn-based strategy games. i decided to give it a try and now this is all i have played for the past 2 weeks. this game challenges your mind, you can research technology from increasing your military power, scientific knowledge, economics and more. it leaves you wondering should i focus on military incase of attack or focus on economics to expand my empire? it really can kick your  should you choose wrong. overal i give it a 10/10. get it",117.2

"it is easily my favourite game on steam and recommend it to anyone who would like to take control of, you guessed it, a civilisation. in this turn-based strategy game, you start off with two units, a settler and a warrior. once you have settled your city, you go on to build various buildings, units, wonders, research technologies, expand your territories, settle more cities, deal with a simple (but compelling) relationship system with other civilisations, conquer or even just trade. although the tuturial is detailed and time-consuming, i learnt as i played but managed to pick it up easily. i highly recommend this game. 9.5/10",297.2
"one... more... turn... it might take you a while to get hooked on civ. you might have owned the game for 2 years and only played it a few hours. but one day you will create the most powerful empire ever and conquer the world and from then on youll be hooked. this game has amazing replayability, and it is lots of fun for new players and experts alike. sure once youve played it for a while it may become a bit simplistic, but by then youll find yourself clicking next turn against your will and forever trapped in a world of culture, warfare, diplomacy and... epic civilizations. definitely worth the money. also brave new world and gods and kings add a lot to the game and i would highly recommend them.",234.5

"okay, first you need to know that ive played everyone of the pc-based civilization games since sid meiers civilization first appeared back in 1991. with that said, ive enjoyed each installment in this genre and each has had its pros and cons. civ v is probably one of the strongest entries by a long shot even while it has a number of players of the series critical of several major changes that were made both in game play and with the units and combat. personally, while i was initially critical, too, of some of these changes, with time i have come to enjoy the current version better than most of the previous versions. the dlc/add-ons as well as the thriving gamer modding community for civ v ensure that it will last a good long while on many players systems.",253.9

"just like civilization revoulution but more detailed more  thrown into it, longer, harder, more relistic",52.5
"civ 5 is an awesome strategy game; its definitely the best turn based strategy game ive played. its not like most other strategy games which are just war, civ 5 lets you take any path, weather it is war or peace, and still win. the scale is also much larger than other strategy games; youre building a country on a planet, not making a military base in a mile x mile map. the interface is very informative and there are so many ways to play that anybody can become an accomplished player. there are very few things i have to nit-pick about, but i wish there was a system of authorizing mods to be fair to use and still get achievements, because i have some legit mods i really like, but using them turns off achievements. still, i highly recommend civ 5, but beware, they arent kidding about just... one... more... turn... it keeps you wanting to play it!",34.1

"i havent been into civilization since civ 2, and i must say this one was much better than the last few. the diplomacy tends to work, and combat has been balanced out a bit (no stacking). although, whenever i put the difficult up to prince it seems like the competition has some serious advantages. i managed one prince level playthrough without getting my  handed to me (thanks siam). then again, i suck at civilization. i have never been good at the series, but i do enjoy it when i want a simple strategy game. love those giant death robots.",84.1

"what can i say about sid meiers civilization v? it is seriously one of my favourite games to date. it is an amazing turn-based strategy, that does not feel like either genre! you slowly build up your empire untill your number one, or you get left behind, choose one of the multiple ways to win, whether its world domination or the magnificent space race. i feel like anyone could play this game with or without your friends and still have a great time. wait did i say with your friends? yup it has multiplayer. as you are building your civilization why not invite your buddy? where both of you get to compete with your friends to see who is the better conquerer! i hate turn based games, but this is great game that everyone can enjoy! p.s. and remember, dont trust ghandi :p",15.8
"overall, civilization 5 is an excellent game. its graphics and overall gameplay would make anyone that likes strategy games love this game. you can play it with friends on multiplayer and servers are easy to set up. the only thing i dont like are the dlcs, which are exspensive. nevertheless i highly recommend this game its one of my favorites.",43.5

"i was playing this game and enjoying myslef, 500 hours later i am still playing this game but now starving de-hidrated and sleepy.",635.8
"it was going great until gandhi started nuking me.",111.0
"fantastic game!!! buy it!!!!! i would say though that - although the vanilla game is great - buying the brave new world dlc adds several whole new aspects which really improve it.",347.7
"i do not like having to use steam for this game. i have to reload steam every time i do a malware scan. i would prefer having a cd to play from. also, with steam the game is too slow.",418.6
"this game is one of the best i have ever played, i have never been so addicted to this game! the interface is great, and the game includes loads of civs to play as!",36.2
"as a long time civ player i really was looking forward to this game - but in my opinion it is a huge disappointment. they took something great and managed to dumb it down and make a game with no lasting value.",11.2
"the time flies when i play this ! super recomended!!!!",127.7
"so fun with friends but you need patience and expect things to go to hell quickly if you dont pay attention",144.8
"it was fine when it was released but the expansion packs just made it. definitely recommend.",520.9
"this game is quite possibly one of the best games ever created. it has complex but easy to learn strategy, making the game quite fun for inexperienced and hardened gamers alike. it also gives you hours upon hours of gameplay, with single sessions sometimes taking up to 10 hours! all in all, i would definetly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy, whether they be hardcore strategists or casual gamers (just make sure you dont have anything planned for the next few days!)",108.0
"im a little biased, been playing civ since civilization 3, but damn! i am just as entertained with this series as i was when i was younger. be warned though, if you hate dlc, youre gonna be tempted to buy the brave new world expansion pretty fast. and most of the mods are for the expansion. so if you wanted to play a really cool mod, youre looking at a $60 purchase of the vanilla game, and brave new world together. the game is still great in vanilla though so whatevah, i recommend playing you some civ.",124.1
"brilliant game! you can play one round about 5~10 hour`s. its addictive! a lot of variants to win, such as space program. get it! 9.5/10",30.2

"i am absoltuly addicted to this game. it is a must buy.",182.8
"do you believe that your fit to rule the world. well you have to start from the bottom to get to the top! throughout the game i focused on more then world domination, theres an economy you must mantain, people you must feed and armies you must manage. its not as easy as you may come to believe. but when you crush egypt, or ghandi, or whomever else it may be, you walk away satisfied.",307.2
"my first trun based strategy game i have ever played, and easily my favriote. its easy to learn and easy to play and easy to have a good time.",4.9
"this game is awesome. so many countless nights spent playing.",141.3
"loving this game, its great fun to in singleplayer, and even better in multiplayer. if you get all the expansions, you have an amazing amount of replay-value. ive played over 100 hours yet, and am still playing the hell out of it!",388.6
"a fun strategy game that is easy to learn but very hard to master",299.0
"too many dlcs that contain features that should have been included in the game to start with.",85.7
"fun, i love games like these, i can play them for hours on end. i first encounter this type of game while searching my phone for a decent app game to play, i initially only installed it just to give it a try and was very much addicted to the game. before long i would just play the game over and over again even though i had beat it. so one of its many features is that it has a lot of replay valu to the game. so trying the bigger version of the game was a plus for me, and contains a heck of a lot more content.",38.0
"amazing bringing back good old fun turn base games, with updated graphics, storylines for each playable race is amazing.",152.4
"good game with plenty of gameplay options and replayability. only downside for me is the expansions are a bit pricy at this point. i mean the game itself is the same price as both major expansions. its a bit much. but over-all it is definately worth a play if you are fan of the series or if you enjoy turn-based strategy.",102.8
"a very in-depth game that accepts new players new to civilization. it holds your hand at first, and when you conquer your first city, it feels great. its good, long and great fun.",143.2
"this game gave me cancer, it took everything that was me and destroyed it, leaving me a empty husk as i pour my soul into surviving gandhis nuclear onslaught. 10/10 would play again, goty #nukeswag",226.7
"what a great game, i like that you can win with methods other than barbarically taking over the world. lots of replay value, be careful this game can make the hours zip by!!",194.0
"while the updates to the hex grid, and one unit per tile might seem game breaking and daunting, it really adds to the fun. you no longer require a rolling stack of death to get anything accomplished. with proper army and terrain management, you can take out their entire army with a few smart choices. what else do you need? its still civ at its core.",60.2
"anyone that tries to play this game competitively is literally the worst person",272.7
"i grew up on civ anc civ2... this does not disappoint!",184.5
"it can chew up alot of hours. i love this franchise, but its much better playing multi player (as usual).",87.8
"i sunk over 100 hours into this game and i think that was just the tutorial. this game is amazing. a-maze-ing. with a capital amaze. it has problems, but i cant remember them due to my mind being blown. major time sink. divorce your wife before starting.",127.2
"this is a very good game. almost all my friends have it, so this review is near pointless. i am only writing it to let you all know that once you have aquired the dlc, the levels of fun will be doubled. brave new world (bnw) really brings a new meaning to immersion when you get down to it. without bnw, this game is simply just no where near as fun as it could be. so get bnw. yeah. thats it. have fun.",492.4
"this game is highly addictive and just plain fantastic (especially with the dlc). just...one...more...turn!",160.1
"i spend too much time on this game... its good though, get it, ask me to play it with ya.",284.4
"one of the best game i ever played! you sure need to buy this game.",98.4
"a game of pure class, nothing but enjoyment from your first city to your last.",222.8
"cant... stop... playing... dont judge it by vanilla - the expansions make the game. go for gold, at least. civ v with g&k and bnw offers a million different strategies to try. okay, maybe thats an exaggeration but no two games will be the same, and pretty much all playstyles are valid and do-able. combined with the workshop, you really can play just about any way you like. note: using mods disables achievements. not a big deal for me, but worth noting. with all the dlc, there are now over 40 civs to play as or against. just watch out for gandhi. seriously.",199.8

"always fun to play ruler of the world. at least for a little while.",551.5
"good ole civilization. this is a classic strategic turn-based simulator, however, this one is a little different than the previous civilizations. for starters, you dont choose directly if you want to be a monarch or dictator, instead you adopt social policies that shape these different forms of government. secondly, there is no tile stacking... which kinda blows, but it does make for a more realisitic gameplay. other than that this game maintains its integrity and you will surely lose your soul if you are one of those people that easily get sucked into games like this!",126.8
"this game provides hours of relaxing strategy gameplay. if you have doubts for this game, give the demo a try(the game is much better if you get the dlcs).",173.0
"if you enjoy stratagy games, or want to get into them. i highly recommend this as a starting point for you. with just a little research you can get hooked onto this game. 21 hours played and i bought this 3 days ago. a time waster but a bloody good one. 9/10",165.8
"this game made me suspend my social life for three weeks totaly worth the buy",119.3
"really addictive strategy game with a easy-to-understand ui, even for newcomers in the series. my only con is that the game gets a bit boring after someone gets the nuke, but its just my opinion! 9.7/10",77.7

"once you understand all the ins and outs, it can be quite humorous.",39.9
"this game speeds up time around you. look at the clock and then play some civ then look back, and i guarantee you that at least 3 hours will have passed. i have already lost 35 hours of my life to this phenomenom and i expect i will lose many more. 10/10",42.1

"i have owned this game for about a month, maybe a little more and it is one of my favorites until recently (not saying it isnt good but this is really annoying, still love the game) when whenever i try to load up a save or start a new game, it crashes. besides that annoying aspect, the game is amazing and if you dont own it (one of my friends), buy it.",347.6

"build an empire and rule the world... or get destroyed by barbarians",11.6
"the gameplay stayed the same over the years but why change things if it works?. graphics got better, mechanics got finetuned, things added, things dropped. still a pleasant game for a lazy day at home. ...and no, i dont know either what happened to civ iv :p",80.9
"one of those games that you promise to try for five minuites. only to find yourself still playing it seven hours later. very addictiing, pretty fun and great for people new to the civilization series while challenging for the pros. 10/10",50.5
"if u are a 4x fan i would definitely recommend this game. and likewise if your not really a 4x fan it is still a great game to play. not just hours but weeks of fun. 10/10 from me.",164.3
"i recommend this game, especially with the in-game editor (ige) mod installed. it makes for really crazy scenarios.",142.7
"a great game for stratgey fans, civ 5 on its own is much simpler than civ 4 so fans of the series will not like it however all the issues are addressed in both dlcs and they and a tone of content!!",196.0
"needless to say, civ v is a quality product - tons of content, hours, and i mean hours of gameplay, all wrapped in beautiful graphics and sound. brilliant.",192.2
"looking to kill some time? how much time you got? wanna be locked in your room, in the dark, blankly staring at a computer screen for literally a week straight?! buy this game! its wonderful, really! five stars.",42.3

"if you are new to the civilization franchise, do not let the complexity of the game turn you off. this is a very addictive game and once you get the basics down, you will keep coming back. with all of the different maps and leaders the game is never the same twice. just watch your time, because this is the type of game you can play for hours and not realize it.",115.0

"this game will destroy your life. youll be walking down the street wondering why you dont have to stop and wait for the other players to take their turns, and then youll think, oh yeah, i guess i can go a few more spaces since this is technically a road.",220.6
"this game is my favourite strategy game that i know of. lots of depth, tons of content and replayabliilty, dlc is completely worht it, and with mods you can play this game for days without realizing what time it is. great graphics, beautiful ui, and immersive gameplay creates a must play. do yourself a favour and try this game.",278.4

"great game for spending 30 hours striaght and having fun teh whole time...",282.3
"this game is virtual cocaine and should be governemnt-regulated. it has robbed me of too many days of my life.  this game. thumbs up.",207.4
"it was unclear if this one really beat out civ iv for me, but with brave new world, there isnt a doubt that this installment is the best so far! great for anyone who likes pure strategy!",403.4
"awesome game, totally different feel than four(which i consider the pinnacle of the classic civ style of play). introduces city states love them or hate them. the dlc is way too expensive though. i bought the game pre-release which was a huge mistake and resulted in me paying twice as much for the games content where as people who waited for the complete edition(about two years), get a way better deal still to this day. its cheaper for me to buy the complete edition now which duplicates half the content i already own than to buy the content piece meal which is total bs. good game though.",162.1
"it is really fun, highly reccomend it, even if you have never played a turn based strategy. it has very helpful tooltips to help you learn the game.",60.1
"what can i say about sid meiers civ v that hasnt already been said? beautiful world map, great fun, and one of the best civs made. i really enjoyed bnw as well. would recommend.",90.3
"the king of the 4x! especially with the expansions, this game is just great if you love your 4x. i personally prefer the absense of unit stacking (you can have 1 military unit, 1 civillian unit and 1 naval unit per square). cities have hp which means you dont need to stick your starting military unit on your city for x turns in case a random babarian captures it while you were exploring.",133.0
"fun game play , hardest ai i have verus always a tough fight even on normal. easy to learn and figure out",140.4
"civ v, after all the patches and expansions, has matured into an enjoyable grand strategy game, even if, overall, its argueably a step back for the franchise. the game is gorgeous. diplomacy and trade work are more nuanced than ever. fewer cities and units means less micromanagement and city states create interesting new gameplay. the reduced complexity of most of its systems is apparent after awhile though, at least to me. each civ is really only suited to one or two victory conditions. civ iv allowed you to dynamically change your governmental structure depending on the situation, where civ v just has you accumulate points towards the next permanant perk, without any apparent change afterwards. its still fun to play through many many times and is by no means a bad game, its just not as complex or open ended as its predecessors, and so slightly less replayable than they were, imho.",251.6
"this installment keeps you playing turn after turn till midnight. ;) seriously, once i start, i cant stop...its that good.",45.6
"holy cow i spend too much time playing this but its really a good time-waster. i doesnt even feel like you are wasting time since the gameplay is so rich and satisfying.",10.9

"civilization is one of the best game that i have played and will ever play! it runs nicely on mac 10.7.5 and the game has so much to offer! i greatly recommend it to everyone! still a pity that the leader cutscenes are on minimum settings, which is unable to change on mac. still.. play this game, youll love it!",432.9
"play this game, you philistine. i dont even know how to describe this game. no other game is so well designed. the systems are simple in their ability to be comprehended, everything is boiled down to pretty little icons but the level of complexity behind them is staggering. no other game permits you to so gradually remove your training wheels. and dear god will you need training wheels when you start out.",311.4
"best civ ever all strategy lovers should buy and expose themselves to this game at least 12 hours straight",129.4

"bloody brilliant. it is at its best with the g&k dlc and the bnw dlc.",285.0
"this is a great game, civ. v is bacically a mix of risk and settlers on steroids.",83.4
"never has a game consumed so much of my time. once you start developing a nation, gaining and losing power, showing empathy to captured civilians and crushing destructive and volatile nations - when the music plays as you bring down an empire famed for its culture... when you hear their screams as they flee to their final city... when you continue the march, justified because of their zealous spreading of foreign religion in your lands... until your diplomatic victory has now become a domination.",222.1
"great game! especially if you enjoy strategy games you always have something to do,literally. 10/10",33.9
"ive had this game since it first came out and ive never grow tired of it, the dlcs are amazing and add so much content, and the replayability is endless. amazing game and i cant wait to see what follows in the next civ game.",376.7
"really fun game in my opinion its better with brave new world but even the base game but for 30 extra dollars its tottaly worth your money",172.7
"probably a better jumping-in point than civ iv, but something of a step backwards for the series. this game improves in some ways and fails in many more others, but a good game for those less interested in thinking and planning than civ iv.",221.5

"extrememely fun and time-consuming strategy game. prepare a few hours for one session of this game!",22.9
"i love this game! to the point where i have to limit myself to the weekend or else ill be up all night playing it! its a great turn based strategy, in the more difficult levels you really do need to think far ahead and plot your way to victory! although its quite different to civ 4 it still has the core gameplay and feel of civilization, and over the patches and dlc have ironed out problems that most initially werent happy with. it comes highly recommended from me, but be warned, its also highly addictive.",381.9

"great game! fantastic visuals, realistic gameplay, and decent ai",42.8
"if you havent played a civ game or only played civilization revolution on the consoles, its pretty complicated but its super fun even when youre -30 gold per turn and everything is terrible. its very satisfying to wipe a whole civilization off the map as they try to negotiate peace when theyre down to their last city. its marvelous.",44.1
"great game worth the money, but you might want to wait for a sale like i did 10/10",56.7

"deep down, its really not a different game from the pixelly dos one i used to play late into the night, very badly, way back when. still simple enough for a kid with plenty of depth, a decent learning curve and enough variety to keep you entertained for years. the multiplayer definitely needs some work, still buggy and cant be modded, but single player still has plenty of depth to go around.",245.3

"this is the fifth game in the series, and boy, do i like it. it has most of the regular features from the previous games, but also all-new hex based navigation, which is a little strange at first, but you get into it quickly. this is civ, new and better. 9/10",112.7

"now, im not into drugs - neither as a dealer or a user, but if i was going to compare how it feels to play this game to anything under the sun, it would be a substance called crack cocaine. its heavily addictive, it can keep you up until the early hours of the morning on a high, and of course an overdose can be fatal. in a best case scenario itll be 5am, your 230th turn. youll be in a cold sweat, your heart pounding. your blood vessels clutch tighter than a jews wallet. you hear a knock at the door - its your damn wife. please, come to bed she begs from behind you. you slowly swivel your gaming chair to look at her straight in the eyes, vacant and withdrawn and whisper ...no. she then moves out to live with her mother and leaves you with the god damn kids and a hefty pile of divorce papers. who needs her? youve got civ 5!",130.3

"you can easily find yourself investing way too much time into this one, great game!",21.2
"this is an incredible game. you need to just set aside an entire 24 hours and play one or two games of this in a row, its an insanely fun turn-based strategy. i dont really like turn-based strategies, but this game is just fantastic, the detail that you can go to in customising your civilisation is amazing, and you eventually find a style/empire that you are most comfortable playing as! highly recommend this game to anyone, it changed my mind about turn-based strategies, it might with you too!",163.4

"immersive, detailed. endlessly replayable, especially with the latest dlc, which made the ai much less aggressive. cant recommend civilization v enough.",206.9
"have been a fan since civ 1. i highly recommend getting this game if you love epic conquest and strategy style games. there are so many variables and so many good civs to play as that the replay value on this is endless. if you have never (really?) heard of this game, do not hesitate to get it. be prepared to be unable to find a spot to stop playing. once i start a game, i can hardly stop until it ends. very hard to save and come back to later, but i definitely make time very soon to do so.",414.1

"this game is great, and you should buy it! simple as that.",216.7
"an absolutely amazing game, expertly executed. i really liked the game when i played it and would probably have continued if my friends had bought it too. i recommend you get the dlc while youre at it, changes the gameplay quite a bit centering around trading and culture.",112.5

"highly addictive, typical civ game but more polished.",144.3
"this game is really fun for the stratgeists out there and can make some pretty intreasting fun if you have friends for multiplayer",371.3
"definitely worth the money, its actually pretty fun to play. the satisfaction of destroying another players entire empire is just too great. the only problem i have is that the dlc is a bit overpriced, but that doesnt affect the standard games gameplay. definitely a good game and definitely worth of game of the year.",310.1

"great game but, will be a upgrade for gold editions to complete edition ?",67.4
"purchased when it came out and its cost me 90 bucks thus far good game not worth paying just to make it playable",518.8
"one of the best turned based games ive had the pleasure to play. it runs well though i have had more crashes than i hoped for. the game is fun with friends but can take a lot of time but you can always save it. the only problem i have with (apart from the crashes) is that to fully enjoy the game, you will have to get the dlc, gods and kings and brave new world. though its worth it.",175.3
"great game, still playing for hours per week. still miss some of the features of civ4, like slave states, etc. could really use some additional diplomatic options (like demanding surrender, slave states). and what i havent encountered yet in this version, in older versions if a huge empire lost its capital, it split up in two adding a new nation to the game. would be nice if that feature was also introduced again, or in case of unhappiness for a long time, certain cities rebel and form their own nation (which is actually how many nations were formed).",312.4
"this game is fun. slightly addicting. sometimes frustrating. but still, i like it!",74.7
"best strategy game, easy to play, difficult to master.. i only wish, that ai is more predictible. it feels too much random, actions are without consequences..",303.7
"highly addictive combination of simulation and turn based strategy. if youre a fan of civ, this wont let you down. if youve never played any of the civ series, i definitely think this game wont let you down. its an interesting mix between age of empires and sim city, for lack of a better comparison.",1003.2
"civ 5 is extremely fun, and even a little educational as it mirrors how real-life affiars in the world could go down.",26.0
"its so much better now than it was at launch. great game to just drop some time into.",390.1
"only good if you get the dlc but it is great with goods and kings but best with brave new world great for stragey gamers and history lovers. its very fun and good for multiplay",35.5

"i spend my life in this game, because this game is beautiful and wonderful.",279.2
"cant even play it, starts then freezes on load screen every time. what a joke!",0.2
"would totally reccomend this game to anyone who likes a good strategy game. be sure to get gods and kings as well as brave new world to help enhance the experience!",85.6
"whether youre an old school civ guru or brand new to the series, like myself, civilization 5 delivers engaging gameplay through key choices made during every campaign. tread diplomacy lightly as to not incur the wrath of larger, more powerful civs, or go balls to the wall militarily. i guarantee if you play long enough, youll ache to win as many ways as you can. gods and kings didnt quite fix diplomacy, but the game is directly better because of the dlc.",477.9
"i have sunk so much time into this game since i bought it in the humble bundle. i would recommend it to anyone!",412.9
"ive played strategy games my whole life and this is the most complete game out there. replay value is very high, pro tip - save often...",203.9
"what can i say, civ has been amazing for over a decade!",435.7
"one of my favorite franchises of all time, civ 5 has brought a lot of new and exciting content to the table, and a boat load of changes to boot. while some changes are better than others, the experience of building your nation, fighting for land, trading for resources, and the over all global experience is something great to be a part of. if you see that im online and not playing this game, assume ive been kidnapped and im trying to signal you.",59.9
"dis game better dan choc cake!!!!! must get with bnw and gods and kings",378.8
"this game is amazingly fun even though ive only played a little ive not stopped playing",136.7
"like strategy? like challenge? then you will like civ v. in short it is an improved version of the previous games but with some added content which is also a blast. although i have been playing with gods and kings dlc added on so it may be slightly different with the standard version. also having online is a lot of fun especially with friends as you can have a lot of people playing at one time. its also nice to backstab a friend once or twice for not giving you that bit of oil...but thats just my story. also with a large and active workshop community new mods are fun to use as it only expands more on what civ v offers. although if you are not interested in long game times then you might want to avoid this one for now or get it in a steam sale as games can take hours and even days. although there is saving so you can take a rest but dont think you can rush victory in twenty minutes.",154.2
"i would greatly recomend this game for anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games. youll find yourself addicted to it in a matter of minutes, trying to become the worlds most cultural and military dominate empire. if you are not a patient person however you probably will not enjoy this game, because it takes alot of waiting and planning before you make your next move.",117.3

"wow this game and the depth you can control your civ and your relationships with other civs is really mmmrglmmm. get it 10/10 would buy again.",34.5
"the base game, when first released, was pretty tame compared to the much loved civ 4. gods and kings (gold edition) made this a good purchase, brave new world brings it up to the standard weve come to expect of the series. some pretty big changes in this installment, including hex based maps and the end of the stack of doom, albeit replaced with the blob of doom in some instances.",126.3
"hope you dont have a family or social life if you play this game.",573.9
"this game- for little i have to say im terrible at it. but one thing this game did was impress me with its overwhelming amount of features, ive only scratched the surface! this game seeks to amaze me and delivers which is why it gets a seal of approval. i rate it around 5/5 (perfect score!)",66.1
"excellent game, many hours of play time. brilliant turn based strategy, most fun when played with friends. like risk? of course you do, this is longer, more complex and more fun. for more and longer reviews go to",114.5
"last time can conquer city-state civ through marriage. now cant ?:(",29.3

"this game is one of my favourite strategy games ever",163.3
"this is honestly one of the best games i have ever played. definatley the best strategy game i have ever experianced. the graphics are apropriate for the game and the gripping strategy gameplay is top-notch. i would give it a 9/10.",203.5
"i really thought this was going to be another basic, boring strategy game. i was wrong.",59.1
"if youre having a hard time deciding if you want to buy this game just stop thinking so i can tell you that you yes indeed just need to go ahead and buy it because you will for sure love it",57.7
"to be honest, civ 5 is one of the best games ive ever played. its music is compelling, catchy, and epic. the actualy gameplay itself is easy to learn, and it requires hard-thinking and well thought out strategies to win the game. the variety of different civiliazations is awesome, which each having their own unique skills. its enjoyable, fun, thrilling and addictive. now get ready to lose some sleep when you delve in to the world of sid meiers civilization v. personal rating: 9.5/10",50.1
"awesome game that will keep you saying one more turn.",485.4
"the game is simply amazing! you cannot play for a few minutes as it will quickly escalate to a few hours. the expansions offer a lot and are more than worth the purchases, but the core game will keep you busy for days. certainly reccommend this game for anyone, even those new to the genre.",804.6
"being a fan of the civilization franchise civilization v was something of a disappointment when i first played, however that was because i naive and my expectations wasnt matching what the game was about. after coming back to the game i realize that a lot the features that have been implemented while i was gone and all the expansion pack have turned the game into a solid piece of work. it is fun building civilizations and conquering enemies that have an uncanny capabillity of out doing you at every turn. the technology is realistic somewhat and the non-stacking units take some time to get use. however i would recommend this to everyone who wants to build a nation from ground up and conquering multiple enemies. i just wish that there were more micro government options oh-well still it is a good game to by time and have fun.",352.1
"one of my personal favorites. its not a great sequel, to be honest, but its a solid game nonetheless.",2.8
"the game is ok without dlcs. but with g&k or bnw the game is extremely good and well done. civ+expansion= very good civ alone= ok.",251.2
"civilization v is a fascinating and addictive turn-based game that may be played either solo or multiplayer. the interface is simple and intuitive with plenty of on-screen prompting for most actvities. as you play, you will find such gems as queues for both building or research that help automate your exanding empire a bit, or the advisor panel which helps explain how things work while you are in-game. like any leader it might take a bit to know which advisor is giving you the most important imformation or information that you simply need to know. there are thoughtful comprehensive guides available which help even the newest player to begin to understand the complexities of this game.",344.0
"very good much enjoy, wow. seriously though, i dont know how this game is good, it seems like it would be boring, but it isnt, its one if the best games in my library.",126.1
"this game sure eats a lot of time but the satisfaction it gives is remarkable! since gods and kings the complexity and challenge is greatly improved. a must if you enjoy this sort of thing!",418.8

"warning: play only if you have a decent time to spend. you dont play 14 hours straight in a bad game. 11/10 would recommend.",37.1
"i played the previously sid meiers civilization 3 as well as this one. i love this game obviously. it is like playing chess but with your civilization at stake. but it is not really realistic because the historicial figures are who they are, not who you are. like for example, some of the famous warlord like genghis khan achieved his empire by letting his mongel enemies join him or die, and the roman empire expanded not because of its army but because of the use of making roads that made it easier for the roman soliders to march on in caesars conquest. the game would be made more challenging if the world leaders were forced to follow their ways rather than change with the todays thoughts on the success of civilization building. if only if we could renact history and see if the gamers could create alternative historical worlds based on the strategies of famous or infamous historical figures.",113.7
"awesome game! first civ game i have ever played and i enjoy it a lot. easy to get into and once you start, you wont be able to stop!",91.9

"this game is great. only posting this for the awards",76.7
"amazing strat game i reccomend for player who like strat and are patient",65.2
"if you like turn-based games with a grid-like map then this is the game for you. you get to choose a civilzation which has its perks and then build it from the ground up by creating cities, researching tech, making units, etc. it has an exelent style of gameplay ranging from unit health, to resources around a city, and cililzation happiness. one thing i miss are goverments from early civilizations but overall its an exellent game!!!",108.6
"my girlfriend has asked me not to play this game anymore, as it keeps me from doing anything else. im two months sober from this game, but still... the hunger to turn it on. of-ing-course you should get it.",283.1
"if you like turned based strategy this is the game for you. countless hours fly by without even realizing it. multiplayer is there as well; its fun to get two other friends on the same team and watch your research skyrocket while you gang up on all the other cities. great game, well made, and all round fun to play.",81.8
"amazing game if you want to do a world domination game with friends or a.i.",76.6
"i vouch for this game if you got ocd like me. ill beat it, then say im gonna do it a different way next time around... then i done played it half a dozen times and still wanna try new ways.",292.6
"why havent you bought civilization v yet? you have? well, its time to kill that  ghandi once and for all! play for countless hours by yourself or with friends! you can even play senarios like the civil war. its too overwelming? get to know the game by playing the standard game without the dlc then once you get farmiliar with it, upgrade. 10/10, would civ v again.",132.6
"this game is so ing fun. its a relaxing game to play after a long day at work or a good workout. more fun with friends, like most games. definite buy.",78.5
"a game you can spend hours playing and feel like youve accomplished nothing.",278.9
"dis game iz da shizaye u waz gon 2 work bat wayz funna ! bye it yo",279.0
"this game is addictive. stupidly. many have complained that the game has had too much taken out to appeal to a wider market. ignore them. the changes are for the most part sensible, and improve the flow of the game. the gods & kings expansion tweaks things further and makes the whole package feel more complete. ok, so diplomatic relations still go south once you get to a certain size - and someone is bound to attack you if you dont so maintaining a strong army is essential and can make it harder to seek other victory types but it isnt a game breaker. im having ridiculous fun after 100 hours and ive barely scratched the surface.",212.6
"after a long series of backstabbings, had the pleasure of dancing on gandhis corpse. vishnu/10",88.4
"i recommend this game for those that like the turn based stratedy types. civ 5 gives you the right ammount of control over your civilisation without information overload. a well contructed game.",382.3
"i no longer have life all that is left is civilazation",116.9
"this is a awesome game it takes me back to the times i was playing command and conqure for the ps1 and ps2 it truly is a amazine game i recomend you buying it. it is very cheap for what you get and i almost forgot its on pc so you can easly mod it there are also some great mods out there one of my best mods are the world war 2 remake mods it is a fantastic mod and you can choose to be any country form britain, france, germany,usa,ussr it is a classic mod and i hope the guy or girl makes another! this is my post on this game thanks for reading! btw check out my youtube channel i am starting to make some videos on this game i just need to find the right capture software!",14.1
"if you have any experience with civilization games previously, do yourself a favor and buy the complete version of this that includes gods and kings and brave new world. the dlc for this game takes what was otherwise an okay, but kind of pared down and boring version of civ, and turns it into the best civ game since alpha centauri. other things of note if you are an older civ player looking at this game: - units are restricted to (basically) one unit per tile. at first this seems terrible, but in the long run youll wonder why you ever put up with stacks of doom. - instead of squares, you have hexes. this increases the strategic depth of the game a lot. - india will still nuke the hell out of you the first chance they get.",429.9
"great turn-based strategy game.everything is well made i like the mulitplayer that you can save the proggres that you have acomplished with the players that you are playing with.everything is well polished.",33.0
"i enjoy this game a great deal. a little tricky to start with but well worth it.",11.6
"obviously a classic series that continues to improve with every release, but be warned: the ai is inherently bad and does not play better on higher difficulty settings. instead, the game simply assigns better starting resources and disposition to the computer opponents, making the game incredibly unfair in the beginning, only to level out and eventually fall in your favour towards the end. when i discovered this fact, i was compelled to stopplaying, but i still dont regret the nearly 400 hours i spent on it.",391.4
"if you have all the expansions and dlc for the game it wil not let you go so easely.. just one more turn!!!",103.9
"too many problems to list running this game. i7, p8 z78 pro gen 3 mobo, 16g corsair ram, 256g ssd and gt 560 ti. game wont launch at all ever since i bought the dlc. updated all drivers, verified game cache, uninstalled, re-installed, and did a rain dance for good measure. game is broken. has been uninstalled and im not going to bother trying to  with it again.",20.6
"a really fun game to play if you dont mind slow paced games that can take quite some time. the best part for me is that you can make your empire big and then crush your foes like small insects under a boot.",81.5
"this si the kind of game that only comes out once in a great while. the game itself stay asmzingly true to the civilizations it prtrays. if i were a world history teacher, i would force my students to buy this game.",305.9

"a truely amazing game. well thought out, and never tires to entertain.",298.2

"frustrating and exhilirating. it is, for better or worse, the epitome of just one more click.",577.3
"at first i was not a fan of civ 5 after coming from civ 4 but getting the gods and kings and brave new world really improved the game for me. i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.",470.2
"if you dont have this game, i feel bad for you son, i got 99 problems but ghandi aint one... however the zulus are at least 9 of them...",55.8
"10/10, utterly brilliant turn-based strategy, excellent purchase",279.1
"im conflicted with this game. its much easier to play multiplayer now with steam, but civ4 will always be my nostalgic favorite. cool new things (to c5): more in-package civs i like the hexagon grid as opposed to the squares city-states! a bit more stream-lined better graphics added in archeology, music, arts, and writting for culture policy trees pantheons and customizable religions things i miss (from c4): trading technologies trading maps (otherwise, whats the point?) the animated building of wonders upon completion using mods in multiplayer leonard nemoy baba yetu (song) founding multiple religions multiple units per-tile",227.9
"i should go to bed. hang on, one more turn...  its 3am. 10/10 would play again.",223.3
"i came to the civ game late. only started with iv, but have had so much fun. game lengths can vary based on settings and is great for one you want to knock out in an afternoon or if you want an epically long game that takes a couple weeks to get through. i can see how civ really has defined the tbs 4x genre and civ v is a really great release with the tweaks an addition they brought (hexagonal tiles, no army stacking, more political aspects to you strategy) and has really made a well rounded game that you can play anyway you want.",72.7
"i cant belive that i played it for 1000 hours! every game has needed various situation and tactics.",1028.4
"my favorite game to just relax with. even at higher difficulties i never really stress out with civ i just sit back and try to execute my strategies to the best of my ability and hope i dont spawn in a desert. dlc is well worth it since it adds so many new layers to an already complex game. multiplayer is a blast as well. always a good time to beat a friend to a wonder and listen to them rage over skype.",146.0
"ive always loved the civ games and this one is even better.",121.1
"manage your empire as you decide how you want to expand its influence throughout the world. be the first to send your helpless people to the infinite beyound, big mac the world into submission, or choose to do things the old-fashioned way, through brute force.",48.1

"this game sucked and it is highly unlikely you will play it for more than a day. i tried to and in the end, i felt that i pissed my time away.",24.9
"fun, easy to learn, and very addictive. needs more detail. oveall one of the best.",837.4
"really fun game. you should get it if you like stradegy games.",95.9
"this game is absolutely amazing! my favorite civ by far. while the base game can seem alittle underwhelming gods and kings makes it a civ classic and with brave new world it feels like the culmination of civ games! i cant wait to see whats in store for civ 6 as i have already been blown away with how great this game is!",162.3
"probably the best sid meier game yet. i would recommend this for anyone who like a plot line in their game, this has all kinds of technologies you can research plus alot more. i really enjoy this game.",66.9
"buy now i mean it i have never had so much fun in a game i stayed up late just to play it worth the price but get it form amazon as it better.",235.3
"a fantastic game for passing the time, and an even better game to join up with your friends, and kick some .",477.9
"truly a classic, normally a series would have shown signs of slowing down or stagnating in terms of content or quality but the civ series is still going strong.",404.3
"i think my hours played say enough about what i think of this great game.",992.5
"say goodbye to your life. amazing game (both for single anf multi) with only one (very important for me, as mod fan) disadvantage: you cannot use mods (which completely overhaul the game) in multiplayer.",551.4
"a modern masterpiece, with the replay value of a hot blonde.",581.2
"this is a very addictive game, there are so many options for the maps and the opponents and everything, there is technology, history, science, culture, strategy, warfare, tactics, and more all combined, i created a game with all 14 civilizations and i have spent 3 days on just that game, and it is still not finished, but i have a glorious empire soon to crush germany, then either the empire down on the bottom right or egypt. my idea is play with large continents, take over one of them completely and then fortify it and do what you wish from there.",102.5
"never trust japan. this game is amazing and i had trouble leaving the computer for so long only because of this game. the expansions completely changes up the game and so when you think youre done, you try g&ks or bnw and instantly the game feels fresh. truly and amazing games that is worth the 1000s of hours youll end up having put itno it.",116.8
"this game is fun when playing against humans. its terrible playing against ai. the npcs are way too predictable and non-threatening. if you build up your military quickly, you can overrun them every time. graphics are better than previous civs, but still just ok. ui and tutorials are good.",82.1
"i would love this game but it i get so far and it shuts down every time.",51.0
"this is an amazing game. you can easily spend hours on end playing and it has matches that can last easily over 20 hours. with varying difficulty levels, it allows both casual and hardcore gamers a tough experience. although, the game is a bit incomplete and unbalanced without the expansions, it is still a good base game. i strongly recommend getting brave new world and gods and kings along with the game. it adds so much more functionality and realism to it. ive sunk many hours into it and it is by far one of my favourite games of all time. with hours of replayability, you can entertain yourself forever with this game.",287.8
"the last civilization i played was civilization iii and after that i didnt expect, that i would buy another civilization, bcs the balancing was really bad, but in civ v the balancing is much more better!!! (in civ iii: enemies declared war, when you didnt gave them the atomic bomb in exchange for the wheel thechnology -.-) since it lasted a long time, when i played a civ before, i got into the game again really fast, bcs its really newbie-friendly. i really like the graphics of the cities on the map (tiny monuments :3), but the streets are horrible ^^ (maybe i upload a screenshot to show you, then you know, what i mean ^^)",57.2
"still flaming mad about spending 13 hours on a campaign just to have the huns convince everyone to attack me. it is a great (albeit time consuming) strategy game. im interested in trying the turn by turn play. 9/10",17.7
"this game is amazing, highly recommend buying it, one of the best games ive bought :d",148.7
"amazing a few minor issues but not enough to say no to the game. all in all great compared to the past versions. if you loved civilization in the past worth a buy. if you had a hard time with past civilizations this game has fixed a lot of issues why you may have no liked it. i give it a 4.5 out of 5",147.2
"ive been playing civilization since the begining and i got to say that 5 is my favorite. it wasnt at first but after the gk & bnw dlc the game has really developed into a unique empire builder. so if you got money to throw down on the original version plus the dlcs get it.",631.0

"my interest in the civilization series borders on the insane. civ 5 is the first iteration with enough differences between factions that i feel compelled to try different victory strategies and different civilizations. its that awesome.",290.3
"one of the nicest touches to the civ series is how authetic the music is per era. well done, as always.",19.0
"this is the best game i have ever played. this is a turn-based game with cities to control and keep happy, wars to plan and attack, and wars to defend. this game has so much action that it doesnt get boring.",138.5

"great strategy game that gets you to deeply appreciate the long history of civilizations around the world, master the diplomacy among the nations, and above all, train your leadership capabilities in surviving the competition of great nations. with the exception of lengthy macro-management of resources and upgrades, the game itself is more than just a pc game, but a living encyclopedia for people to learn history and interntional politics.",88.1
"one of the best games ive ever played, definitely the best strategy game. the learning curve isnt as high as games like total war, the interface is clear and the gameplay is a crisp and refreshing take on the classic series.",63.6
"the game is cool, the constant crashes are not. tired everything from updating graphics drivers to playing in windowed mode with dx9, nothing fixes it.",193.8
"civ 5 is a turn based stratergy game which is extremly enhacned by the mass amount of dlc. 10/10 no negatives. all positives. why you even reading this just buy it !!!",11.2

"one of the best strategy games of today, civilization v is a turn-based game where you must lead your people to victory, be it by commading multiple units from many ages and achieving world domination, researching the unknow building up techonolgies from the ancient age to the future age and unlocking the stars, increasing your influence with every other civilization by growing national culture or elect yourself to the world leader position through diplomacy. chose one of the many great leaders like julius ceasar, napoleon, queen elizabeth and more",120.3
"one of the best strategy game ive play. the game takes a long time to play but is still fun all the way through. i will be putting a lot of hours toward this game and could easily be come one of my most played games on steam. the fact that the game also now works on linux makes it even better.",75.0
"extremely addictive and easy to put multiple hours in on a single sitting. great game with single player and even better when playing with friends. the initial loading screen is my only complaint as it is quite long.",225.6
"i have played this game twice, which is why i have 11 hours of gameplay. gg sid meier.",12.2
"a bit easier to play than other civs but still a lot of fun. every games gives me awesome stories to play in my head.",175.5

"great leave me alone im in my own world for 5 hours type game... once you hit next turn you dont realize youve been playing for the next 100 turns lol... only gripe is if you play a huge map the game will begin to freeze once you approach the modern era & thats when all the real fun starts. still.. 5 stars from the strategy lover",903.0
"this game is a perfect blend of all different types of strategy. it is great to play with friends and ramdom people you happen to find. i would also recommend x-com enemy unknown.",226.3
"the first civ game ive ever played and it makes me wonder what i missed out on before! its an extremely addicting game that is relatively easy to pick up. at the same time, im always learning something new too. the dlcs add a lot of interesting concepts to the game and i would recommend them if you can get them at a good price. for the amount of time ive put in, this game and additional content is well worth the prices (especially since i got it during the steam summer sale!). just remember to look out the window, stand up and get back to the real world every now and then!",279.4
"just gonna win by taking my entire army to delhi. *whole army destroyed by nuke* just got nuked by ghandi. 12/10",295.3
"i used to love civ 5, especially after gods & kings and brave new world. however, now with games like age of wonders 3, and endless legend, i just dont find it fun any more. also, multiplayer is impossible with the overwhelming amount of desynchronization.",179.8
"if you like going outside and maintaining healthy relationships. this game is way too addicting for you.",252.3

"much better than civilization iv; much more thought was put into the mechanics of this game, and as a result, it really is much more fun to play. has about the same amount of content in play as civilization iv as well, perhaps besides the number of civilizations/leaders you can choose. it utilizes superior strategic concepts, hex-based tiles, and has a much stronger user interface. a strong contender for the best civilization yet.",96.7
"easily one of the best pc games out there, i highly recommend this game. even without the dlc, it is still fun to play.",310.1
"awesome game,well..worth playing..didnt think i would like it but ended up playing 316 hours :)",342.5
"pretty much perfect for what its meant to do, you can tell this is a polished game, i heard it was bad at launch, but those problems are gone now. everything from the unique units to the soundtrack says that these guys know how to make a turn based strategy. this game is one of those easy-to-learn, hard-to-master games. you can have a great time and compete with only the most basic of civ knowledge, but at the same time, even after playing for 100s of hours you could still discover new concepts that bring more depth, like swapping works of art, or managing specialists. i do recommend all the dlc, it adds so much, expensive i know but this game usually comes up every sale.",684.6
"attack one city, become hated by the world. kill everyone to change their minds. 8/10 great genocide simulator.",68.4

"really enjoying civ 5, after buying it for the summer sale. its quite different from previous games, but i still love it!",10.1
"the pros are (as always with the civ series) the accessibility, sense of progression, and subconsciously creating a narrative with each new game. the biggest flaw in civ 4 makes a return in civ 5...the ai. the ai simply isnt good enough at playing the game, so the challenge has to come from the player being statistically handicapped (or playing online). at least one other 4x game enjoys a big advantage when it comes to the ai.",333.6

"way better than risk. you need friends to play risk.",50.3
"my first game on steam, and by far, one of the best games i have played. when i first got this civ v i almost cried myself to sleep. i felt as if it was slow, a waste of money and at the time i was more intereted in rtss. after the rts craze ended, i stumbled across this game again. after 10 minutes of playing, i thought why did i ever say no. it is pretty obvious to see that this game was well planed out, nice animations and graphics, suits playing styles (diplomatic, economic, military, science and even cross styles have advantages.) and hud is very nice too. the menus are easy to navigate and ingame. multiplayer is its only downfall, tbs, what did i expect. enough said. this game is fun and a massive time consumer. if you have enough time on your hands, then this is deffinitly for you. 9/10",94.9
"the turn-based strategy game from where all the other turn-based strategy games got their ideas from. playing civ since version 1 and it keeps getting better and better. recomend it to all strategy fans.",281.4
"so many hours of my life wasted in the game... incredibly addicting, but not once could i last long enough to the end of a game. its a lot more fun starting out than it is late game imo.",225.5
"one of the best tbs games, but for the series fans it still needs quite a lot tuning. i am really happy that the series is going in the right direction with the new content.",292.0
"probably my second favorite game on the pc. makes you feel important.",356.3
"there are few games that make you feel as in control or powerful as civilization 5 does. it certainly does a fantastic job at what its meant to do and i would recommend this game to you if youre into strategy games and using your wits to best your opposition.",403.2
"i waited years to get this game because i didnt like the idea of a hex based combat system. that was a mistake; despite being tactically useful youll quickly forget the shapes are even there. dont make the same mistake as me, buy this great game. if its on sale, even better.",217.8
"i love this game, it is my go-to when i cannot decide what to play. the pace is as quick or as slow as you need it to be. you can play an intense round of world-domination, or you can go for a leisurely cultural victory inbetween errands and household chores. i wish i could say specifically what i like about this game, but it is a combination of little things that keep me coming back. i like the music, the way the ai rulers feel real, i like how i can easily play with my friends on steam. after a rough day, civ 5 gives me the chance to annihilate my enemies, in style.",439.7
"amazing game, would recommend to anyone wanting a fun single and multiplayer game. the skill level required is easily adjusted in the game menu, making this a game suitable for anybody and everybody. ;p",38.5

"variety of expansions and civs to choose from keep this game fresh and very re-playable.",691.7
"civilization is already one of the best strategy games, but take its expanding dlc and it becomes one of the deepest games you could spend your money on.",38.8
"the grandest strategy title ever made. from the production values to the strategy, every aspect has been gone over til it fits and is fun. however, the ai isnt perfect, and other things can annoy you, but only after youve eagerly put in 100 hours. if you like strategy, you should own this game.",390.3
"hell of a timesuck-hell of a earth youll create in your wake.",91.6
"im playing this using my laptop with only the intel hd 4000 so i always play with all the animations turned off. in fact, i always play only using the hexagonal grid map yet i still hours and hours and hours of fun. this game is really that good and this comes from a guy who mainly prefers (action-, j- or just normal) rpgs. the last time i played and enjoyed an rts was aoe ii, waaaay back then. if i could only mention one or two things that absorb me in is the background music, especially when were talking about the middle eastern and the east & south-east asian themes. i love em! not only the music though, the tech tree, policy, units, buildings... there are tons of things that you have to decide, more importantly in the first 100/200 turns, and that what makes this games replayability is unmatched. seeing that this is the only game which ive clocked in for 80+ hours, id rate it 10/10",86.1
"i recommend this game, sadly when i was in sweden... the pirated version is a lot quicker on fixing bugs than the company. i bought two of these games because they did not accept donations and are probably mad that sweden allows pirating.",155.2
"arrgghh... this game and sleep do not combine. hellishly addictive !",121.9
"this is a must have for any kind of strategy player. hundreds of hours of potential game play. easily a 10/10, a gem of a game.",85.5
"amzing game, good art and graphics, immersive gameplay, well thought through multiplayer and it makes you use your tiny brains ;)",87.3
"its a great strategy based game. pefect for fans of fire emblem and chess, it offers alot more than just startegic combat. within, it gives insight into economoy and money and the beliefs of the people. these things all influence each other and give the player more things to think about beyond war.",44.9
"takes a few steps back compared to civ iv, but still an excellent game. word of advice: get the goty edition and avoid paying for $45 worth of dlc.",284.7
"if you want to conquer the world, this is your game",39.6
"this is the ultimate turn based strategy game. i love building up each civilization watching the citys grow and the farms spread. the city states is an intresting new addition which spices up the maps and can be removed if you so wish. i have been playing over lan with my friend and i will say, even on a small map with the slightly faster settings, a game can still take hours! (hours well spent!) just dont expect a quick fix. really good feature is the ability to save multiplayer games and resume with all players. drens view: buy this game!",44.3
"i absolutely love the civ games and the latest version does not disappoint!",133.4
"there is no reason why this game shouldnt be in everyones library! this is possibly the most addiciting strategy game ive ever stumbled upon! totally worth paying for! its that perfect blend of military strategy and simulation game. youll be on here for god knows how long when you should be studying for that electronics exam (thats me) buy it!! with the dlcs!",185.1
"one of the most addicting games ive ever played. massive in scale and depth, the game immerses you and makes you want just one more turn every time. turn-based strategy and (optional) very long games prove a challenging and very fun element, if not for everyone, due to its turn-based nature and depth. the ability to save and quit or just walk away and come back to the game at any time is a huge plus for me too.",408.0
"friend got me this, and got me into this, and i like this! :) this is fun.",170.1
"one of the best games ive ever played! great replayability",210.8
"dont be turned off by the fact that this is a turn based game. that was a mistake i made allot of times but now ill never make that same mistake again. i havent played any of the predecessors so it might or not be the best in the series but as a newcomer to civilization this game blew my mind! most definitely a must have!",76.6
"great fun at some points and a tad dry in others. best at sapping away at your day without you even noticing, especially since a standard match tends to last around 15-20 (or more) hours.",85.5
"dont buy this game. it will eat your soul and take over your life. 0/10.... now if youll excuse me its my turn again",184.6
"a relaxing, immensely stimulating, and imaginative game. i recommend it more highly than anything else i own; wtih 274 hours currently on record, it is by far the game ive played the most. managing empires with the highly varied gameplay of random maps to explore and different alliances to make ensures that, at least for me, it never gets old. difficulty ranges widely as well. its the kind of game that can be played anywhere and is fun to show people. playing with friends is a blast, as you ally and compete on the global stage. if i could pick one game to play for the rest of my life, it would be civ 5.",289.0
"great game, ive put so many hours of fun into this. great single player experience and even better when you do multiplayer with friends.",66.7
"this is my favorite turn-based game. i have been looking for alternatives, but none seem to have the same feel, or are too complicated for my simple needs. if you like a nice easy flowing game, this is it.",278.7
"holy crap. please dont start this game during the time of finals/diplomas/exams. you will get hooked, dont even think you wont, you will, i promise on my first born settler.",42.1
"my advice is to just go for the full game with all of the add ons. adds pretty nifty features to the game and makes it more complete. although to me, i think that they purposely gave us half the game and left the rest as add ons for us to pay more money. meh.",17.8
"this is an awesome game...and i dont do strategy! i must have put in over 20 hours so far, and im only just scratching the surface. ill report back when i know what the heck im doing, but so far love it.",38.8
"8/10 a good game. this game is not the best when it comes to civilization. it is harder to mod, and got rid of some factions. now, they did add some (like persia) but those dont make up for it. the goals are the same as every other and not many things have changed. unless if you want the multiplayer with more people do not get this at full price. get it when it is on sale. or, if you have civilazation 4 just stay with that. i like this game, but get it on a sale.",5.3
"i have been playing civilization ever since the first game came out. the latest version has some nice features. however, i would like to see civilization vi incorporate some of the features of civ iv and v together. the graphics and the cultural boarders expanding one area at a time is nice. also the hexagon layout is reminiscent of the old military strategy games. the features i would bring back would be the ability to stack units: even if the terrain would dictate how many could stack. otherwise you may spend more time shuffling units around than actually using the units. the second thing i would bring back is the ability to install and play the game offline. i dont know what kind of kickback steam gave the civilization designers, but i miss having a game that is free of this annoying and useless system.",64.7
"very good. recommend to buy all the expasion packs althought",181.4
"warning! please read! this game will suck the life out of you. the concept called taking a break will not work for this game. see how many hours i have on it? those are straight hours without any breaks. all night, no rest, just food. be warned. this game is amazing, and highly fun, and extremely addictive. you cant just play this game for a bit. you cant even just play this game for a while. you can only play it till your spirit is worn out, when your eyes are bloodshot, and when every single part of your  is cramped up. and only then, after you have met the criteria, can you take a break. this game is my jam. but i dont dare play it again, scared that i might die from complete exhaustion. score: 9 1/2 dead sleepless bodies out of 10 dead sleepless bodies. i like pangaea.",13.6
"dunno if, like me, youve played many of the previous incarnations of civilization before. they all follow the similar sorta premise. for me, each one seems to have a slightly different tilt than the last one, so, until you get used to it, it always seems slightly worse than the previous edition. i gotta say though, that this one seems to be (once, as i said, you get used to it) an even more well-rounded game, offering several different avenues for victory (although the domination type is likely all that most people aspire towards). the one downside id say is that it eats away at my day all too easily. you can never just sit down for a few minutes with it, and even when you plan to do that you end up looking at the time several hours later. either way, definitely a game worth playing assuming you can invest time in it.",187.0
"best turn-based strategy game ive ever played! and i recommend it.",228.8
"this is a very good strategic game. it is a lot of fun, very visually appealing, has a ton of options for how to build your civilizations, and is not too difficult to get the hang of. it does have some issues though. games take a long time. this can be mitigated somewhat by changing settings, but even so this is not a quick pick up and play game. sometimes that is what i like but not always. in addition although there exist ways to win the game without domination over the enemy civilizations, none of those options feel very interesting or satisfying. there are some other minor things here and there i dont like or feel i could like more, but generally this is a very solid game. 7/10",103.6
"the game is so funny. if i was in that game i will be happy :)",51.9
"its a good, fun strategy game, but it can be a bit buggy, and requires and pretty good pc.",3.3
"this game is fantastic! ever since brave new world, winning is much more difficult. there are many factors to balance in order to win, but not so many that it makes the game overly combursome. i love the wide range of civilizations you can play as and against. i highly recomend this game to anyone!",194.8
"even for turn based n00bs like me, who are used to rts strategy, its pretty epic. recommend highly.",7.4
"despite being a little crashy, this game is the best civ ive played. as george washington, i kicked genghis khans  with sun tzu leading my tanks. which gave me enough time to complete my cultural victory. :)",235.7
"civ 5 is complex with a healthy does of options however it remains balanced with very simple mechanics. easy to pick up and play with enough depth to keep you coming back. it may seem off putting if you have played civ in the past but this is a different beast, great with freinds or alone.",205.8
"very good game requires some stratigic thinking unlike some other games, has a lot of depth, will even the slightesting causing trouble with another civ, also plenty of different civs with onw strengths and weaknesses",86.0

"civ v is relatively easy to get into, yet there is almost no end to what you can do in it. to be honest, i bought this game right when it came out because i somehow had it confused with simcity. i would definitely recommend this game.",643.1
"fecking awful game, sid meier needs to burn for his crimes! possible side effects during/after playing: insomnia, headaches, carpal tunnel, high blood pressure, switching to the dark side, inabillty to socially interact, swearing at people dead hundreds of years.",695.9
"great game! until the b-hole barbarians show up to raze your city. but other than that a lot of fun.",65.2

"complex, addictive, fun. dont trust anybody, especially gandhi",211.3

"like risk meets settlers of catan but on an epic scale. this game is pretty incredible, but will suck every hour out of your day! at 3:23pm im investing in farmland technology, next thing i know its midnight and im telling myself ill be going to sleep just after one.. more.. turn",40.4
"amazing game. need all the dlcs to appreciate the complexity of this game. with all the added things it makes you feel like you are actually in control. worth getting if you have patience and are willing to use a better part of a day! i would give it a 8.5 out of 10.",82.4

"lots of fun choosing real world countries and ruling the world",104.0

"this is one jewel of a game. this has to be the greatest kingdom managing sim out there, if you get the expansion packs then it is the best. i wish it had most of the expansion pack fetures at start, and that kinda feels like a money grab. but the money is worth it.",30.0

"its a good game,a little slow when starting a game, but speeds up as you go along.",188.3
"play this game if you like lengthy and in depth strategy style game play. although the game has various speed settings, often times the longer the setting the easier the gameplay becomes when versed with aggressive computer ai.",154.3
"civilization isnt a game so much as it is a hobby, but if you are into turn-based strategy, civ v is some of the best. ive been playing this series for years and i am still learning things about improving my game. ...just dont buy this one if you like sleeping. civilization and sleeping are not compatible.",460.2

"i havent played the game as much some other people that have played this game. but i have to say, this game is a game with a lot of depth and attention to detail. i havent played a game that kept me up as late as it has before. if you like sleeping at night, you might want to reconsider buying this game. however, if you want a solid turn based, diplomacy strategy game, i would definitely give this game a whirl.",27.8
"this game is an epic time sink. first day i got it one more turn quickly turned into watching the dawn rise. must get for strategy lovers.",342.5
"i recommend civilization 5 for the players who arent able to quite play squad based games like coh2, and want an easier path than the total war series. its more relaxing, simpler. i have alot of hours on the game and i do find it can be difficult, but it is also a very calming game when you are experiencing the rage of failing other games due to cheese. multiplayer with friends is fantastic, would highly recommend to buy this and play with friends.",394.2

"this is the greatest turn based strategy franchise of all time. civilization 5 will suck your life away as, let me just do one more thing, becomes a day of gaming. the unit balance of this game is extraordinary, and the random world creation keeps the map/environment fresh and new every game. there is a large number of leaders to pick from each with their own abilities and special units/buildings that can allow for different strategic options even given similar set ups or in game technology/policy under a different leader. raging barbarians ftw!!!",453.6
"with the addition of the brave new world expansion, this is easily my favourite civilization game. the graphics are beautiful, gameplay deep, and the units and civilizations plentiful. if youre a fan of civ you should get this now!",55.3

"sid meiers civilization v is probably my most beloved game, and deserves all the praise it is getting. when playing the turn-based strategy game i found that i could play for hours on end, letting my civilization grow and my army conquer. i loved playing the single player of civ v, however i found that i enjoyed the multiplayer muc more. online multiplayer with my friends was probably the most enjoyable part of this game for me, we ran around, conquered empires and razed hell... however the multiplayer with strangers is a different story. you will find that these people either kick you, never join, attack to quickly or just leave, and even when you do find a game they are probably playing on a dlc you dont have. overall however, its awesome! rating = 9.5/10 great!",157.8
"i love this game!!! although as it goes onto the loading screen it crashes... it didnt do this before but it may be because i have windows 8 but i hope the creators can fix this...",10.5

"one of the best if not the best turn based strategy game around. you never get bored of it.",118.3
"great game. all a civ game should be. great graphics, lots of civilizations to play, lots of different paths to go. if something could be better, it would be the ai and the difficult level. the ai of the normal dificult level isnt very smart, and in the next level it is too strong, not because it became smarter, but because the game gives it too much advantage. all in all, it is a great game, a should play one.",153.9
"a great game, great strategy. if you desire to be the ruler of the world via conquest or diplomacy. wish to form a more cultured world or to simply leave your enemies on earth while you travel to a distant star. this is the game to play.",242.2
"really addictive and deep, one of the best strategy games out there today. recommend buying on sale with all dlc packs.",219.0
"its a really good game most people dont like it because they only play the 1st 100bc years so really they dont play but its a really good game so i hope you comment this and buy the game :d",176.4

"fun but takes a long time to play a whole game. better to take breaks and pick it back up at a later time.",131.9
"its frighteningly deep and well-conceived, but at the same time its easy to learn and an absolute joy to play. color me impressed.",218.2
"spend hours doing nothing but it is one of the best games ive ever played. 10/10 would waste life on",704.9
"for those who have never played civ before the interface is streamlined and gameplay tightened and this is a great game to start with. for those that have played this will be a refreashing experience in that this is unlike any game before it. you may find it lacking in research and civics areas but it is just different. i know different is scary but it is worth it for the new and improved, more tactical, combat where the grid is now hexes, cities must be sieged, and only 1 combat unit per tile. (no more stupid large stacks of units) give it a shot! i highly recommend it!",335.2
"the game overall is fantastic! but does need a good pc to actually play without lag. but overall 5/5 on gameplay and enjoyment! cant wait for civ 6",320.5
"super awesome game! make sure you have plenty of time!",150.1
"its not my normal go to game but i do find some level of fun in it. if youre looking to rule the world this is a good place to start. i think thats why i enjoy it at least. all and all not a bad game you could do worse.",48.5
"ever wanted to rule an empire? ever wanted to burn one? have you ever simply wanted to know what would happen if a massive ancient empire faught a small one wiht a nuke? civ will answer all these questions and more, and although i personally believe its slightly light on the diplomatic side of rulling an empire (sadly dont expect to hiring any assassins) the biggest draw is by far the history for me. any fan of history will love this game, and remember, a great empire, just like a great cake, is easily diminished at the edges (benjamin franklin)",44.3
"this is the best game i have played in the last few years. the expansions make the game even better. it still does have some problems with the ai and combat.",190.9
"never start this game if you have somewhere to be in the next 12 hours :)",347.0
"got this from sid meier humble bundle. not a big fan of world builders, but unexpectedly had an extreme amount of fun playing it. you should get it if you get the chance because you will spend massive amounts of time playing it.",64.2
"this game is by far my favorite civ as i had never played civ 4. the game is kinda dissapointing without brave new world as it improves the end game of civ. i also recommend to all those who get this game to look at the community workshop because there are some mods that are a must get for civ to improve the overall quality of the game. look at the amount of hours ive played. i would never have played a game that much if i hated it.",746.2
"great game, excellent starter rts for anyone who has played one previously. beware takes several hours to complete one game",24.1
"dont play this  with youngvaoelrd or whatevers hes gay and will play as such i hate my life this game sucks john always beats me too so dont play with him jesus its terrible but cool people play it so i open it and leave it on when i sleep to look cool ok",199.8
"my recommendation lies on the caveat that you have at least the gods and kings expansion. while civ 5 never quite reaches the heights that civ 4 + beyond the sword achieved, its still a title that can easily find itself draining dozens of hours from your life as you micromanage a burgeoning empire.",120.4
"this game is awesome hours and hours of great entertainment this is one of the best purchases of my life",130.0
"this game is one of, if not the greatest, strategy game that i have ever played. i highly recomend this game to all strategy game enthuisiasts, if you think you can handle it.",143.9
"this game captures the tediousness of politics and the thrill and pressure of war. i would reccomend this game to anyone clever and tactful enough to succeed in it.",10.3
"this game is supa awesome and i have spen tway too much time playing it... so its good :3",332.0
"not as good as civ 4 but still great in its on right",39.0
"this game is really fun, though i havent played very much. but for all those out there this game takes a really long time to play so i would suggest you make some time to play this game. i got this game about 4 days ago and ive already spent about 30 hours playing this game but all those hours were well spent creating the perfect civilizations.",35.7
"i just got this game from the humble bundle, if you like tbs games this is the most amazing game ever. i would recommend this game 10/10 to anyone who is looking for a game that you can invest time in and feel as though there is a payback. there are a ton of strategies that you can take when going about this game and i dont think that it will get old.",130.4
"fun and great mental challenge on higher difficulties",80.3
"the civilization series is a classic, civ v is no exception! it is incredibly addictive and because of its myriad of ways to play it is incredibly replayable. 10/10 would play again.",82.5
"wow, takes be back to playing original civilization i and ii with a good friend in middle school. awesome depth and gameplay mechanic. my only gripe is the lack of an undo of any last command given to a unit.",2.0
"i love civ! definitly worth buying however multiplayer games dont get finished often because this game can suck away hours of your life and not everyone in the game wants to spend 8 consecutive hours playing. so if you find yourself with an extra 8hrs of nothing pop a squat :)",430.0
"this is an extrememly addictive game which will take hours of your time, the single player and dlc hosts hours of play time and plenty of replayability, whilst the game does cater towards a millitary victory and the randomers in multiplayer drop out before the end of the game, it still isnt enough to stop you from buying the game 9/10",278.4
"great fun if you have a group to play with over a voip. even without that, a solid singleplayer kicks",134.9
"it seems like every time i play a game of civ v or watch someone else play a game, it comes up with its own interesting, emergent storyline. whats going to happen this time? does gandhi beat queen elizabeth in a naval battle off her coast? does president washington, after eras of wresting control of north america from the other natives finally go east in search of the fabled new lands known as europe? who would win if genghis khan were to fight shaka of the zulu? these are some of the amazing stories you will get to see and be a part of in this game.",141.5
"i find only the beggining of every civ game to be interesting, the rest is pretty much always the same and can get boring. the game really needs all the dlc to shine and mods can make it much more fun. i do recommend the game.",66.8
"hours of intense and strategic fun. if you dont have this then you dont deserve to have a steam account.",58.8
"build your nation, research technology, create wonders, evolve your cities, befriend city-states or bully them, create your own religion and spread it to other civs,destroy your enemies with catapults, cannons and tanks or erase them from the map with nukes. become the greatest nation ever.",227.6

"nice turned based strategy game. something i can play with the kids running around and not scar them for life.",32.7
"civilization has to be the best series of strategy games ever made. the two newest versions, civilization v and civilization v brave new world have brilliant graphics and textures. civilization v will honestly give you hours upon hours of fun, ive had 200+ hours! seriously recommend it:)",389.7
"now with gods and kings, the game has struck a great balance with level of complexity. why others miss the civ 4 stacks of doom is beyond me.",556.2

"one of the best empire buidling strategy games ive ever played. also has great content on the workshop. good job firaxis and sid meier.",32.6
"easily one of the best strategy games of all time.",20.7
"this is the first civilization i played. previously, i thought it was just a boring turn based game. boy i was wrong. its like playing chess on a hexagonal map with lots of different units. in this game you can really win (or lose) because of your strategy. the first turns are quick, but as you approach the end of the game you have to consider lots of things, be careful and think ahead. excellent game. i dont have many dlcs and im ok without them. they may add some interesting variations, but you can totally play it without them!",49.4
"i first played civ 3 and this one enhanced the gameplay. to win was the same but tech was more.",65.7

"simply in my humble opinion which is based on my long story of my life playing strategy turn based games since i am 5 years old boy, now i am grow up man and i still love play turn based games and my opinion reflects just the civ 5 isnt based on my previous experience with other civ games, so this opinion is just about this game and not about any other, i hope when someone read my fabulous opinion will certain be inclined to buy this game but remember my honest opinion is based on my 280 hours of civ5 experience so i believe its and expert opinion, this game is cool.",174.7
"when civ 5 first came out it was crap. when gods and kings came out, it became playable. when brave new world came out, they got it right. (especially the multiplayer which was so lacking earlier.) i would highly recommend buying all three pieces together or ignoring the game entirely.",812.3
"in a game where ghandi can conquer the aztecs with giant death robots, anything is possible.",569.6
"an absolute must have for those new to the turn-based strategy genre. a game that is easy to pick up, but hard to master, civilization vs new hexagonal tile system allows for greater strategic depth in the field of combat. there are a plethora of civilizations to play as, from the ancient mayans to the modern americas, and a wide range in between. theres one to fit anyones play style and preference. by the way, if you want every civilization you will need the following dlc: gods and kings brave new world babylon civ & scenerio packs: -polynesia -denmark -korea have fun and good luck!",180.4
"another creat tittle in the civ series. fans of strategy need to get this game. plus all the user created mods really add more replay value. i mean who wouldnt want to be their favorite character from mass effect? a must by for the thinkers",139.8

"a great strategy game that you find yourself playing for hours on end.",78.4
"if you like board games, then you might like this...",7.0
"the best civ game if you have the two major expansion packs. its best if you buy a deal that includes everything. great user interface, and much easier to play than the previous titles. it is comfortable to play the game with the mouse alone, so you can lean back and dont have to stay in reach of the keyboard. some bugs, and an ai that is lying to you, which sounds cool but really is annoying as decisions of the other civilizations seem random at times. there are good mods, although it appears some of the civ 4 mods are not yet reached in quality/impact on the game.",116.2
"great game but it is such a shame that the gold dlc pack was removed from the store. now i am stuck with the basic version unless i want to drop another $100.",86.3

"is this game good? well i wouldnt say good... i would say it is awesome!!! seriosly, if you like turn based strategy games this is the game for you. it has everything you would want. so come on buy it and jump in a game! it will use up all your day for a single game sesion. xd",58.8
"i have mixed feelings baout his game. i like civ4 better but i like the hexacon map and clouds on civ5. also the multiplayer on civ4 is wayyyy better. if youre new to civ5 and/or want to play send a request.",334.0
"picked this up during the holiday sales because ive never played a civ game. im really glad i did. its deep, well made, and highly addicting. the game modes are different enough to keep me very busy for a long time. my only complaint is the price of the expansions. i got civ 5 for 9.99 and it comes with a single scenario (rise of the mongols) - for other expansion packs id have to pay 29.99 (brave new world, gods + kings) each. i cant justify paying 3x for the expansions, which is too bad, since id really like to explore additional scenarios and especially the religion mechanic. that aside, i dont need the expansions, and civ 5 was a truly great find for me. absolutely recommend the game and hope that the expansions or gold version come down in price before too long.",181.1

"for those who played civ2 for the whole life and now trying civ5 - dont build the same amount of roads/mines and farmlands. now they cost. a lot.",41.1
"what can i say about civ 5? it is the greatest strategy game ever made thus far, and i doubt that will change until civ 6. sid meir is single handedly dragging the stratagy genre through a time when strategy games are about as popular g.w bush. there is no reason to have steam and not own this game. it is the greatest concept ever conseived by a games designer. now put down your tools workers and worship at the feet of or lord, sid meir. 10/10",46.9
"this game is very interesting. i have only won 2-3 games so far in 80+ hours of game play. i keep coming back to the game and doing more with it. i suggest this game for everyone!!.",108.7
"this game is absolutly fantastic. you can lose hours just getting halfway through a single game. no matter how you want to play through a game, whether you want to attack other countries, make peace, build sceince (my personal favorite as everything is easier if you have better sceince then other people), build culture, spread a religion, build cities, etc. and all thoose and more are ways you can win a game too! the ai could be a bit better but i hear the brave new world expansion fixes that (i want it sooooooo badly). so to sum all that up: play this game",26.7
"probably the most addictive game i have ever played. you keep thinking that next turn will be your last, but no! you just cant stop. very fun that your leader can live from 2000 b.c until the future which is about 4000-5000 years. also funny is that you can choose different religions to your city. for example- christianity in arabia and so on. 9/10 - cons: slow multiplayer players pros: probably everything",101.1

"lost hours of my life to this game in a matter of 2 weeks.",300.4
"this game is probably the best strategy game i have played in quite some time. best advice is to not let time get the best of you cause it will slip away quickly. civilization v requires lots of patience and to think on every early and late game move you make . i strongly recommend this if you are veteran strategist or new to the genre.",146.4
"i used to make fun of people who played this game. but- i was wrong. it is pretty much the best game ever.",138.4
"specific historical accuracy aside, civ gives you a quick look at all of human history. a very addicting game, dont be suprised when you look at the clock and realize that a couple of hours have passed.",90.6
"great game, incredible improvement from previous versions.",77.7
"great game overall. takes some time to get to know how to do everything, but it is worth it. once you have learned you will be hooked.",94.7
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i know. you can play it over and over again, and its fun every time. i strongly recommend this game and all of its dlc to anyone who wants a good challenge and also, if anyone has the chance, burn that traitorous  ghandi for me.",70.0

"this game has the best replay value of any game ive ever played.",830.0
"what cant i recommend? this game will eat up your hours, turning day to night. its indepth game play and full on strategy can take you away leaving you wide eyed thinking what the hell happened to you life. note: i am only mentioning this if you really are into strategy and mostly games similar to civ v. the addition of ranged bombardment i think is awesome, it just allows players to fire weapons from behind the front lines, you also have fully animated leaders interacting with players from a screen-filling diplomatic scene which i guess is not too bad, kinda just adds a bit of spice to it. if you have friends, group or a party to play with then this is definitely a bonus.",146.0
"best game ive played in 10 years! extremely addictive. beware, you will have no life after you play this!!",169.0
"this is a great game that i would recommend to evryone and anyone who likes anything to do with strategy, war and utter domination. i guess thats most people. well done firaxis, this game truly deserves all of the recognition it has received. it is an absolute masterpiece if you dont mind losing a bit of historical accuracy and is great for casual and hardcore gamers that dont mind sitting at their pc for 10 hours straight. hats off to firaxis once again.",72.5

"if you like being part of a country that is inadequate in becoming a world superpower, i would recommend this. if you feel adequate and are able to win this game in online multiplayer, then you sir, are a .",18.8
"excellent game with almost unlimited replayability.",170.7
"as a gamer who played the original civilization in the early 90s, it has been interesting to see this franchise evolve. after civ ii and iii which were not that good, iv came out with a smash reinventing the turn-based strategy game genre. now we are at civ v, and i cannot recommend this game enough. currently pushing 1.000 hours, and the expansions just makes the game better and better. if you do not already own it, buy it, play it and love it!",1027.8
"i dont know if you know this but im giving this game a good review show you should feel good.",160.4
"just a fantastic game. really is fun to play, even more so with firiends. it is a game that even though you know does not change, even if you leave it a month, you have to have just one more move on. cannot leave my people in peril, i love them too much. so addictive that i suggest you set an alarm on your phone as this will eat away the hours.",42.9
"this game is another mind-blowing game among the franchise.",67.5
"i tried freeciv when i started using linux years ago and it mad me hate turn based strategy games but this game is just epic. and it also works fine in wine",65.7
"boss game! a must have especially with both dlcs! if you guys get it tell me i wanna show you my true stratigical power",134.1
"this game is the bees nees especially love how the promote modding definite plus.",728.5
"outstanding game, it essentially goes to the begginning of human civilizations and you can deal with problems the way you want to. some mods are cool, some break the game. dlc are great as well and they dont break the game. in all, epic game.",398.9
"i have 69 hours on record. thats just the best thing in the world.",247.2
"and it was there george washington led the americans from 2000 bc to 3000 ad. he met many characters such as the man, ghandi, know for his peaceful protests, yet somehow, even after keeping their borders open and friendship constant, betrayed washington and then lost because washington had rockets, and rockets are awesome. by the way you cant play a quick game of civilization. ever.",42.0
"civ is a fantastic game. turn based stratergy and very in depth. it looks complicated but once you get the hang of it its all fun. good and bad situtations, things can go either way. the endings fell a bit short but the expansion pack brave new world fixed that awesome game 9.5/10",227.4
"two words  buy it! if you love strategy games this is the game for you. never a single dull moment. play how you want, and its brilliant when playing with friends go for it, if you love strategy game",30.3
"this is the most addictive games that i ever played i could barely eat and sleep even change the underwear because of this and the achievement is really tremendously huge and very challenged at the moment waiting for brave new world discount :p",149.6

"one of the best strategy games available vanilla version good but map packs improve it massively.",190.8
"this game is almost a s addictiong as drugs. great game.",97.6
"civ v is by far one of my favorite games and anyone with hours upon hours of free time should pikc it up!",61.5
"one of the best and hardest strategy games ive ever played, but the one downside to this amazing game is that it gets very redundant.",167.5
"civ v, why the v? what does it stand for? vengenace? victory? vicks?",167.3
"this game is really great. i was new to the civ series, but its easy to pick up and get into. everything is straightforward, but still challenging enough that you have to plan and strategize. even just against npcs its fun. in the brief time i played with a friend, we had a good bit of fun despite their poor connection.",55.5
"great game, but it has taken over my life! i just cant put it down.",86.3
"i didnt think i would like this since it was turn based, but i was wrong. highly addictive game.",134.5
"truly the best civ yet! balanced no matter how you play.",97.5
"great game. plenty of depth, strategy, history and war to keep you coming back for more. also a good game to play with friends.",176.8
"ive been playing civ since the first game came out years ago. this latest iteration is one of the best.",212.2
"awsome game fun if you like strategy games but if you get it i suggest brave new world because it adds a lot of things that felt like the game was very bady missing.",88.8
"great game. lots of fun. tones of strategy. make sure you set aside a couple of hours at a time to play this one. dlcs well worth it.",373.0
"this game is an amazing game to play with your buddies or by yourelf! highly recomended and not banned in china... yet",703.4
"holy time sink batman, this is one good game. never played much of the first 4, but i really am enjoying this one.",27.2
"definitly one of the best games ive ever played! a very extensive game, youll have a lot of fun playing it!",186.1
"i love this game. its amazing with the expansion packs too. i have played so much and cant wait to play more!",147.2
"civilization v is a fantastic game! i normally dont get excited or too interested in strategy games such as this, however civilization v captured my interest from the first time i discovered another civilization. a fantastic game and one that should not be missed.",20.7
"civilization v pares down a lot of the unnecessary elements and game mechanics that have been creeping into the series, bringing it down to a very polished set of basic mechanics.",103.9
"fantastic, watch the hours of your life wash away before your eyes as another classic civ sucks you in. even better with gods & kings.",289.7
"one of the only games for which i buy expansion packs with no resentment. civ is worth every $, and frantkly a lot more than that. workshop is amazing for this game, and has every mod you can think of. civ 5 improves gameplay significantly over civ 4. while some veterans have trouble adjusting, in the long run the changes are for the better. ai players remain competitive to the end, unlike old civs where one nation dominates to the finish. i only wish i could make the game go faster. no matter how much i overclock or upgrade my pc, a 16 player game on a huge map just starts to slow down near the end.",847.0
"a good enough successor to civ4. some things it does really well, like hexes. other things i miss from civ4, like its significantly harder to field an army, and enemy cities are significantly harder to attack now. if i outnumber him 5:1, i should just win. but no, one unit per hex, so not everyone gets to attack the same turn... makes combat slower. graphics are beautiful. no more leonard nemoy narrating. :(",386.5
"200+ hours of playtime cant be wrong. and there are so many ways to play this game.",244.5
"crazy fun with a few friends, and just generally a great play.",206.3
"requires a bit more careful planning, thought, diplomacy and time than other games ive played. bit of a time sink, but damn is it satisfying to one-up england with a people they suppressed and screwed around historically.",184.2
"136 hours in and still loving it. cant imagine it ever being boring.",397.5
"this is hands down the best turn-based strategy game i have ever played. as soon as i got into my first match, i knew this game was amazing. if you ever sit around and say if only i ruled the town/country/world things would be better! nows your chance to prove it by ruling your own town/country/world. will you be a ruthless tyrant, or a shrewd diplomat? will you destroy your neighbors, or peacefully coexist with them throughout the centuries? its your choice. thats what civ 5 is all about: you shaping your empire the way you want it.",149.3
"do you enjoy turn based strategies? do you want to lose days (im not ing kidding) worth of productivity as you scream out your anger at barbarians and ghandi? then this game is the game for you. everything you have probably heard about the game is true. there is a ton of gameplay and deep mechanics behind this game, and a plethora of gameplay difficulty choices to match your playstyle. i have spent countless of hours playing this game (and civ iv as well). definitely worth playing if you enjoy the genre! this game is not pc friendly, so be sure to have a decent gaming box in order to play it. 9.0/10.0",353.1
"civilization v is a very wel l made experience that will literally provides days of gameplay! with your friends, or running solo, the stories you create with this game are very well worth it.",50.7
"if i could only play one and only one game for a year, this would be it. you will lose all your time playing this.",605.3
"i bought this game because i wanted to be hitler and its like, how about otto von bismarck, instead, and im like, piss.",62.3
"awesome game, although very slow at some stages. it does take a long time to research some techs and create some units, not recommended if you just want a quick game and not wait 3 days to nuke the bloody egyptians",112.9
"step one: meet ghandi step two: ghandi drops a  of a-bombs for no reason step three: you drop a bunch of f-bombs at ghandis a-bombs step four: ing defeat. repeat steps one through 3.",70.6
"not as complex as civ iv, but that doesnt mean its been dumbed down to the point of being boring. the simplified interface and management allows it to be more accessible while still allowing for some interesting strategic options. the civilizations are fun to play and i found the simplified resource management allowed me more time to plan my civs out the way i wanted. the modding community is also very active and you can usually find a mod to tweak any settings you wish to fit your playstyle, all (or most) easily accessible from within the games built in mod interface. definately reccomend to tbs veterans and newcomers who may find the interface and mechanics a little more beginner friendly.",34.5
"good game. ive obviously spent a lot of time playing so a positive review shouldnt be surprising. an excellent addition to a classic 4x game. i would recommend getting the expansions, as they add a lot of depth to the game. lots of replayability, especially if you mess around with various map features.",585.3
"after months of patching away bugs this game has become really good",727.1
"sid meiers (why is his name all over this?) civilization v is honestly one of the most fun turn-based strategy games i have ever played. if you have any interest in ancient cultures, i would highly recommend picking the game up. although it may feel rather simple at first, the game has a surprising amount of depth to it, and the multidue of victory conditions make almost any playstyle viable, once they have been fine-tuned. civilization v is not fast-paced, wont get your blood racing, and likely wont satisfy the gamer looking for a hardcore experience. instead, civilization v serves as a nice relaxing game that gives you time to think, a relaxing escape to wind down after a long day of work. just dont start playing right before you have someplace to be, because you will get sucked in to playing just one more turn. before you know it, its 6 a.m. and you have to go back to work.",419.4
"sid meiers civilization v is a really nicely created turn based stratagy game. you will find your self playing the game for long 8+ hour periods as you expand your empire. i only have 200 hours on this game and i am sure i will get loads more. my only issue is that i would say the base game is somewhat lacking. its still a good game but could use more, so if you are intrested on getting the game i would reccomend the gold edition as it comes with some new civs and g&k wich is an amazing expansion. the other expansion bnw is also a fantasic addition to the game and recomend you pick it up also.",296.5
"great strategy game. control your country to achieve victory by any means necessary. war, science, diplomacy, etc. you decide!",515.1
"best turn-based 4x strategy game, even better with g&k and bnw",134.5
"while civ v has been the subject of much criticism from the series long-time fans, dont let their silly words of anger distract you. the civ formula remains intact in this latest game, and many of civ ivs clunky elements (i never liked religion and espionage) have been removed. additionally, wars are now much more fun and tactical to fight thanks to the one-unit-per-tile restriction despite some glaring (but still relatively minor) flaws introduced by the concept. the only things i can name as negatives are the rather stripped-down multiplayer (which i dont play anyway) and ridiculous dlc prices. just forget about these, buy it, then set an alarm clock because you *will* lose track of time.",171.7
"a game that fails to justify its very existence through sheer lack of innovation; and that doesnt say when that started. one of the most overrated games of the past several years.",71.7
"i heard the term time vampire used to describe this game and its highly appropriate. i end up playing 4 to 6 continious hours of this game on most days. this is bad for my sleep because i have a normal 10 to 6 job, its difficult to start getting into it at first with the huge amount of information presented to you when you start playing the game, but once you start understanding how the game works, you cant stop playing. i spent the most amount of money so far buying this game (gold edition+bnw) and i have no regrets. but i only recommend this game for people who have alot of time to spare, full five stars from me :)",167.8
"long-running franchise in turn-based awesomeness. do yourself a favor and get lost in this title for days, weeks, months, or like me, years. for some reason i have two accounts, each with a copy of this one.",202.4
"good game! never plaly this before going to bed. its way to addictive.",22.1
"after bismarck, montezuma, catherine, and ramses ii all decide to annihilate you in 2001 ad, you will know the meaning of pain.",27.1
"the latest in the civilization series, this game takes the experience to a whole new level. hexs replace squares, allowing cities to expand and grow even bigger then before. while features have been removed from civilization 4, others have been added that give the game a new sense of balance, and more planning than ever is required to create a civilization to stand the test of time! a true must for the budding world leader.",561.9
"its a time-killer, for sure, but if you can spare the time, its worth it. multiple interlocking systems mean theres always something to do and always decisions to make, but no given ele.ment is too complicated to understand; everything is both intuitive and extensively documented. whether youre interested in simple growth and exploration or military strategy and tactics, theres a successful strategy that matches your tastes and style. especially with the brave new world dlc, civ v offers essentially endless variation in what you can do, multiple paths to victory, and numerous ways to fine-tune the feel during setup or play. i like 4x games in general, but this is the first time since alpha centauri that one has grabbed me, and held on, this way.",440.3
"this game is an excellent addition to sid meiers collection of games. the original version is much simplier than the older systems and in a way easier for me to learn since this is my first civ game. however there are much more complicated tasks and different ways to win as the game progresses. the history in this game is quite accurate and interesting for those who love history and random facts. i highly recommend this game if you are a history nut and enjoy strategy games. also check out the expansions as well they add a lot of new features that ultimately change the gameplay and ways to win!",429.3
"brilliant game, cant stop playing siince i brought it and just love being able to play it with all my mates :d",155.8
"civilization 5 is probably one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time, i really enjoy the series even civilization revolution for the xbox 360. but overall i recommend this game to all 10.5/10",36.9
"i just started playing this game and i can already tell you this game is magnifigent, truely a work of art.",24.5
"this is one of my all time favorite games. it will keep you up til early next morning...",89.4
"although turn based strategy games are not everyones cup of tea, this critically aclaimed edition to the civilization franchise is a detailed and intracite game that once learned is extremely addicting. although it is pricey, once a steam sale rolls around it can be as much as 75% off. it is a must have for anyone looking for a new game to sink hundreds of hours into.",567.0
"this is a great game has some what oof a learning curve but other then that itys great",556.8
"excellent game. you end up spending a lot of time, but its very relaxing. the expansions make it much better.",40.0
"mah a mah a mah mothering a, yeah i recommend this . buy it or some crap like that, dont torrent #torrentsnot4me",55.4
"an absolutely fantastic game for anyone who enjoys strategy games!",67.9
"with all the expansions and dlc, this iteration is finally living up to the name civilization. although very different from earlier games in the series, it retains the depth, character, and addictiveness. my only disapointment is with the lack of completely game-changing mods that made civ iv into such a wide platform. overall, id recommend it with all expansions to any strategy gamer who hasnt already picked it up.",329.7
"started playing it a week ago. i have a total of 26 hours, and my wife is giving me worried looks, so i have to say that this game is awesome. so many strategies and things you have to take into consideration, that i feel like im only scratching the surface.",34.9
"premium title that is fun, civ is the standard for turn based strategy games.",1029.1
"i love this game. can spend hours on end playing it",348.4
"new to civ, and after buying gold and brave new world. i think this is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all time. very highly recomemded. but make sure to buy the dlc. just wiat until theres a sale and gold upgrade goes down to $5 then get that and bnw. then, youll be set for a lot of fun.",491.3
"great turn-based strategy game. highly recommended. very easy to sink many hours into.",54.6
"a really addicting turn-based strategy game on building and expanding your civilization. it offers hours and hours of fun giving you a rise of plans to conquer the world. this game willl keep you saying just one more turn.",79.5
"its like chess with more buttons, good timewaster, but almost too tedious as the games can be rather long or chase-worthy without a good partner and nemesie, can get strategically heated but moments are too far in between, still a good experience.",58.2
"the expansions were pricey but ultimately this is one of the most solid strategy games ive played, as well as one of the most immersive.",217.6
"i never used to like strategy games all too much, specifically turn based ones. i found them too boring to keep me interested. but i suppose my taste in games has matured a bit since i would have to say this game is pretty good. granted practically any decent game in which you rule an empire gets my approval by default, but this is genuinly a good game. i have no gripes in particular and nothing to point out that i find amazing, its just good. i wouldnt sugest you pay the $60+ for it though, wait for it to be on sale or find some other cheaper way to acquire it.",110.7
"i never learned how to tune a harp, or play upon a lute, but i know how to raise a small and obscure city into glory and greatness. the great questions of the day will not be settled with means of speaches and majority descisions, but by iron and blood.",274.6
"great game. is a refined experienced compared with older civs. the latest paths made it a little better, giving us back detailed statistics after the game. the hex-based map for combat was a needed upgrade that made it better. at the same time, you have new and better relatively peaceful options to pursue victory like diplomacy and culture.",194.2
"i know a lot of long time civ fans are torn between loving and hating civ 5. personally, i think its the best civ game ever made, i think its amazing piece of art and ive enjoyed every turn. thats not to say i completely agree with every change theyve made since civ 4. for example; one of the big changes is that you can no longer stack military units on hexes. this works wonderful for small, tactical battles and definitely makes it more interesting than piles of doom clashing, but on a large scale it tends to be absolutely tedious to move your units to be in range to actually do something, and makes it hard to retreat because your own units are blocking the way out. so i would recommend to stick to small scale tactical battles and youll enjoy it so much.",325.1
"all you civilization fans may have heard civ 5 decried due to its seemingly sharp departure from the regular civ formula, witht he one-unit-per-tile rule and the game being focused around that particular rule. take heart! the gods and kings expansion made some sweeping optimizations while adding religion and espionage to the game, and now it feels like a fantastic, top-of-the-line civilization game again. while the one-unit-per-tile rule still stands, the game feels more cohesive now, instead of feeling like its fighting your every strategy. civilization 5: gods and kings saps hours out of you as you become immersed. definitely worth every single penny.",136.3
"i bought the gold edition which includes gods and kings by default, so i wont know what the vanilla civ v is like. however, critiques have been saying that without the expansions, civ v is not that good. that said, i also have not purchased brave new world, the newest expansion for the game. theres nothing much to be said about a civ game. it is good looking as hell, especially with the graphics turned all the way up. also, i am not an avid civ player; never really a fan of this kind of grand strategy games; but civ v has enough humour and tounge-in-cheek moments for me to enjoy it. i played 15 hrs of civ, which is about 2 games, and enjoyed both thoroughly. if anything, get it if its on sale. totally worth it.",12.4
"the previous games of the civilization franchise are some of the better games available on pcs, and this latest iteration is no different. in concept, its no different from the previous four games but some new additions - including a significant revamping of the combat model - and excellent graphics make civ5 worth a look. but beware; it is as addictive as ever and every time i play i end up going for just one more turn into the wee hours of the morning.",62.1
"hated the hex grid at first, fell in love. only issue i had with this game is steam pricing issues, but now its cheap enough to not even hesitate to buy. buy it!",669.9
"if you have played civilatation iv dont buy this! it may have better graphics, but this game is just about the same thing as civilatation iv. i suggest going to its page and buying it!",12.3
"really good game, highly reccomend getting all the dlcs, and playing with some friends!",77.8
"you will spent your all time for playing this game.",10.3
"amazing game, you can get some really interesting things happening in it, backstabbing, trading all kinds of stuff, so if you do or even do not like strategy games, this is an amazing one to try out",34.8
"15.6 hours and i havent even finished the first game i played. an incredibly addicting game, if you dont own it, buy it. it should be a staple of every steam library.",23.5
"if you wanted to know what it was like for montezuma to come back from the dead and send giant death robots after you, then this is the game for you.",182.9
"great game. loads of content and loads of fun. 10/10",133.7
"dont play late at night unless sleep is unimportant. and never trust ghandi",112.1
"one more turn addiction, check. lots of nations and emergent storylines, check. send people to thier deaths in the name of religon, just like in real life, check. annoying advisors, check. unlimited replay value, check. should purchase, check.",134.2
"one of the better games ive played, great replay ability rate.",28.2
"great turn-based game, spent way too kuch time playing this! good for quick games or long marathons! :d",48.5
"this is one of the most addicting games that i have played. i have found myself starting to play and then looking at the clock after what felt like minutes and seeing that i had been playing for hours. it is the perfect game for anyone who loves strategy games and it plays out almost like a digital board game. my friends and i can not get enough of this game.",34.9
"sid meiers civilization has always been a game where you could sit down and play for countless hours. it never gets boring, as each time can be different. civ 5 upholds this expectation and adds to it with amazing dlcs. if you dont have it, its worth getting without a doubt.",32.8
"civilization v is sort of like a time machine.. you start playing friday night ---> you look up and its saturday morning.",141.2
"civilization 5 is awsome gamme for thos how like stretige.",268.8
"amazing game! well put together, and the graphics are great, especially on a desktop.",173.5
"this is civ5, a game where you conquer people and nuke stuff. at least according to me. for the uninformed, its a hexagon-grid turn-based strategy with a focus on combat, diplomacy, city management, and hurling nuclear weapons at people. no story here, folks, you make the story yourself. +good visuals. +stupid amount of mods. +map editor and modding tools. +scenarios are pretty cool. -ai is irrational in terms of diplomacy. -multiplayer exists, but its pretty bad. -no story except for what you make.",299.5
"find a free weekend and start playing civ. you will not regret it.",73.2
"one of the most awesome games i have ever played. and the dlcs are worth buying",170.5
"i love the entire civilization franchise; civ 5 is no different. its an amazing ton of fun to build your own empire. with the expansion packs of gods and king and brave new world (in addition to the other civs), the game becomes full - i highly recommend them as well. new to the game are city-states and a one unit per tile rule. this adds a great amount of strategy when thinking how to manage your military or dealing with other civilizations.",869.4
"if you like wasting hours of your life, and enjoying every moment of it.... buy this game. very fun long time startegy game.",481.8
"prepare to lose hours - possibly even days - of your life to this game. although fans of the civ iii interface might struggle to find civ v as intuitive, its still the same scramble for power and influence we love.",8.9
"amazing. played it for years. may have problems with crashing if your pc isnt very good (may seem obvious but this was more evident than with other games)",111.4
"civilization v is a drug addiction. 10/10 would get addicted to again.",462.5

"really fun game. you will always play one more turn....",91.9
"i absolutely loathe turn-based strategy games, but civ was a ton of fun for me. if youre afraid of the slowness, there are a lot of easy ways to turn up the speed. if youre not very much into strategy games, this game allows you to enjoy the strategy experience casually by giving you achievable yet challenging tasks. just make sure to turn the difficulty down a bit and the pacing up a bit. the tutorial and ui are very well-designed and are great for civ beginners. id recommend this over civ 4 unless youre into strategy games already...",41.0
"great fun by yourself or with friends! if you enjoy managing infrasture and war at the same time, then this is most likely a game for you",293.6
"prepare to not leave your computer for weeks at a time. instant classic.",1102.3
"very fun game. it mixes the fun of building a civilization and conquering the world together. it has different things you can do like go for the science victory. there are quite a few victorys and characters making the game interesting. it generates new maps so you will have a new experience every time. i would give this game a 9 out of 10. i highly recommend you buy this game.",238.6
"its civ. you just take a couple of . . . its civ. 92%",9.2

"i have spent more time on this game than probably any other game ive ever played. if you can get the gods and kings expansion with it, but it stands up on its own well enough to warrant a purchase.",674.5
"great game to play with others or even solo just watch out for just one more turn syndrome. that one more turn can cost you hours! go buy it and play it!",169.5
"a very addicting game. youll find yourself thinking just one more turn indeed... ...to the point of forgetting how much time passed. i found myself thinking this would have a very high learning curve, after hearing all the strategy needed to play a civilization game (this is the first in the civ series that ive played), but soon found out that its not so bad once you get the hang of the gameplay.",48.8
"great game but it will be nice if you get a new leader with units and a bonus everytime your first one reaches its death",309.6

"oh god please help me! ive clocked up over 600 hours and im still playing.",709.7
"awesome game!! great fun!! bonus: its a time machine!! start a game and you will be transported hours into the future! 6 out of 5 stars!!",21.5
"sid meier still get it, civ 5 is awesome ! with the first addon gods and kings it kicked civ4 from my favorite place of all civilization parts (played 1, net, 2, 3, 4 and 5). new tactics with a few changes like the hexagon fields on the map, only one military and only one civil unit on one field. great looking graphics and still one of the best gui i ever used in a strategie game. top !",524.2
"dangerously compelling. i usually find strategy games anticlimactic, but this is more satisfying than most.",190.3

"9.2 / 10 sid meiers civilization v i truely love this game and really cant hate but +amazing strategy game +good combat and movement effects +nice look to it / nice graphics - the leaders never change ex: russian leader catherine in 20th century -the friendship between different civs feels more of a job ex: they always mooch of you and you cant ask a favor back and when you dont give them charity they denouce you",150.9
"very different from civ iv, but equally as fun. took me a while before i knew what i was doing, but me an friends playing multiplayer is so much fun. the mods also add alot to the game that the game never did (i.e. stalin, fdr, hitler, middle earth, etc.)",78.3
"had sooo much fun playing this game. definately worth a shot for anyone whos never tried it",163.8
"best civilization so far. hex grid with one unit stack size makes it an entirely new game. main weak point is that the ai unfortunately doesnt seem to be sofisticated enough to make decent use of the tactical options provided by the new system. it is a solid game both with and without expansions.",113.6
"very good game excelent replay value, i bought gold edition and it has saved me a lot of money. 9/10- to slow to start off",158.9
"i played the singleplayer thru as ing hitler how ing cool is that yea you ing tell me",32.0
"spend 20 hours playing one game just to get nuked by ghandi, 11/10 must buy",244.7
"this is amazingly fun, and is a great improvement on the ivth intallment. its easy to understand if youve played the others and i know plenty of people that love it. 9/10",14.5
"probably the best game that i have on steam right now in my opinion. if you dont have it, definatly get it, you can play the demo before buying! also i think the dlcs are also worth it. i love this game, my opinion.",753.5
"this is my favorite game i have 100+ hours played. you can not go wrong with this game the hex grid is a very good choice for this game. a thing people dont like is the one unit per tile, but peronoally i like it because it leads to more stratigic play. you at no point need to go to war but it works well. if i were to have one critisisam it would be that taking cities is very unprofitable as it reduces the cities streanth significantly. other than that this game seems very solid and good.",280.2
"youll keep telling yourself one more round and then ill save and quit. just one more round and then it will be early morning the next day and you will still be playing. fact.",171.7
"one of the best games ive played in a while! good graphics, good ai and solo gameplay. the new expansion only increases the amount of replay value this game has to offer!",90.6
"beautiful, addicting and challenging at the higher difficulty levels. highly recommended to anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games and enjoys a bit of city building. do yourself a huge favor and pick up the brave new world expansion. you wont regret it!",89.4
"highly addictive - will literally stay up all night playing this game",66.7
"this game is very good, but i recommend purchasing a complete edition with all the expansion packs, as civ v cuts out a lot of material that was in civ iv. much of this, (such as the spread of religion, the spy unit, etc.) was released in later expansions, which was quite the rip-off. its still an amazingly fun game however, despite this shortcoming.",155.2
"requires the brave new world expansion, but with that it finally surpasses civ iv",140.0
"such an amazing game! i give it 5 out of 5, great replay value! my friend and i play this game all the time.",161.0
"been playing the civilization series since the third installment. i was worried at first when reading articles about the game long before it released - concerned that this might ruin the franchise. when i picked up this most recent installment i was glad to see i was wrong. the changes made to the series in this game are welcome in my opinion. recently, the gods & kings expansion came out that has rekindled my passion for this series. i expect great things to come out of future expansions and the newly integrated steam workshop.",390.7
"civ5 is a great game if you are looking for a virtualized board game. a great mix beween war, economy, culture, and technology. a solid quote that you might want to take into consideration before buying this game, one does not simply play a quick game of civ. if youre looking for a game to play for hours on end by yourself, or with your friends youve come to the right place. highly recommend.",213.4
"amazing game. very addicting if you know the tactics. my favourite civ is currently william of the netherlands.",77.6
"this game is awesom :) , its really about strategy ! but it take u so much time to finish a game ! besides dat ! everything is fine in this game",12.1
"be careful, or youll find that all your time has magically disappeared.",114.7
"greatest stratagy game in existance, love the nukes!!!",138.6
"sid meiers civilization v is the best game of the the 5. i have played all the series from civ 2 and i can say that civ v is the best turn based strategy game out there.",111.3
"the reason i got this game was because i watched the yogscast play this game so i decided to buy this but i dont think this game is complete without brave new world. even though i say that i would still rate it 5 stars because i have bought all the expansions for this game and will continue to",435.5

"its great very good if u want to make an empire or just farm and study tech, its just great and make sure u get brave new world its even a better game with it!",138.0
"the most polished version of civilization yet. a must own for anyones library.",162.1
"i absolutely love this game. its hard to stop playing it. if you are looking for an addictive strategy game, this is the game to buy. with so many different types of scenarios and mods you can incorporate, theres literally no end to this game. strategy games were never my cup of tea until this game came along. its hard to point out anything that is being done wrong in this game and the expansions make this game even better.",604.3
"all i can say is - simply fantastic. i played its predecessor, revolution, and while that was rather fun, i would say that civ5 is an upgrade between two slices of bread and smothered in jam. a huge repetoire of units and buildings combined with a highly intelligent combat system enables fluid, fast-paced war directed your way, and detailed diplomacy enables you to create a cold war-scenario with your enemies. hell, with nuclear weapons in place, you could simply engulf anyone who spills your tea in an atomic cluster if you wanted to. overall, im going to slap a 10/10 label onto this. buy it. nao.",87.6
"do you know that feeling when you lead your civilization and become the greatest in the world? its awesome.",282.7
"honestly my all time favorite game. i cant stop playing it.",163.6
"amazing. everything! say goodbye to your life. say hello to your new one, in sid meiers civilization v!",140.4
"if you love turn based strategy this is a must own game. the only issue is the game software does not efficiently use the hardware of your system so you need some powerful hardware to play this game on top settings on the largest maps, especially during the late game the lag can become nearly unbearable.",892.2
"most complete and compelling game in the series, the add-ons and patches fixed just about anything i had to complian about over the years",211.5
"many, many, many fun hours in this game. so many different ways to play. if you want to buy this game, get the gold edition, you will have most of the dlc and will have saved over $50 if you bought all the dlc seperate.",150.6
"excellent game! totally worth the money, intricate while simple 10/10",198.5
"very few games stand the test of time as well as civ. i played civ iv for years, and now im back into civ v. its a fun game that really allows for multiple playthroughs on just about any setting. with steams workshop available for this game, its unbelievably fun!",32.8
"only had this game for a week and i already have 42 hours on it, my second game was a 18 hours straight game so in other words say goodbye to you social life once you start a game :)",114.6
"its great game. i played all the versions since back in college on a 286 with floppy disks. you want to lose famly and friends play this game for a few hours. games never end on the nex turn until its midnight. lol",236.9
"all civs have been fun to play, but this one steps it up. there is always so much to do and manage when playing this game. micro your individual cities while having to macro your entire civilization is a fun challenge. with so many different ways to win other then build a lot of military and attack, many types of people would be attracted to try this game. multiplayer with friends is also a great way to lose an afternoon.",322.7
"this is a very fun game with numerous mechanics, which increase with the dlcs, however, the main 2 dlcs (brave new worlds, gods and kings) are fairly costly as they are the same price as the base game saying this gods and kings is only 10 when you buy or upgrade to the gold edition. the 2 main dlcs make the game very much more enjoyable and the smaller dlcs expand very much on the verity of the game. i would recommend the game to be played on single and multiplayer, also i would recommend buying the gold edition and brave new world when they are on sale which they often are in seasonal sales.",349.4
"why are you not playing this? stop reading and go play. the 2 expansions are a must, dont even think of not geting them.",437.5
"while many of the dlcs should have been included from the start, or given away for free, the overall experience is awing. the game draws you in and steals hours & days of your life. and while the game itself is worth the play, it is the modding community that really offers the replayability. some mods (such as faerun) completely transform the game, while others add new content (civilizations, maps, scenarios, tools) within the confines of the current layout. having sunk so many hours into the game, i still find myself going back for more.",178.9
"excellent global strategy game. isnt as clumy as civ iv and with the best combat system of all civs.",234.7
"one of the most amazing pc gaming of this generation that is base in around the board srategy game. two expansion release came out, the god and king which i have gotten before then the second expansion release of the brave new worldhave an incredible playthrough of new civ and new thing to look at, the rating i would have given with the regular civ is 8/10 but the first first expansion given 9/10 and the last expansion is given of a full 10/10.",602.3
"civ v is one of the best games ive played in awhile. i would definitely reccomend it.",60.4
"get this game, just do yourself the favor. get all of the dlc, i dare you.",120.5
"just one more turn...wait its what time in the morning?! fantastic game with fantastic mod support thanks to the steam workshop. vanilla game is great too",842.5
"very deep and involved turn based strategy game where you take a nation from nothing to top of the world. is extremly fun and can end up sinking quite a few hours if you arent careful.",202.2
"awesome game. it took me a little effort to learn to handle the city menu, but the game is pretty addicting",74.5
"i have endless amounts of fun playing this game, solo and with friends. a total must buy for any turn based strategy enthusiast",33.3
"this has to be the most well balanced civilization yet, i have been playing since civ 3, its still a personal favorite of mine maybe because its from my childhood but regardless, this civilization is balanced it is much harder to conquer a city than in previous incarnations which is the way it should be! i also like the fact that cities dont instantly take to your empire. the amount of choices and ways to focus on winning the game are absolutely marvoulous.",125.8
"its a great strategy game that is very easy to get into.",407.2
"if you like turn based strategy games, this is it!",118.7
"the game may take a long time to play, but once you start to grow your civilization into the later years, it becomes more and more fun. even though after you beat it once its hard to play again for a while, it is still a fun game and does bring you back in. the multiplayer however is pretty buggy, but when it works, it is also lots of fun.",292.5
"best turn based game ever and the only good one too.",32.1
"one of the most time consuming games i have ever played. spent hours playing through the tutorial.",42.9
"i liked the game. though you have to like a game that takes time to play. :)",153.1
"remember what happens in a civ game stays in a civ game",376.9
"ive been playing civilization since civ3, and i am not disapointed at all with this game. great graphics, incredible tech tree, and the dlcs are some of the greatest add-ons yet. with great modding allowed even, it just gets better. if you love turn based strats, you wont go wrong here. get it now, rule the world later",130.8
"i found this game to be super fun and rewarding. i cant wait to try out the multi-player. my only complaint with the game is with them using bismark instead of hitler, who is a lot more well known, and lets face it, was a more successful leader.",42.7
"you will not realize you put a week into this in one sitting until you die of thirst. yeah, its that addicting and absorbing.",53.9
"great game so differnt empires so many differnt so many ways to play your game could turn around with deal that was not thought through",60.4
"do you enjoy rubbing elbows with snooty leaders? do you enjoy building cities, researching technology and advancing through the ages to become a superpower and slowly take control of the planet? also dont be put off by this games apparent depth. games can last weeks and months, its true, but they can be played at any pace and picked up or put down at any time. that is one of the best things about this game, you can play for an hour or 16, and save your game and come back to it a week later and pick up right where you left off. overall: 7/10",5.6
"this game is like crack. turn based but complex. i have to force myself to stop sometimes.",118.2
"this game is fun. when it works. when it doesnt is is .",34.3
"this game is absolute garbage. it is a waste of money even if you only pay a penny. the lead designer was let go i.e. fired right after this game was made. this game is nothing like the previous ones, it is extremely shallow, as in facebook game quality, in-depth. when you play this game you are basically just hitting end of turn endlessly. combat is just a cluster of moving single stack units which endless block each other and gob up limited pathways. war is just a dull game of paper rock scissors. if you played civ4 bts and are looking for a quick fix, try the total war series; rome, rome ii, shogun ii: fall of the samurai, empire (neat naval battles), and medieval ii (yes you can sail to the americas). having a colonoscopy with no lube, and then later finding out that was actually not your doctor but an intern who just has a butt fetish.",445.0
"i had the second one when i was younger and i was not prepared for the awesomeness of this game. prepare to lose track of time while playing.",10.6
"exellent strategy game, solo and multiplayer offer great diversity.",476.4
"excellent game especially with the gods and kings dlc",228.5
"i would say a downgrade from what civilization iv was. the game seems more dull and repetitive. the price also has not gone down much but i guess that doesnt matter. one improvement to the game was the new hexagonal map and being able to culturally expand via gold and improvement of the production. i would say save your money an buy civilaztion iv though.",156.5
"as fun and addicted a civ game as ever. interface is very clean and streamlined. proudly continues the legacy of the series and will leave you awake in the wee hours of the morning muttering one more turn... to yourself. great game.",37.4
"i liked this game quite a bit in vanilla, but the replay value was a bit stale for my taste. the brave new world dlc has really beefed up the midgame, and offered a variety of new options that keep games fresh. still not sure it was worth $30, but grab it during a sale and you wont be disappointed.",294.6
"grand strategy at its finest without being too complicated. great fun alone or with friends and easy to pick up. just beware that its a time sapper. before ones knows whats happen 12 hours have past and the game still isnt finished.",91.2
"one of the best, if not the best, strategy games. with g&k and bnw this has reached the current pinnacle of the civilization series. 1 unit per tile system, interesting culture/tourism game, religions, personal ai opponents and policy system with great random maps and game settings gives hundreds if not thousands of hours of replay value.",1048.8
"if beyond earth(there new game if you dont know) is haft as good as this game i will get it",224.0
"without a doubt the best turn-based strategy game ever created.",65.5
"fun, turn based strategy-game taht all should own. can be annoying (having some one build a wonder that you had one turn left on or having a friend back stab you), but is an enjoyable game that has endless possibilites. want expansions sooo bad. the complete edition pack looks like a very good deal. love civ!",356.1
"this is the best strategy game i have ever played. there are so many things going on at once, you really fell involved with the short clips and battles. its almost impossible to play the same game twice.",68.7
"if you see the amount of hours i have spent on this civ 5, you will see i clearly love this game. this game frustrates me, challenges me and is satisfying when you conquer the world. this game is great!!",1020.4
"too many hours to count. too many mods to list. love it!",187.4
"you will waste all of your time playing this time sink",182.0
"amazing turn base stratergy game, can get lost in it for hours",75.2
"this game really makes you lose track of time. fun and very addicting!",35.5
"great game, just dont play it if you have something to do in the next 4-8 hours",561.3
"have an extra, oh i dont know, month or so to kill? civ v is about as in depth of a strategy game youll find, and by far one of the most fun. the 5th in the long line of great games, this one is worth the time, and the dlc.",522.2
"wonderful! the first hour you will just not understand nothing, but take your time and get comfertable with the game! just wonderful game!",46.2
"with both expansions installed, civ 5 finally becomes as complex as previous installments (they add religion, world congress, etc). ai still kind of sucks at combat, but otherwise its a great game that you can sink many hours into.",1063.9
"excelent game in the series, my favorite since call to power. the game complexity is such charming, and youll hardly find any comprehensive material about it. most of times, youll just need to learn on your own. hex tiles and non-stacking military units resulted in a very strategical militar combat planning, as opposed to the death stcks of the game predecessors. graphics are just gorgeous. sometimes you want to go to war just to watch some swords swinging. soundtracks as always are excelent and immersive. infinite city spawn is sadly still a problem, but much better than the other games in the series. recommended!",169.0
"civilization v is the latest game in a series which has spanned more than a decade. its cool, the games are downright awesome but most importantly, the game is fun. with the gold edition, the players gain the chance to play as one of over 34 different civilizations. whilst the games are lengthy, the idea of competeing against your friends and other ai in diplomatic and military solutions as well as economic, cultural and scientific all add to the joy. this game is the stratgy game. i strongly advise you to give it a go. its not complicated. and its not hard.",103.7
"a epic game! the game is hard and takes skill to play. if you lied games like master of orion, this game is like that just a different theme, based on human history, and more in depth. i have played countless hours of this game and do not understand the gripes with this game. civilization was made for gameplay not graphics. about the only gripe i do have is that the game does get kinda laggy as there are a lot of big civilizations, but it is not that big of a deal. this is because it takes longer for the computer to think about what moves to make. be prepared to spend many many hours playing civilization each game takes many hours to finish. but it is fun and addictive. i do not have the brave new world expansion, but those i know who do have it say it is great. i do however have gods and kings",170.8
"really good. best stradegy game i ever played (i havent really played any others)",9.2
"there is no reason not to own this game. have played lots of hours with the base game and all the expansions and even if i got tired of it there is a large moc community on the steam workshop.",452.1
"this game is freaking fantastic and i definitely recommend buying this game. this is the type of game you can spend hour upon hour playing with a freind or by yourself.",199.8
"a really fun stratagy game that i would rank number 1 on its list its a must have for any stratagy game lover, also fun with friends, always fun to see whos better",250.2
"civilization yo get the elder scrolls leader mod get the game scrub do it",341.1
"this is a great strategy game to play alone or with friends.",208.9
"i have a problem with playing this game. it will easily eat up an evening without me noticing that time has passed at all. i keep coming back to it.",323.6
"probably the best strategy game out there if you are looking for a good game to buy, this is your best choice!",62.0
"this game has consumed over 500 hours of my life...and i still want to play more.",1092.2
"worth buying as its one of those games of the one more turn genres. play with friends and buy when cheap if possible.",72.6
"ive just recently bought the game, and have played it for 4+ hours non stop. just as soon as you think you are at a good break point, you just keep on going. i had my doubts about this game, but even with the arcadish, non rts, battle mechanics, the game makes up for it in content, and flexability to bring your empire where ever you choose. coming from a real time strategy enthusiast, this game, definitely delivers. a must have, especially if you have friends to team up with online ;).",22.7
"great strategic gameplay. unfortunately the games seem to go on and on and on. still a good game. 7/10",6.6
"there is almost nothing more satisfying than simultaneously nuking america and the zulus out of existence. this game is a fantastic introduction to turn-based strategy games, and is a must have in any steam library.",83.0
"amazing game that comes with the added risk of completely taking away your sense of time.",509.4
"i am so unbelievably addicted to this game. i have stayed up until 4 in the morning for the past three days, just trying to beat it on easy. i shudder to think what the tougher difficulties have in store, but i am definitely looking forward to playing with friends. and leaving it open to the steam workshop is awesome, because who knows what crazy  stuff people will come up with.",71.4
"if u like strategy games there is no way around that game but it lacks a bit when it comes to multiplayer but its still the best strategy i ever played for sure.",228.4
"loved every hour of it. if you look at how much ive played it, it should count for something. however the diplomatic system on the game is far inferior to games like sid meiers alpha centari, but their getting there. the culture and faith upgrades done to the game however are beyond awesome. you can if your clever, win the game by never commiting to a war, which is a great change in the game. you should give it a try if you like turn based strategy or just strategy games wich containes more than just war. for this game is faaar deeper than just warfare.",439.6
"i love this game. its a game of stadigy where you have to control a city and make it the best you can and beat all the other players on the map before they come for you. allthough the orignal map is quite small, you can just turn the settings to a bigger map! i rate this game a 5/5 allthough it was missing some really good fitures out of civ 4, they made up for it by making it in the dlc. + the dlc is so worth it.",10.8
"just...one...more...turn... is what youll say when you play this game. one more turn as your cities grow and expand across the continent. one more turn as your armies march across the land, sea, and air to destroy your enemies. one more turn as your empire becomes the leading power and you sit back and marvel at your creation. this is truely an awesome game. if you are interested in empire building strategy, you wll spend many hours on this game. each match can last hours, and that is still when the game speed is set to fast. it is easy for beginners to pick up and play; there is a very basic tutorial difficulty to teach you the various mechanics of the game, your advisors will be there every step of the way to offer you strategic input, and the in game encyclopedia (named civilopedia) is there to expand your knowledge on individual aspects of the game and even teach you some history!",193.3
"it is very good after you have been taught how to play it by a friend but not as good as age of empires",10.5
"so far, for me, civ v is the most complex strategy game ive ever played.",275.5
"a brilliantly addictive strategy game and an excellent introduction to the civilization series! great fun over multiplayer (if you have the bandwidth)!",275.8

"you die a hero or you live long enough to become a villain",231.4
"i have long been a fan of the civilization style of games, though ill be honest, alpha centauri is my favorite sid meiers title of all time. all time. with that said, civ 5 is by far the most polished game, and with all of the addons coming in at the original cost of the game, im more than content to pay the price. hours and hours of gameplay and replayablilty. modability adds in even more replay value. steam workshop compatible! definitely a game for someone looking to do more than point a gun at something...",111.8
"the defining modern civilization simulator. everything is excellent, makes even the best computers hot with all the amazing engine work and calculations it does.",452.7
"probably the most fun ive had in a game for 10 years. easy enough on the lower difficulties to get a hang for the game, and hard enough once raised to difficulty 6+ to continue challenging your strategies.",322.8
"1st time trying a (rts) and and loving it .i was put off when i 1st seen it but it as one of the best beginners tutorial guide iv seen this game is a most buy",268.7

"didnt sleep for 72 hours, but denamark is dead now so 10/10.",212.8
"this game, the successor to the widly successful civilization iv, is even better in some respects. with gods and kings and brave new world, the diversity and playability of this game never ceases to amaze me. a good multiplayer match on civ v is one of the best ways i can waste my time.",305.5
"few strategy games can mach this empire builder in large army tactics. domatation isnt the only way to win, even if it is the easyest. allthow you cant get the full experiance without dlcs there are many ways to play this game.",166.3
"just played a game with my friend. i brought all my troops to his borders and attacked him without warning. we are no longer friends. 10/10",49.7
"sid meiers civilization v is a great strategy game that new and old players of the civilization franchise will love. it combines great ai with complex strategy mechanics to immerse the player into his own empire made from a vareity of cities and military might that the civilization franchise specializes in. however, the only downside to this game is the lack of interesting scenarios that only pricey dlc can supply. but despite the scenario problem, civilization v is a fun and exciting game to play with friends or by yourself against the difficult ais. i recommend this game.",98.9
"i like this game. i like how there are many different choices for play styles and civilizations",27.5

"hm wow what is there to say about civ five.... a whole lot. its a good game",23.9
"a good game with some good ideas. however the ai is still severely lacking (especially after playing betterai with civilization 4). the new happiness system is still really hard to use. the ai receives bonuses in this regard (and with most other things too)",172.6

"when you start playing this game time gets away from you way too fast! excellent game cant wait for civilization: beyond earth",72.1
"great game if you are looking to destroy hours of your time. for achievement hunters like myself, there is always one more thing to do; and the multiple offical mods are fun (not to mention the unoffical ones). pick your favorite historical figure and mess up history like a kitten with a ball of yarn!",559.7
"one of the best 4x series and the 5th installment does not disappoint.",79.4
"civ 5 is an awesome game if you are patient and like strategy games. if you are not patient or do not like strategy games you will not like this game at all. before you start you pick a civilization to rule as, the lenth of the game, the size of the map determining the amount of other civivlizations, the map shape, and the difficulty. then you start the game and play as your civilization you picked from 4000 bc to 2050 ad or until you win or get taken over. there are a few different victories; cultural, scientific, economic, and domination victories. you can also play after you win so you can take over any county, win the un, or launch a space program whatever you want to do. i would recommend this game for any one with a decent amount of patients.",42.1
"its an excellent 4x game. its almost like a really comprehensive version of risk but on your computer. offers very large replay value has a high skill ceiling while still being accessible for new comers. easy to play hard to master. would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a quality strategy game.",68.2
"civilisation v is a quite complex (and lengthy) strategy game. if you are into strategy games and have several hours to kill, then civ v is my prefered game of choice. despite what you may hear, even the worst of computers can run civ. however the problem with civ v is that for it to be a decent game you need to get dlc. i personally suggest saving up about 30-40 and buying all the dlc in the summer sale, where it is much cheaper.",173.9
"a game intricate enough to make me not desperate to win it. the game play is fun enough on its own, without the added joy of beating someone.",49.6
"civilization v is a perfect strategy game. if youre new to strategy games you will still love it and it offers you hundreds and hundreds of hours for gameplay. multiplyer is amazing too espically with friends. also try to buy the brave new world expansion pack. that will enhance the game and youll play it even more. even the angry army supports this game. (angry joe).",452.6
"civilization 5 is one is the best ever strategy games and i highly recomend it to any new steam person",52.8
"one of my old favourites. enjoying the brave new world expansion pack as the game isnt really much fun without it, great game though and i suggest that you buy!",218.8
"will suck you in!!! awesome game with great expansions!",113.4
"do you wnt a game where you can nuke ghandi? well its your lucky day!",55.1

"this game is a looooooooooooooooooooot of fun. defs recommend.",42.4
"simply stated, the civ franchise is the best turn-based strategy games. civ5 has done the franchise justice while continue to improve the game overall from its predecessors.",999.6
"this game is addicting and can be super intense and relaxed at the same time. if that makes any sense.",34.7
"best stratigy game out there. compex but simpe, and there is plenty of epic civ 5 falures, and even victorys. buy it now, and i am off to play civ 5.",147.8
"great game, i will invariably spend hours on this game in the future with my mates.",176.2
"youll never have more fun losing hours of your life without you even noticing. its challenging, engaging and new each time with multiple win scenarios that allow you to play a different way each time. i cant recommend this game enough, especially when you play with others. the only problem is that it can be very buggy at times, especially towards late game and even more so when you play with friends. i wish that there were options to have the animations and such in multi-player but they opted out to save on wait time. still, over all, love this game!",475.8
"single-player itself is a reason to buy this game, not to mention multiplayer. if youve ever played a civ or other strategy game, you will enjoy this. if you do buy, make sure you get the gold edition and the brave new world expansion, or the complete edition, since there is so much dlc. 9.5/10 must own",56.4
"great turn based strategy game. its relatively user driven, in that you can make one game last for 10 hours or 100 hours, whatever your preference. you can fly through the game using auto productions and other ease features, but there are great opportunites for micromanaging galore if that is your suit. loads of dlc make the game a lot more fun, especially the addition of religion, as well as the reworked global political system, cultural victory, and diplomatic victory, as seen in the brave new world expansion. i would suggest playing on prince difficulty or above however. aside from learning the game, anything lower then that is rather broken in terms of ease of victory. watch out for ghangis khan.",206.3
"this game is simply amazing. its like playing a board game on your computer and its incredibly interactive with a great amount of detail. and the dlc only make it better and each one is well worth its price. 10/10 would play again.",315.0
"gamer is so good it makes you punch your own face.",123.8
"massively addicting. several time i started a game with just a few hours to spare and ended up staying up until 4am for just one more turn... i really like the change to one military unit per tile and the hexagon tile system. alot of the systems from civilization iv have been migrated over and tweaked. the only real negative is that there have been more bugs with civ v than i experienced playing civ iv, but in all fairness i did start playing iv after it had a few expansions. the latest expansion makes the game after around the renaissance era much more diverse and interesting. before, you pretty much could only advance your military and continue building up your progress to victory. if you werent doing a domination victory, the game could become monotonous (depending on your neighbors), but that has been fixed from what i hear with brave new world.",272.7
"you have to get this game as it is amazing and the mods give even more replay ability",291.0

"this is an amazing game to play with a somewhat beefy computer. its is a good game to play with friends",21.6
"this game has ruined my social life ... i love it!!",31.2
"great game, i was a bit sceptical of the new layout with the different paragons from civ: iv, but i have since grown accustomed to the hexagons instead of plain squares. the game itself is awesome, with both the leader/civ traits and the special units, you have a lot of different road to head down with your civ. you can choose to go all out agressive if you have strong earlygame units or are a good diplomat with the citystates. there isnt two games that are alike. the map changes, the opposing ai does, and the attitude of nearby city states (whom you either please or ignore) makes the game feel like a new experience each game",136.9

"this game encourages you to be a complete psychopath. you will begin to laugh as you drown your enemies in their own blood, blowing up all their cities with nuclear missiles. and all they can do it watch helplessly as you crush the life out of everything they love. endless, boudless joy. every time.",294.3
"this is the best civ by far. not being able to stack units sounds like crap but it adds tons of thinking into your wars. also its the most accesible civ game by far. p.s brave new world makes it civ 6",250.1

"this game is awesome! ive spent so much time playing it. i really recommend it.",157.7
"base game has large amount of content and is very good. brave new world dlc added new breath of life into a game that was staring to get a bit boring, would reccomend buying after getting a feel for the game.",102.7
"this game is great. its a fun addicting way to waste time. it, however, does have some flaws. the a.i.s dont exactly act the way people would and lots of the later game units are really gimicky and unbalanced. luckily, they created expansions to the game to amend their past mistakes. its kind of a puss-out to make the dlc include civilizations instead of just releasing all of them with the game, but it makes up for it with new play styles, scenarios, and feel for the game. on its own, the game is a 6.5/10. with the dlc (especially brave new world), i becomes a 9.3/10. for any fan of the strategy genre, i highly recommend this game. have fun!",198.0
"civ v... its hard to say it keeps up the standard. it looks better, feels like it makes more sense.. but in general it also feels very lacklustre. it doesnt help that the dlc is infecting what was a wonderful franchise, so i am glad sid meier has managed to reclaim control over the ip. funfact: all of civ vs dlc to date was already included in civiv or became included in much more substantial expansions. now they cost 3-4 each and total 31... id say youd be better off getting civ iv, or civ ii. civ v is good, but its future isnt glowing as bright as it used to.",95.6
"amazing strategy game with hours of fun to be had, either playing solo or with friends. for the full experaince i highly recommend getting the dlc for this game as it truly makes all the game mechanics complete, but the core version is still fun nonetheless. if you like strategy games that drain your time, this is a must have game.",449.9
"anyone who loves a strategy type of game will love this one. i was very happy to be able to take over the world and decide how i should destroy my opponents. great game, and i definitely recommend it.",108.9
"most addicting game ive played since minecraft, humblebundle ftw! 10/10",87.8
"lots of hours of fun! with a lot of different scenarios and presets, you can really relive some of earths greatest moments.. or maybe make your own new ones! however, the game can be a bit lacking in variety time to time, but if it gets that, just call your friends. this game is a hole other level when you try the multiplayer, especially if you know the people you are playing with. totally would recommend this game, because of its great gameplay, innovative features, and endless hours of fun, betraying your friends. if you plan on buying this game, you might as well just go the whole way and buy the dlc for the game. it is playable without them, but they really add to the already great experience.",104.5
"this is a really nice 4x style turn based game (although you must be prepared for a long game - multiple hours).",232.7

"hell yes i recommend this game.ummm.......it is a fun interesting game because every time you start a new game there is always going to be something different. for me the early game is preatty fun. but i think they should lower the price on the expansion packs like brave new world and gods and kings, i also recommend buying these expansion packs for a better expirience. may your civilization stand the test of time.",304.9
"took over the world and made everyone hate me. 10/10",18.5

"sid miers civillization v is one of the most detaled and surpriseingly accurite simulation games ever. allowing you to follow and controll almost every aspect of civilization from begining to end. i however am aganst games with micro-transactons 3.5 stars.",70.7
"sooooo adicting!!!!!! and fun!, if you buy it, prepare for sleepless nights:)",144.6

"love civ v and the hex grid. no more unit stacking, horray!",678.9
"this game is unique in so many levels. they make all the leaders act the same as if in real life and every difficulty has a diffrent strategy that only trial and error can solve. will you be warlike? or cultural? or even a gleaming beam of hope of technological wonders can your civilization hold as you conquer barbarian nations. can your empire stand the test of time?",295.4

"played this before work and all i did was think about it for the rest of the day",259.0
"this is the most incredable game ever! every time i play it a get addicted to the piont where my mom has to have me do something else. this game is a game where you can get allies and team up and take down someone else. it has an amazing multiplayer and i defenitly recommend this game. if i were rating it it would be like 1000/10 it is so good.",53.5
"this game is amazing, it really is, everything about this is, the combat, is fair and very nice to look at, the exploring is always different, you never have a dull experience, the economy is affected by almost everything you do, the other civilizations, incredibly detailed and immersive, theyre mere presence will give you shivers, you play this game, you feel like a ruler, but it is up to you what type of ruler you will be, in this game, you can create a civilization to stand the test of time.",46.5

"extremly time consuming game. really easy to get your moneys worth in game time. i have almost 300 hours in and have only (completed) one match. its a strategy game, but has lots of different aspects. it could be seen as more of a war strategy game, but its more than that. you have to manage your cities, your ecomonmy, diplomatic relations, religion, and technological advances. it takes a few hours to get into the game, but once you do it will be easy to get at least 100 hours out of it. 10/10",422.5

"wow. so stratergy. many culture. much fun. wow wow 5 doge out of 5 doge",119.7
"civ 5 is the high watermark thus far in the series. at this point in time, the game has been patched to be more than balanced and versatile. i hope in future iterations of this game that the music will be evermore expanded to include not only cultural influence, but developmental and incidental playlists.",91.9
"the origional game, gods and kings, and brave new world are $15 through the humble bundle for 10 more days, so get it.",334.8
"im not sure why civ v gets such a horrendous rep from the civ community. it took all the unncecesary elements from past civ games (like religion and stacked combat units for example) and either streamlined them or got rid of them altogether. that makes the game less of a slog as far as im concerned. civ v is still part of the civilization series no matter how much people want to complain about it, and it still plays like a civ game. in other words, civilization is still the watermark for turn-based strategy games, and no amount of tweaking or nerfing is going to change that.",142.9
"this game is probably by far one of the best stratagy game i have played. playing multiplayer is wonderful especially if you have some friends to play it with and it allows you to meet new people that obviousely like the same game as you. i would recomend this game to any person that loves a good strategy game. hence why im trying to convert as many people as i can to this game. have fun!!!!!",240.0

"civ 5 is one of those games that is so difficult to understand, so you spend hours and hours playing and learning the game, never able to fully perfect it. it is an amazing game to pick up and play, expecially on sale.",138.9

"for a four year old game, civ5 presents a fantastic experience on par with modern strategy games. with particular emphasis on individual turns, each game steadily develops into a robust (albeit historically inaccurate) simulation of competitive civilizations. though the learning curve might be somewhat steep, the in-game tips are helpful and generally non-intrusive. once you get the hang of the mechanics, youll be hooked. keep in mind that each game spans the history of the world and then some. so grab some friends and get comfy; this might take a while. absolutely recommend!",59.8
"an excellent new version of the game. the new rule of only one military unit per tile seems strange at first, but ultimately makes for more strategic gameplay. this is definitely one of those games that will have you thinking ok, only one more turn and then finding yourself still playing hours later. strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys the civilization series or strategy empire games. 9.5/10",129.2
"in sid meiers civilization v, you can choose a ancient civilization and build their empire the way you want. each civilization has its own upsides and downsides. you get to choose a map type, game pace, and difficulty. you can also choose how many ai you want to play with/against you. there is multiplayer, so you can play with some friends, or some randoms. i also highly recommend buying all of the dlc when you get the chance. it just adds more to the already amazing game. oh mighty player, can you sit on your  all day and play this game? can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? 10/10",63.8
"this game has been my life for more than 9 years. and so it continues...",288.7
"amazing game to play alone or with your friends. very relaxing at times, but you do need to think about how you will win or at least not lose in the first turns :d i have played it for years now and i absolutely love it. 5 stars, recommend it.",85.9
"i just love this game, the only thing i am not into is the long loading times. but the music and description for each culture, the quotes for every new technology and just the all out game play is great.",127.9

"the dull technology is anti-historical .every nation has similar tech .you are mongols of steppes -no problem . you can still build lighthouse of alexandria or collosus of rhodes -both monuments strictly made by very prosperous sea-faring nations. it is ridiculous . further more you can not set era when you want to halt the advancement. i dont feel playing modern era ,but i can not do nothing about it . even more the scenarios are awful . some of them as short as only 70 turns long. they simple threw some uncooked pseudo historic technology into the pot because it would take few dollars !!! to give every nation the tech it really could have access before the modern era. there are lot of people whoo does not care about anything for them this game is perfect . if you feel like doubtful about central american civilisations having cavalry or other nonsense then this game is not for you.",9.7

"they did it again, i strongly believe that the civilization series is one of the greatest works to teach about human history, achievements, our soul, our sins, our philosophy, our politics, our chances and decisions. it should be put on a working machine and send into space to show aliens that we are horrible, but at least we know how to heave fun. and where there is civilization, there is hope.",46.1
"fun game that steals your life and the respect of all people around you.",61.3

"if youve ever wanted to rule the world . . . .this game is for you. if youve ever wondered what developing a god complex is like, yeeeup. are you the type of person that would, if handed the reigns of civilization, put its full focus toward the development of fusion powered robots; just to satisfy a grudge from when denmark laid siege to your city and then denounced you in front of that cute celtic warrior gal? if so, i think you know what you must do. kiss your family and friends goodbye, forget about your dreams, plans, and aspirations; and play one more turn.",135.0

"buggiest, glitchiest, worst optimized game i have ever played in my life, i recommend buying a hard copy of this game rather than steam, unless you like freezing, crashing and not being able to load the game litterally probably every 10 minutes. tried many fixes online, but i am unimpressed with this game. go to hell sid meier",128.0
"relatively simple gameplay, yet surprisingly addictive (hence my 385 hours of gametime logged playing it). although a good game at launch, the two expansion packs released since do add a lot of depth to the gameplay and i would recommend purchasing the expansion packs if possible.",547.7

"when i fisrt played this game i though it was going to be hard and kind of boring. i was so wrong. it is not a hard game if you dont want it to be but it makes you think. this game both is complex with its realistic systems of military, constrction, science, religion, government, exploration etc. and easy to play with a good system to monitor over your empires production and unit movement with advisors to help you along the way. another thing i like is that each empire you play as has specific beneifits for that empire. also, you can win this game at many approaches. through, political, peacful negotiation or one of my favorite strategies domnination or a little bit of each whatever fits your playing style. i am now hooked to this game and i love love it love it. it might seem challenging and confusing at first but once you get the hang of it, its an amazing game to play.",38.0
"with the addition of brave new world, their is an added layer of complexity, but the overall rewarding gameplay is outstanding, ive sunk many a nights into this, both solo and with friends. i have run into some trouble playing over the internet and even local multiplayer, but this is most likely due to my various connections and not the game itself. one feature i would like to see implemented that doesnt exist is for the local multiplayer hot seat mode to also go online and allow multiple players locally as well as across a network.",135.3

"this is easily one of the very best turn-based strategy games. it takes all the good things from earlier iterations of the game, left out the bad parts, made a heavily addictive combination of it and even further refined the game to perfection with its two expansion packs. absolute must-have for every strategy lover out there!",88.8

"want a game that will keep you busy for hours, maybe not fun but certainly keep you busy... buy this game. wont say its my fav. of the civ series, but its not bad. my issue is with the expansion packs; you pay a lot of money and it never feels like you get much overall for that money. this is one of those cases while the game id buy if want it, id hang about for a sale on the expansions, especially brave new world as thats often more expensive then the actual game. :-/",101.1

"civilization v is not, strictly speaking, a bad game, but its unable to capture some of the raw unbridled awesomeness that the previous title in the series was able to harness. hopefully, like civ iv, the game will grow as expansions are released.",21.2
"this game is great and its better than its predecessors if and only if you get both of the expansions. without the expansions the game is really dull and lacks depth in certain areas.",253.2
"some of the personalities in this are annoying. like life. you can make friends with them and make enemies with others. like life. you can burn their villages and laugh while your troops roll over their young. .. i guess still kind of like life if you are a war lord.",16.7
"this game is one of the best strategy games ever (i havent played total war shogun yet so shut up) the variety in this game is amazing and the many settings you can put in your game before you play can massively change your gameplay (in a good way.) i could play this for hours and thats good because the games are insanely long 8-16 hours long. for one game.",49.6
"ive played 1 game so far. took 14 hours. i got second. 10/10",128.3

"games can be really long, but you can also save them which is nice. graphics are good, mid/late game you dont really notice the turn based as much unless youre with a slow moving friend. ai seems pretty smart and solid, feels like they can be cocky, submissive, ectect. fun game.",48.1
"very different from its predecessor, but with the brave new world expansion, civ v finally comes into its own and leaves you looking forwrad to that one more turn.",22.3
"while not as enjoyable as civ 4 for me, i really love civ v. ive sunk a lot of time into it, and always come back to it every few months. if stragety is your thing, stick this in your library.",59.8

"i never played civ 4, but civ 3 was grueling and slow, killing your desire to leave the house. civ 5 is the same, but man, it moves more smoothly. im sure you could play a game in half the time, and have a better time. turns are streamlined, multiplayer is reasonably fast and stable, and there is a great deal of depth to the game, particularly with the expansions. fighting can drag multiplayer game speed down and science seems to be far and away the best strategy, but this game has lasting top 10 steam power because of the depth and the awesome multiplayer.",209.0

"if deep, complex, but rewarding and intricate strategy games are your jam, this game is a must have. if you dont like strategy or slow games, this is not the game for you! this is meant for you folks who dont like time limits and just shooting at whatever is in front of you. this is for those of you who will take the very long time necessary to learn to play a game llike this.",35.0

"sure its fun...when youre able to learn how to play... itd be pretty helpful if the in-game system gave you more tips on how to navigate and place things around. this game will take hours away from your life...whether it could be bad or good.",43.8

"have a life? tired of it? get this game. no more life. problem solved.",150.6
"be aware this game can be extremely addictive, also note the fact that this game can take up lots of playing time which is a dangerous mix. apart from the temporary beginners addiction this game is brilliant, there are a huge amount of things to experiment with. the developers find somewhat of a good balance between in game capabilities of you and your civ and managed to not overload new players with excessive amount of options and things to manage. the beauty of it is you can always set up your match the way it suits you and chose when you want to get involved in more complex mechanics. if you like any kind of strategy whether itd be subtle, casual and slow or fast and intense this game will provide. civ 5 will make you think, laugh and bask in the sheer power it can make you feel. 8/10",304.1

"my only qualm is that this game is far too addicting. 5 minutes turns into 5 days really fast.",15.9
"as adictive as civ 2 and has better rules and graphics. i still miss the live-action advisors, however, and the advisors in this game are pretty useless. that said, buy it and kiss multiple nights goodbye.",127.2
"one of the best games i have played. all the expansions make it even better. it mixes the hardcore and hard parts of the previews games with a more easy and accesable new things in 5. is not in anyway easier or dumbed down. just made in a way so its faster to understand but still takes ages to master. get it",64.3
"one of the most addictive games ever. beautifuly made with great graphics and superb playability. many different settings available make civ v challenging even after thousands of hours spent in it. just a little slight improvements would make this game perfect. rating: 9.5/10",887.4
"alsome game to play loved every second of the game",93.6
"get this when its on sale. but not stand alone 8/10",49.3
"if you love strategy games and have 50 hours to waste, buy this game.",97.5
"while vanilla civilization v was a solid entry to the venerable series, the expansion brave new world really makes the game shine. id go as far to say that civ v: brave new world is a contender for best game expansion of 2013. the expansion reinvents how culture works in civ v and offers more interesting gameplay choices when it comes to trading and diplomacy. the only real criticism you could make is that they shouldve had these in the game in the first place! but thats just the way it is with civ expansions isnt it? :)",618.6
"a simple learning curve allows series newbies to be able to pick up the game and enjoy it, while a host of new features will keep civ veterans engrossed for hours. also, the dlcs are something to pick up, they introduce game transforming elements that make it feel like this is civ 6.",479.7
"global political crack cocaine. i nuked sweden and dropped a giant robot in china. 10/10",53.5
"intricate and customizable, the foundation of the game is solid and replayability long. the multiplayer is a touch cumbersome though.",186.7
"its one of those games where its worth getting the dlc. thats not always a good thing. aside from that the gameplay is addictive. from my experience the multiplayer is laggy but dont go by that it could be just me. this is a must for ppeople who enjoy strategy games and it also facilitates people new to this sort of thing.",44.1
"with the multiple dlc the game offers its able to keep us from leaving for other strategy games. games are never the same to me and i keep enjoying it even when i get smashed by the ai. looking foward to civ vi",139.8
"fantastic game!!! ive spend countless more hours than my hectic study schedule allows for!! love it!",189.4
"great game! not for people with a short antention span.",48.5
"over 50 awards for best strategy game. it worth all the money!!!",46.4
"an exellent game, one of the best that i have ever played. now stop reading this and buy it!!!",58.0
"love this game, but brave new world dlc is needed.",125.2
"one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time i would get it if you are a big fan of strategy 9/10",11.6
"quite enjoyable if you like turn-based strategic gameplay",204.2
"this game is the pinnacle of strategy, just the feel alone of controlling an entire empire rises above all else. i must say some areas of the game could be improved like the ai but if you get bored of many subjects in the game there is always mods to think about. dlc is also something to think about, even though its the price of the game i feel that it adds many more hours to the game and is worth the money. ive been playing this since it came out and im still enjoying it, with many civilisations and playstyles to choose from sid meiers civilisation 5 is the complete turn based strategy game. 9/10",360.2
"one a scale of 1-10 id give it a 9; it is a great game overall, but it doesnt account for the little things that make history dynamic, such as internal revolutions creating brand new nations, and it could use a bit more in the diplomacy, no removal, just addition.",188.1
"very well made game. still the best of its kind after several years and is a fun new experience every time you play. good game at improving your micromanaging skills as well as macro.",78.4
"civ v, visually more attractive than previous civs, seems not as immersive and deep. the addition of ranged units that can attack across multiple tiles is nice, the city states and barbarians are interesting. definitely worth picking up this game if you catch it on sale, but when its at full price, stick with previous versions.",433.6
"a lot of fun to play. warning though time will fly while playing this game",28.3
"in my opinion the best strategy game out there. a must own!!!",83.7
"it is as good as they say. my fav civ ii, actually. i am not entirely in love with how picking a government is set up (it is a bit too gamey, in a way, and you dont have the sense of being anything in particular) but the rest on the game is pure gold.",87.7
"grand-strategy game that consumes more of your hours than is healthy. just one more turn easily turns into 5 hours. not for people looking for a quick-and-dirty strategy game like starcraft.",183.3
"i could easily lose my entire life to civ. makes for strange conversations trying to explain to people whats happening, so worth it.",31.9
"easy to pick up and play. strategy is fun and intuitive and the persona of the characters bring the game a lot of depth. easily a game you can sink 100+ hours into without even trying.",293.5
"a competative,fun,addictive game good for competative players and good for people that have loads time to spare id recommend this to anyone who is into building an econamy up and loves controlling units",257.9
"hours of fun and countless reasons to play again and again.",47.3
"sid meiers civilization v, known to the community as civ 5 is in my opinion one of the top five games i have ever played. it has the perfect amount of strategy and depth. civ 5 gives you hours of enjoyment, and will bring you a giddyness undescribable by human emotions and words. if you are waffeling with the desision. buy. this. game.",109.3
"this game is a must have. i heard that from everyone and never really realized the truth behind those words until i recieved the game as a christmas gift from one of my buddies. this game is truly amazing and i cannot sing its praises enough. sure, it is slow and rather relaxed, but even with all of the dull-paced games i can honestly say that i was never bored. all of the posatives are enhanced tri-fold when you play this with a few friends. a four or two pack would be nice. i reccommend this to anyone looking for something new or a change of pace.",30.6
"this game is amazing! i recommend it for anyone who enjoys stratedgy games, it is one of the best ever made.",603.8
"the game is so rewarding if you put the effort into it. great game totaly worth the cost.",155.2
"just one more turn.. one more.. one.. and then you lose about 5 days of your life. worth.",138.3
"this is an amazing strategy game thats fun and will always be challenging your skills",139.2
"this is a game that is easy to come back to on those quiet nights. every play through is different because of all the combinations of ways to win. this is especially fun in multiplayer but turns can start to take a really long time as the game progresses.",143.7
"a fun game without the expansion gods and kings, but with it, it becomes one of the best turn based strategy games ever made. fun in multiplayer or singleplayer, easy to run and max out. it also has a bevy of fantastic mods, all easy to install with the steam workshop.",278.1
"this game is a gift from the heavens and at the same time an addiction buy this game, but do not get sucked into it or youll be up till 4 in the morning every night, with your girlfriend breaking up with your mom disowning you and the italian mob hunting you down heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelpppppp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! me jk but do buy this game by the way",179.4
"decent game to play when you are bored  of playing everything else. not as good as the previous civ game",707.4
"really good game its nice to build an empire from the start",30.2
"very fun, if not addicting game to play with friends over lan or internet! totally buy it.",296.5
"the brave new world adds a lot to cultural victory and make attaining a diplomatic victory much more enjoyable. the game still bogs down at end game with large maps and/or players. multiplayer stability is a bit better, but it still does suffer from desync issues, but manages to recover fairly well. i have personally not suffered from any multiplayer complete crashes in this expansion pack. this is one of the best turn-based strategy games available. well worth the purchase if you dont mind many hours envolved in game-play.",455.8
"i love the game ive playedb 140 hours of it in 1 month",572.5
"the greatest time vortex ever. start playing and when you next look at the clock many hours have gone....",164.1
"civilization has long been one of my favorite franchises, ever since i played the first one as a kid. they went through a weak period with iii, but iv was great and v is the best entry in the series yet.",164.5
"love the game. glad my computer can actually play it. might use some free time to play this again. :)",173.4
"sid meiers civilization v is an awesome improvement to the previous versions for long-time fans, but also has opened the door greatly for those that have not had the chance to play this line of games before. this is definitely one to check out!",651.8
"this game has all that you could want without feeling pretencious. get it.",161.6
"its good but you will end up playing it for like 15 hours straight",33.5
"i have spent the most hours on this game. a game that i  for. it is so lovely when you nuke the enemys capital, and when you go on super easy so you just dominate just for the hell of it. if you dont like this game, you havent played it or given it a real try.",517.2
"this game is simply a must have for all people who have steam.",269.6
"ill be going to bed soon honey! just one more turn!",20.5
"lots of different ways to win, which keeps it varied. but who can resist the ever popular burn everything to the ground approach?",51.4
"this game is the best! it is one of the best stratigy games of all times. i highly recomed buying it.",5.5
"at first it can be a little confusing but once you get the hang of it its pretty addictive.",83.3
"great game with nearly all of the features you love thinking about the classic civilization and many improvements.",194.7
"a streamlined civ4 minus the stack of doom. civ5 is the best of the old with the new. 10/10 especially if you have all of the dlc and expansions which balance the game mechanics.",277.8
"civ 5 is an amazing game, once you start a game you will want to finish. i started as britain and over a few thousand years i had managed to be hated by the whole world, this is when i decided to strike. i started with india demolishing there country and army with my huge force of advanced soldiers, war in civ is quite tactical and requires planning; i started by surrounding the border with my army and naval force and then when my army is together i launch the attack and overwhelm the opponents army. i conquer india and proceed onto more countries. i managed to destroy every country in the world except america and ethiopia when i decided i had spent way too long on the game! :d 9.5/10",112.3
"a fun, strategic game with simple to set up multiplayer and so many different ways a game could go, from peacefull days to nuclear apocalypse, its one of the greatest games to play!",138.2
"the best series of all time as always in good shape. its my favorite and the worst game ever... why ? because iv lost so much time playing this game ^_^",70.6
"took a while to get used to as this game is quite different from its predecessor; however, i felt that this is one of the best ever in the series.",470.3
"laid back, slow-pased strategy game. its a bit of a combination between the board games: risk, and colonists of catan. for me its the ideal game to pass a weekend where you just dont feel like getting away from your computer. even if its still 30 euros. very much worth it.",104.0
"i recommend civ 5. yeah, initially i was skeptical. zomg they simplified civ 5 you s! but honestly? a lot of that was simply fat trimmed from a swaggering, bloated cow. the core game has needed a rather serious refactoring, particularly military units which civ 5 addresses. not perfectly, mind you, but i like the direction it is taking. and yes i know its civ v not civ 5, but that just sounds like some kind of disparaging slang. you civvie!",72.7
"200 hours in and i still keep coming back. the base game is decent, but the real fun is with the gods and kings and brave new world expansion packs.",307.1
"not significantly different from civ4 and a surprising profusion of rough edges for a aaa titlea disappointment.",13.8
"very enjoyable and flawless game that is a perfect time sink. defo buy if you have the chance too.",1.2
"the 4x strategy game against which all others are compared. achievements are buggy, so if you are an achievement hunter, you will be dissappointed. you do not always receive the earned achievements. if you use the mods, you will get no achievements whatsoever.",114.3
"this game is addicting it turns someone who hated turn based strategy games into an addict of them and its amazing...might want to not start a game of it before you go to bed because you will stay up all night and play it this is a very long game but i recommend it to everyone! it also is steam workshop enabled so that means you can mod it up and play on the same maps as tamriel in elder scrolls and the lands in the lord of the rings! giant death robot nuff said",170.8
"this is a great turn by turn strategy game. build your empire, by brute strength or push for diplomacy. with all the add ons and mods, there are hours upon hours that could be spent enjoying this game. my only issue, is with the constant crashing on apples os. otherwise, i would highly recoomend it.",35.5
"new expansion pack adds many new elements to the game keeping it fresh. love this game, highly recommend!",324.9
"japan denounced me after i helped him start a world war. 10/10",164.7
"dont be put off by turn-based strategy, it really is an egaging game",196.6
"the world is full of mondays. and hexagons. and giant death robots. at least when people get futuristic technology. until then... well... we are frolicking about with clubs and spears blind in some clouds... life. ahh i love it. actually i hate it. i only love it when i get giant death robots and blow up the world! burn hahahahahaha buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurn! hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ahem. yeah. get it.",27.2
"easily one of my favorite games, but beware! most begin playing and then realize 10 hours later that they should really go to bed or work or something, but you just gotta finish this war or found that last city and get your happiness up. its easy to fall down the hole of ill just take this one last turn and then im turning it off and continue to do that for hours. great game. if you love strategy games, youll love civ v. highly recommend the gods and kings and brave new world bundles which will really expand your game play options and keep it fresh.",365.1
"in all honesty, a game that is fun for the first few days but got boring really fast. there was no editor and really nothing else to do but the campaign. the mods were fun and entertaining for a long period but also got boring. not game worth 60$ but if they added some extra stuff i would definately buy it for 60$ again.",413.0
"mixed feelings: pros: -its civil. it has been simplified on some parts, but is good. -nice graphics. cons: -unbearable wait times. i really mean it. on a huge map, on advanced turns it took about 10 minutes to just load a saved game! and about 5 minutes each turn just waiting the machine thinks. -very bad diplomacy. its almost impossible to get a balanced deal. the computer always want to have a very unbalanced deal. -no spies, no sharing tech between cultures. -spain as a dlc?! come on, they were one of the main cultures on every civil. the wait times killed the whole thing. it cant be possible that it took too long each turn to think.",166.0
"sid meier is back with civ v. after a rocky start with the base game, the two expansions gods and kings and brave new world add the meat back to the civilization hot pocket. recommended with gods and kings minimum.",200.4
"quite addictive and a good bit of historical fun if you like turn-based games. they did a great job.",7.8
"man this is a good game but barabarians can easily make your game a living hell. also, other civs will get real mad for settling like five tiles away. what the heck is up with that.",63.3
"this will eat your life. but in a fun way. just one more turn!",141.5
"runs horrid on a sony vaio flip. it is so bad with understanding screen orientation or resolution you can not do anything beyond watch the game intro. glad it was a free download and not something i paid for.",0.2
"best civ game yet, even better with the expansion packs.",193.9
"amazing game. the fact that you can go any direction with a large amout of civilizations makes it playable for a long time, with each experience unique.",18.5
"im a huge fan of real time strategy games, and i have to admit, the last civilization game i played was civ 3. either i am older and wiser now or this is a superior game. incredibly addictive (one more turn turns into one more century, etc) i still prefer real time, but i think im coming around to turn- based",17.4
"very good game and it never gets boring played 24 hours strait plus food breaks",55.1
"i didnt think this was going to be my thing, but after realease i had missed two meals while doing my first playthrough it became obvious how well-made this game is. if you like anything about history, turn-based games, or simcity - but dont like cities - then this is the game for you.",14.1
"i have to say, go for it. it should be on sale in a few days pick up a couple dlcs while youre at it. i am still torn on what i thought of gods and kings. while i liked the introduction of spying and religions, i felt that the religion portion felt more like an after thought.",415.5
"this is a fun / calming game it takes forever and is turnbased",237.1
"you can do multiplayer with a friend, play as the aztecs, and nuke every city they own in 2012. 10/10 would nuke again",195.7
"with all the expansions that are currently out it is the best civ game that ive played in a while. 10/10",291.2
"if youre a fan of strategic group games, then this game is perfect for you. granted that the games do take a couple of hours to complete, this is a good game if you have plenty of time. the game uses a very good diplomacy system, with your actions reflecting on your allies and how your fellow nations see you. be sure not to rely on your friends too much, in a game where the strongest nation is the smartest nation, you dont want to be a liability. you really do just play your own way, you can pillage and slaughter your way to victory or try and be the first country to launch a space mission to alpha centauri, its all up to you. there are a whole heap of different nations to choose from, celts being one, greeks another, or even mongolians. build and break alliances all in the name of victory... not a game for those who cant handle betrayal.",56.2
"be aware, this is a time machine. one...more....turn...................................",613.5
"one of the best strategic games i have played. hell, this is the best ever. you can play it for years and you will not get bored, theres always something new to see or achieve. just one more turn...",419.7

"this game is great for anyone looking to get the most play time and experience out of what theyre paying for.",16.4
"one of the best this kinda games! easy to play with friends also very fun! recommand this game for every person! go and get this game!",114.6
"super fun game. civ 5 is a lot easier to get the hang of and explains stuff in a way we can actually understand!",17.2
"i dont know if there is a game series i have played more than the civilization series. i fell in love with civ iii and civ v blew all my expectations for a sequel game out of the water. in addition, the dlc is fantastic. gods and kings is a wonderful compliment to the game, it makes it feel more complete (by adjusting the battle system to be more multi-turn, for example) and the aspect of faith factored into the gameplay adds a fun new twist. the extra maps and nations added by the other dlc also makes the game feel very vast, but wonderful. brave new world adds a whole other side of the game, and i found to be delightfully challenging. and if you dont like the dlc, you can even turn it off in-game. the only downside is the loading time, this game takes forever to load. other than that, i have no complaints. i highly recommend this game. you can trust me, ive played 115 hours of it.",146.6
"start a game and you can forget about being productive for the next couple of days.",10.9

"this game is always fun, it takes your time so easily and makes you want to play forever. caution, this game can make you addict as hell once you start a game.",87.8
"by far my favorite civ game. this is a great addition to the franchise and i highly reccomend it to any fans of this series or any other strategy type games, turn based or not. best game purchase i have made in the last couple of years.",153.4
"ever want to kick ghandis ? well now you can in this extreme game. what about making bismarck look like a sissy? hell what am i saying? you can make them all look like sissies!!! endorsed by the extreme reviews association. era",631.9
"this is a great game for those who are newcomers to strategy games and those who are either familiar to civilization or strategy games in general. its simple and easy to understand but good enough as both an introduction and continuation to playing strategy games. i highly recommend it on its own but even more so if you buy the brave new world expansion.",539.4
"i find it hard to believe anyone is really reading reviews for this, as this is one of those games that i feel you either are already intimately familiar with, or want nothing to do with. that being said, if you are into strategy games and have never played this, i would advise you to get this the next time steam throws it on sale. if strategy is not your thing...dont.",141.3
"aside from getting nuked by gandhi and getting indoctrinated by the rambo enemy missionaries, this game is more than worth its money.if you dig strategy games and have plenty of time on your hands to build your own empire from scratch on a world stage, then this is for you. only real complaint are the prices on the dlc-s, but thats just my opinion. 9.5/10",249.8
"never played any civ game. tried today and dindt stop playing for 4 hours straight.the singleplayer its a very low pace game (at least i think it is), and i think thats great because it gives you time to learn the game. you should try it.",25.5
"this is the best strategic game that i ever played :) . and be carefull u can forget how is outside youre house .",20.9
"i would highly recomend this game to any person mainly. i have spent many hours playing with friends exploring the brave new world expansion including world congress and religion. me and my friends very much enjoy this expansionas it adds so many new features to the game. highly recomend. once bought just sign your life away. youll love it.",41.6
"this is a wonderful installment to the civilisation franchise ive played civ iv and this to me is a big step up in graphics and depth of play and i love the expansitions mostly the bnw because for the 98 i played the civ brave new world i felt the connection that i had to that game. i would happily keep buying games like these and even more from civ",80.1
"what a great game. i plan to play this for many many hours.",98.8
"if you buy this, get the $80 bundle. includes everything you need. otherwise if you buy the base game, youll find you need to fork out another $50 to make the game good.",233.7
"civilization v is slowly taking my social life away but im fine with that, i got my friends to buy it so theres no need for me to leave the house anymore. i highly reccomend this game, its well worth it to buy the expansions.",190.6
"just.one.more.turn.the workers need you.they look up to you. the king of 4x games.",28.2
"holy  this game is addictive. being persia and nuking berlin and wiping out entire civilizations. i couldnt get into it at first, but  me i cant stop.",78.7
"very fun, but not sure about the mechanics, and games take a very long time; which i guess is good :)",22.4
"they make it easy to mod the game with built in search tools to browse mods guess that is why i have 600+ hours logged in... 750 hours and counting and with the expansions it is like a whole new game",789.7
"this game to me is great fun, but you have to be into the style of game to enjoy it, if you like civ revolution, then you should enjoy this, there are flaws with the game mechanics, especially in multiplayer, main issue for me is a graphic glitch that cause the graphics to trip out, forcing me to restart, also direct x isnt a great engine, so glitches like this are expected. but on a whole the game is alot of fun, but more enjoyable with friends.",175.3
"such a fun game. i enjoyed every hour i played its really in depth and theres alot of strategy that goes into it. overall 10/10",224.2
"make sure you have plenty of free time because this game just eats it up.",159.7
"this is one of the most addicting games i have played in a long time. the dlc really changes up gameplay and isnt just new character/map content.",187.7
"after many hours of play i can say this game ruined my life.",130.5
"if you have even looked at this game and considered hm, looks kind of neat. then you should buy the complete edition right now. gods and kings expansion is optional brave new world is extremely good and pretty much required to make this game a 10/10 the complete edition is highly suggested. theres far too much about this game for me to ramble on about. if you need more information go look up multiple reviews that arent from steam or one source. however, you can trust me when i say, unless you absolutely hate the grand strategy genre civ5 complete edition is a must buy, especially when its on sale.",161.5
"great game!! play this game 24/7 and is the most fun ive had in a game, especially on multiplayer!",208.1
"dominated the world as ethiopia with banana exports through the roof 10/10",79.2
"civ 5 is a great buy for nearly any gamer, have had a ton of fun with it! 9/10",232.8
"played probably thousands of hours of civ iv, i liked the interface better than 5, and i like the troop stacking better, and non-hexagonal movement style. but i would say, that civ v is still civ, and based on the same concept, but the little tweaks in this engine make it a more subtle, and political game, more than a bongo go stack, and smash kind of game. the concept is the same, but the style and thought process hasd definately changed. i have a feeling the community is going to lose some of the smash and grab players, but gain some more finesse players. all in all i think its a welcome addition to the series.",100.5
"have you ever wanted to become king? an emperor? a dictador? or even a god? the this is the game for you. you lay the foundation of your empire and you shape it just the way you like. do you want to be a powerhungry, moneygrabbing dictator? you can do that. or do you want to create a peace loving empire build on liberty and justice for all. you can do that. or do you simply want the chance for your country to rise to power and take revenge on those who wronged you? you can absolutely do that. all in all this game is amazing and the petty price for this game is highly worth it compared to the hundreds of hours you probably will put into it.",426.7
"this game is amazing. nothing else needs to be said.",412.6
"besides civ:4 this is the best grand strategy game of all time highly reccomened to any fan of grand strategy, politics or boardgames",56.5
"have too much free time that you want to inexplicably disappear? this is the game for you!",106.7
"very well done, best civ i have played, 81 hours in and still rocking",100.2
"fantastic game. its a perfect mix of medieval/stone age strategy and modern/futuristic strategy. its a very well made game. anyone that likes strategy will like this game. its easy to learn but hard to master.",46.1

"great replay value :d currently very cheap on humble bundle!! get it! thats all.",548.8
"this is probably the best strategy game ever. if you like strategy games, you should, no, you must buy this. its fun and very, very addicting.",212.4
"ive invested alot of time into this game worth it yes it has alot of different play styles and other civs especially on harder difficultys one of my top 5 games only thing i could put down about this is some of the starts are awfull and the crash bug i experience after around 80-85 turns of playing overall good :)",154.2
"8/10. great game that will suck the life out of you until you know everything about the roman empire. ai is wonky at times, but is almost always a fun experience.",276.5
"hands down on of the most effective turn-based games ive played in a long time. only downside is in large player matches...fighting against other people eats up a serious amount of time.",262.4
"this is by far one of my most favorite games ive ever played. every single game is vastly different with so many variables to account for that it makes it a very complex and stimulating game to play. with that being said it is also relatively easy to learn with the varied difficulty levels accomodating all levels of players. being able to see and learn about various things in world history while shaping your own version of it makes this game that much better. i cant wait to see what they do for civ 6.",741.4
"well wicked. got it on the cheap on humble bundle tho lol.",164.2

"this a great game to play with your friends. its a vary compitive game and makes you think about hard problems. this is single player or mutiplayer",108.7
"the vanilla version of this game offers a pretty solid base game, the game settings lets you spice up every new playthrough, which gives a really great replaying value. the ai is hard to please but its nothing that you wont be able to handle on your second playthrough. the expansions themselves enrich the game, offering a lot of diversity on how you want to win, plus, with both expansions you can access a variety of free community content (maps, civs, buffs and nerfs for certain gameplay aspects,etc). if youre looking to kill time this is one of the best games out there to do it.",776.2
"good game, get ready for pressing the turn over button at then press it again and suddenly you realize its been 4-6 hours since you first pressed for your turn to be over. i like the music and the narrator in iv better but the hex rule is better.",176.8

"this game can be summed up in one phrase: one more turn! so addictive that this one quote will be repeated so many times you wont even notice. awesome graphics, animations and soundtrack and one of the few games that not only welcomes but encourages the use of mods, adding massive amounts of gameplay to a game that already can give hundreds of hours of entertainment on its own.",307.7
"i played for many years the civ 3 , but civ 5 is the best of the series in my opinion!!!",4.0
"civilization v is an unparalleled 4x strategy game with many great systems contributing to an amazing experience. the randomly generated map and many different play styles ensure unique experiences every time you play. the social policy trees further distinguish each game you play in it from the others with many different combinations. contributing even further to this uniqueness is the sheer number of civilizations each with its own unique ability. a final factor contributing to its impressive variety is the many different victories players can go for. one of the few cons in this game i have to say is its addictiveness, it is nearly impossible to stop a game before you finish it.",574.1

"i dont think there has been a minute in this game that i havent loved.",298.0
"incredibly more-ish, and definitely worthy of just one more turn tag. word of warning, if theres something you need to do in an hour (or whatever) and your looking for something to waste some time until then, dont play this game, ill guarantee that you will lose track of time. otherwise i would highly recommend it. oh and do the tutorial if your new to this game, or else youll find yourself struggling a bit to figure out all the different mechanics and such.",53.4

"civilization v has given me a new hope for strategy games. as a person who has had little experience with previous civ games, i can say that it was still easy to pick up and roll with. all-in-all, the game isnt complex, but has many complexities working within it. from happiness of your citizens, to the amount of gold your making, everything you do is an important decision. i liked the idea of spying on other civs while protecting yourself from other civs spies. this game will give you a new patience for movement and decision making when trying to make your civilization dominant.",29.0

"like minecraft, except completely different. reminds me of civilization v.",88.7
"civilization v is an amazing game, i would totally think about getting it! gods and kings adds some more content but brave new world is a game changer! some of the negative traits are obviously the price of the game, its going to leave a hole in your pocket. 9/10",117.4

"mediocre game, with the first dlc (gods & kings) its alright, and with the second one (brave new world) its goty material. surely worth a buy if you like the civilization series. would be better if it werent for the million dlcs that make the game great.",109.8
"kinda slow at first but once you get into it is alot of fun",39.0
"the biggest time drain since taking a dump. youll pop in for a quick match then be playing the same match for the next 32 hours. during the time you will love and cry and finally achieve victory. you will stand victorious above all the nations you crushed on your way here and you will stop and think i could do this. then your political carreer begins. vote drtuv 2020",106.5

"456 hrs played, all single player. this is the best refined civ game ive played. this versions ui is the best by far. it is a great game to pass some time and build an empire. the main weakness of civ v is the ai. none of them follow the personality of their historical counterparts. they all have basically the same personality: psychopath. nothing like having ghandi break an alliance and declare war on you. but all in all, its a game i have played a lot and continue to come back to.",622.5

"a deep, wonderfully complex (but not everly so) tbs. many different ways to play, many variations of civs. the dlcs add so much more to the game play, they are well worth it to get. if you have the time to get into this, i would recommend it.",108.1

"as someone who is no fan of the other civ games, i went into this with no expectations for enjoyment. i was so wrong! great game and with gods and brave new world it is fully featured to make even the critics enjoy it. just one warning. do not start a game at night, you will not be going to bed if you do!",93.3

"its very similar to its predecessors, but with many new leaders to choose from, not to mention the multitude of add ons you can install with the steam workshop. has visually stunning graphics, if your pc can handle it. if it cant (like my pc), however, there is no need to panic, as there are two modes that you can play on which sets it apart from its predecessors: normal mode (which is with all the graphics) and strategy mode (allows you to view things with more simplicity, reducing an immense amount of lag). i have snapshots of both of these modes.",94.1
"this game never gets old. i never truly stop playing this game. i only take breaks in between the addiction. this is one of the best strategy games in my generation with an endless replayability. its simple enough for people new to the genre and complex enough for the people who really know what theyre doing to have a challenge. every time i play i pick a different nation, each one is compelling and i try to adapt the way i play to the civilizations strengths. ...just one more turn.",804.7
"10/10. a true mark in the civ franchise. it has no nuke limit.",90.4
"just dont play it in the night if you value your sleep or have things to do...",126.4

"they should have sent a poet. all i can say is this is the easiest way to lose an entire day.",16.9
"one of the best games in the world!!! cant wait until civilization: beyond earth",35.4
"this is the greatest civilization game to date. granted there is bugs and the multiplayer can be unstable at times but it is easily fixable with a reload. brave new world, the latest dlc as of this recommendation fixes all the above-mentioned issues quite well!",195.2
"one of the best games ive ever played. immersive, intelligent and informative on a historical level. also one of the most life-destroying games ive ever played. at any moment you could find yourself wondering where hours of your life went. a great distraction.",66.7

"it is addictive, the music is great, the tension in every victory feels well balanced, combat diversifies in a very satisfying manner, and the game itself has a sense of grandeur i love.",343.4
"beautiful. if you love strategy and tactical games, buy this now.",114.2
"a really good game that is hindered by some big issues. go play iv or iii, wait until they have worked out the kinks in the next installment. simple as that, i like a lot of the additions, especially hexes, but the game still needs a lot of work.",71.1
"very addictive, easy to jump into, great replay value. needs the expansions for the best gameplay.",38.9
"it gets hetic and so much back stabbing u will wonder if ya own mother is trying 2 stab u. the mulitplayer is hella fun but can drag. the political and different methods of victory are pretty sweet.",116.1
"while not as great as their previous games its still a worthy time sink. good for those who want a heafty civ taste but at the same time dont want to dump 5 days into 1 civ run",202.6
"a turn based strategy game that needs a lot of time invested in it before you see just how much fun it can be to play. im not totally convinced its better than its previous versions or that the pacing is right. still the game has loads of mods available for it that can change the whole dynamic of the game so its potential for replayability is not in doubt. an absolute must have to any strategy addicts games library",258.3
"one of the best games ive ever played. such addictive one more turn gameplay. everybody needs to try this at least once.",497.3
"this game is addictive, amazing, and i hate it so much.",327.0

"shiity game i clock in 100+ hours of game play, but u know what i cant play it now dun know wtf going on with it. check online alot of people same as me cant get it to start after seleting directx.",298.3
"very fun game. it is different from civ iv but overall i like the change to hex grid tiles the most. the combat is also more strategic and entertaining since you can only have one unit per tile. the gods and kings expansion should only make this game better.",128.9
"its horrible, it ruined my life, it sucks. 10/10 would definetly recommend.",41.7
"if i had to live on a couple of games for the rest of my life, civ 5 would be one of them.",43.6
"very rarely does a turn-based strategy game appeal to me, but damn, i cant get enough of this game.",25.8
"best strategy game ive played to this day, its mostly strategy, if you dont have a mind for strategy i suggest you dont buy the game then...",197.3
"this game is perfect for the someone who hates the outdoors, free time and other people. buy this game and those three things will be distant memories. just remember to eat and sleep. luckily thanks to the games turn based nature and continuing memory leaks you can most likely do both between turns. this game is the equivalent of digital heroin. go watch the movie train spotting and if that kind of lifestyle appeals to you buy this game.",427.3
"really nice game if you have time to play it ... just one more turn... and more enjoyable with a group of friends",88.8
"great game. every match is completely different and unpredictable.",176.7
"having started my civ experience with sid meiers alpha centauri back in the early 2000s, i can say that coming to this game after playing that shows a huge improvement in many features, but a loss in many others. one thing i seriously hope for in beyond earth is a return for the unit customization. please.",123.6
"25h on record, almost finished my first game! thats some value there.",27.9

"great game, will take over your life! very easy to learn for beginners too.",34.2
"say goodbye to your social life and/or your sleep.",363.6
"fantastic game. never played the genre before this. had a slight learning curve, but i found it easy to move up in the difficulty rankings until i settled in on immortal. recently added gods and kings and brave new world. feels like a brand new game and added a lot more depth.",687.2
"very enjoyable with friends. the base game is alright, but i think that despite the expense of the dlc, it dramatically adds to the fun.",110.5
"best empire strategy gmae i have ever played. good with computers, and better with people.",209.6
"you will lose waaaay too many hours of your life playing this game.",178.4
"best strategy game on steam. recommend to everyone who loves a turn based strategy game with tons of content and endless replayability.",462.0
"a short review isnt going to cover the complexity and richness of this game, but then again: if you are attracted to those aspects in a game you would have tried this strategy game icon by now. a short review: if you like shooting, racing and football much more than strategy you probably will find this game too much. if you like to go in depth in each and every game you play you will love this like i do.",477.6

"the ai is constantly trying to stab you in the back and barbarians can have the most cutting edge weaponry on the planet. 10/10.",69.0
"for all that is holy, consider yourself warned. this game takes a few hours of procrastination and turns it into a life-changing experience. you will lose your job, your family and your house. but who cares? the game takes place in real time, meaning that when you complete one game, it will actually be the year 2050 outside. can get a little bit tedious when youre waiting for the next turn, so prepare a small crate of beers.",134.4
"its an alright game...multiplayer could be better?",187.5

"great game, worth every penny. it may seem complex but once you get the hang of it, it will become one of the best strategy games, in my opinion.",185.1
"the game is fun to play, although games do take a while to complete. better if played over a couple days or even weeks rather than all at once.",204.5
"this game is one of the most fun games i have ever played in my entire life and its even more fun with friends. i absolutly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a fun game. also it gets even better when you get the dlc.",9.7

"very good, but does tend to slow down on huge maps.",799.3
"awesome game, great turnbased combat. love the different victories and variety of civs and leaders you can play. great time sink, which is to say that this game will take hours to get through one playthrough. but you can save and whatnot so why not? yall just gotta go rambo style and play mongolia ya dig?",122.7
"great game! needs some work with online play, but other then that pretty good. best strategy game out there",238.1
"trust me when i say that this game will make you play until its 2 am, its that fun. if you want to play a turn-based-stratigic game that grows in time when you play it longer, this game is for you! if you want to play as a japanese warlord, this game is for you! if you want to destroy all nations in your way wihtout feeling guilty about it, this game is for you! (also it has giant robots of death. dont belive me? play the game and youll see.)",48.0
"i really wouldnt suggest buying any of these games, theres no real room for dipolomacy or anything and the ai will freak out at the slightest hint of something they dont like. although the brave new world expansion fixes a  ton of the issues. so, yeah....kinda worth it now.",253.1
"dont get this game. hours, literal hours will fly by before youve noticed. i dont even know if this game is fun - all i know is that half of my day dissapeared and i wasnt aware of time passing. there is something sinister about this game..",35.2

"this game makes me too paranoid to function. i love it.",126.9
"bought this game back in 2012. almost three years later and i still love playing this game. i dont think ive put more time in any other game, and ive been gaming since i was a kid. phenomenal depth, easy to learn, theres not much to hate about this game. however, if you do buy it, make sure you buy the expansion packs, gods & kings and brave new world, they make the game so much better than its original version. and the original was pretty good to begin with,",390.6
"if you love empire-building games and turn-based combat games, youll love this game. its an all-around improvement on the previous civ games, and they seem to get better with every new version of the series. the only thing i dont like about civ v is that i cant combine my troops into an army (which was a feature in a previous installment of the franchise). i hope the next version offers the option again.",40.7
"one of the most fun games i have played in a long time, but be warned! you will get hooked like an addict on gaming crack, and there are so many mods that enhance the game, even when you feel like youre done with the standard campaign (and thats without even mentioning the awesome multiplayer) :d would definitely recommend! 10/10",242.0
"so addictive (40 hrs in 5 days?!?!?), yet it lets you set your own pace because its turn-based strategy. i prefer this to rts games like aoe 3.",94.6
"started to play thinking, well i got them all pretty much in that humble bundle, might as well try it a bit, ive heard some good things about it. 7 hours later it crashes and i look at how long i played and after 7 hours of utter immersion and amazing fun. defenitely one of the best games ive played thats been developed within the last year or so.",43.2
"want time to suddenly fly out of your grasp? looking for a game that will suck away your soul? this is the game for you! (seriously, i lose my life ten hours at a time. this is both awesome and horrifying. buy now.)",470.7
"this game is fun with expansions and well made but very poorly programmed, the multiplayer online barely works for anyone yet they do nothing to fix it, the game crashes often for everyone i know and has not improved that since its launch, and for many i know it will take anywhere from a minute and a half to even ten minute to even launch, often for many it will not launch at all yet the game still costs a good deal of money and does nothing to fix these problems. please go find another game, even the previous civ ran far better than this, this game is not worth your money, there are plenty of better options.",23.4

"if you liked the civ series, youre going to love this. pair it with brave new world and it will be even better. enjoy winning a campaign by playing like a dalek to get the exterminate! exterminate! achievement, by playing like a politician to win the diplomatic victory (meh), by playing like a pop artist to win a cultural victory, or by playing like my brother to default into (attempting to) winning by points at year 2050.",77.2

"from the dawn of mankind, from the point where humans finally band together to create societies, you the player take control of a variety of nations that have actually existed in history, such as china, america, england, russia, germany, and japan to name a few, to write your own version of history alongside other great nations of the earth. researching technologies, adopting social policies, building cities, conquering other empires, these are just some of the powerful decisions and abilities you are able to wield as the leader of your people. you will watch the ascension of your meek, primitive people into what you aspire it to be. a powerful military empire? a technologically advanced society? a flourishing nation of arts and culture? will you be a tyrant? a philosopher? a diplomat? as the narrator states before each match, can you build a civilization to stand the test of time?",1084.2

"a true classic for all strategy lovers. ive never seen a game so complex and amazing looking. the movements are smooth but later in game the game start to slowly get an fps drop due to the vast amount of units. i guess that is natural, as most games would fail to get that right as well. the ai is smart, difficulty is at the right level to what you choose... maybe a little too good.",275.0

"time flies as one heads up one great civilization after another. for an old-school civ-player, all this religion and diplomacy malarkey can get a bit hectic and feels a bit foreign at first, but it definitively adds to the atmosphere of the game. it is a well-balanced turn-based strategy game with an incredible amount of content. i have only managed to win at king once and it took some thinking in the end-game. success is not always guaranteed, but a few setbacks along the way arent necessarily fatal. recommended for anyone with a fair bit of spare time on their hands. its addictive nature rarely allows for just a quick five minutes... type of play, but that is part of its timeless charm.",154.5

"i bought this game and played a match. its been 15 hours so far.",20.9
"i recommend this game on its own merits, having not played much by way of the other civilization games. however, civ 5 works really well for me and i thoroughly enjoy it. good systems and mechanics for tile improvements, city building and improving them, etc. with each expansion it fleshes out more and adds new systems to enjoy and explore. basically, if you like strategy games, this one will give you a lot to see and do, and its pretty damn enjoyable while doing it.",498.9
"if you are looking for a game to spend hours upon hours playing and not even realize it, this is the game for you. visually its stunning and its a ton of fun to play. war is tactical, no longer stack attack until you win and city/empire management is wonderful. 5star in my opinion :)",228.2
"as good as the previous civilizations, with added tabletop like stradegy & format giving it a better feel, flow, playstyle and better graphics to boot.",584.7
"this was my first real civ game, and i love it. the brave new world expansion adds a lot of complexity and a lot of interesting elements to keep the game interesting. ive definitely sunk way too many hours into this game, but its one of my favorite games to binge on. the game takes a lot of time to play, but because it is turn based, you can (supposedly) save at any time and play more later. i enjoy this game for more than just the style of game. i appreciate the historical information woven into the game, and i like that i can play this game while listening to or watching something else. if you like slow, tactical games, i would recommend giving civilization v a try.",344.3
"this game is one of the best games that i have played. i deffinately reccomend it especially if you love stratigy. i love to play this because i love stratigy (without stratigy i would be a mindless thug playing call of duty no offence). me and my friend think it would be the perfect game to play for geography in school because it has some geological stuff in it (dont steal this idea or unless you put my name in for example thank you ethan/behemoth for suggesting this). deffinately play it and maybe even challenge me if you dare and yea. recap deffinately play it challenge me if you want and watch my youtube (soon going to be uploading civilizations once i fix my recorder)",32.1

"today is civ 5 the best turn-based strategy on the market. especially when you have both major dlcs - gods & kings and brave new world. it has literally everything - epic battles, diplomatic schemes, spying, relgious conflicts, exploring never the same maps and the right feeling that you are the real emperor leading your nation to the greatness.",428.6
"i started playing civ 3, i do enjoy this game much more with the personalities of other kings/queens of empires. the addition of religion gives it a fresh new twist, while the graphics are very good for its title. lots of customizable features to help you explore the game constantly anew.",27.7
"the game where one more turn leads to hours of gameplay. first playthrough took ten hours. you wont get bored, guaranteed.",29.0
"this is the most addictive game ive ever played. the relationship you have with other civs is complex and rewarding to those who try to be a good diplomat. unfortunately, civs sometimes do things randomly and ruin relations with other civs because of it. the game demands for planning and careful thought for each turn. this is not a fast pace game. it is for those who like to micro-manage and work best at a slow pace. future plans for your empire and war with another will always have you chanting just one more turn.",312.1

"ahhh, good old civ v. if you have time to spare, get this brilliant masterpiece! cunning diplomacy and evil strategies are at your fingertips. conquer the world? or be the cultural genius? its up to you!",43.1
"good enough to be called a civilization sequel, combat has changed to a strategical-tactical-like kind, culture victories/small empires are more viable, along with city-states for diplomacy-based games. the only real bad thing is the ai, which must make up for poor play with cheats, discounts or starting advantages as you play a higher difficulty.",118.0
"i have a problem with lusting over global domination. thats why i play a lot of 4x games (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate). and civ 5 is a pretty (visually speaking) fix for that problem of mine.",57.2
"great game! lots of fun. never can stop playing after starting a new game! must get!",183.7
"civ 5 is awesome. i sink hooooours into this without realising. just be aware that it handles diplomacy like an idiot.",538.2
"bland at best, the combat system is still a joke, diplomacy is laughable, the ai is not able to compromise or reason. the upgrade system for units is annoying, you also cant view how your city really looks like anymore. the computer players also get massive fake resources to compensate for a lack of development and thought. meaning all cities you conquer will generally be trash, beat the game once then never play it again or just save your money and time.",45.4
"pretty entertaining for a few hours but often gets a bit boring, overall i like owning kingdoms <3",2.7
"never have i played a game in which just one more move... means 3 hours worth of gameplay (and waking up horribly late for work the next day). its a good strategy game, just dont let gandhi get nukes....never let that skinny freak have nukes.... gandhi. buy this game and kill gandhi today :d",71.3
"one of the last, yet still great of a dying genre the rts. if you can afford it definitely pick this up, and dont forget to check out the expansions, which may not seem all that important until youve tried playing without them. they work as though they were always in the game and only further immerse your experience.",241.7
"too much fun, but when i stop playing i realize ive played an 8 hour session",181.7
"the fifth installment adds some interesting changes to this legendary turn-based strategy series. probably the most significant (or at least most-noticed) change is that armies can no longer be stacked on top of each other, which requires completely new strategies, especially since cities can shoot at enemies seprately from any troops that might be stationed there.",222.5

"sid meiers civ v is a must own game. personally, i would have never seen myself playing this game. but i bought it on sale one day and i can say its one of my top games. its a fun, well made, and all around enjoyable game. the different civilazations create a different game every time you start one up. the variety is really really relaxing as you dont feel a grind, or a sense of repetition. the gameplay it self is awesome. turn based game with lots of things happening at once. you build up your civ. and your battle it out with other civs, or you may go a passive route and win economically or culturally. plus there is awesome online play which make it really fun to battle it out versus friends or team up with friends and fight other ai or users. must have!",145.1
"11 hour games... just did 3 in a row. loved every second of it. wtffff this game too addicting",180.1
"very fun, but not a game you just play for 15 minutes.",26.8
"first off: this game is really fun. its easy to setup a game that will take you 45 mins or one that will last you several days. the graphics and sounds are very well done, and the unique civilizations are interesting enough to try out different strategies. however... the game doesnt seem as deep now; diplomacy and technology are now pretty shallow. do not get me wrong, you will get your moneys worth because--like any civ game--the replayability is staggering and they are releasing patches every 6-10 weeks to help out with balance and ai. you may want to wait for a sale to get all the dlcs since they are a bit pricey. if you want to change the original game, just visit the built-in mod browser and download something popular. the modding community is very active and will probably support this game for a few years to come.",388.8
"this long standing thinking mans game about building up your very own civilization from the b.c. era to modern times plays like an advance form of risk.",21.3
"this is a solid upgrade over earlier versions of civilization ive played. the cultural victory seems to be the easiest for most leaders to achieve. the game definitely makes you be active though. there is always one or two key resources that are in short supply around the world that you have to go out and find. some leaders play very different - kamehamaha for example who can embark on oceans right away. others, like ramses maybe not so much. there is more difference in how they act during the game than how they work when you play them, i think. but the differing skill levels and boards can keep changing the game dynamics - as can luck of the draw. there always seems to be some very crowded areas which force people to go to war and then one or two civilizations who are off sort of on their own with lots of room to grow. definitely worth playing around with and trying out different approaches.",231.9
"toss up between civ v and civ iv for best in series, but definitely a close match. a lot depends on preferences. this one is definitely more streamlined and probably easier for a newcomer though.",247.0
"best turn based strategy game series ever. go buy it and then experience one more turn syndrome for yourself",152.4
"if the fact i already have 300+ hours isnt a good enough recommendation, then i dont know what is. great game, and the satisfaction of beating deity is almost second to none.",296.3
"its a good game overall. interesting and can be fun if you like history or turn-based strategy games. the leaders scene are quite impressive and improve from the previous civilization games. also, with the new dlc, this game sure is going to be a lot more fun! a recommmended game to everyone who likes to learn history, spend their free time or even just for fun. :)",58.7
"time consumer deluxe. have too much spare time? no problem!",25.8

"just one more turn. what do yo mean its been 3 days since i sat down to play?",156.9
"exceptionally well designed gameplay, one of the most beautiful soundtracks ever composed and all that multiplayer supported. you like strategic board games and complex econemy systems? then this game is a must buy for you!",23.1
"an incredibly addictive and massively fun strategy game thats great for passing the time and easily accessible for those not particularly used to playing strategy games.",380.2
"the type of game that can suck you for hours as soon as you pick it up... 5/5",48.9
"if you are a civilizatoin fan this new installment is a must have. great graphics, new units, new civics to use, and much more.",171.7
"this games is fantastic and amazing. enough said. now buy it.",16.3
"awesome stuff. its a great game but it only shows its real potential when you have all the expansion set.",243.3
"civilization v is perfect installment for civilization franchise, good gameplay; a.i. little too agressive, but when you get used to it, youll start to like this game. bad sides of this game is, that when you buy civilization v, then buy gold edition, because youll save money and get so many expansions.",33.6
"this game has made me look at history class so diffrently. when my teacher says an important land mark i pretty much have already heard of it or know about it! it also shows the armies of each nation very histoically accurate. i would defientntly recommend this game for anyone!",59.8
"a good, updated version of the classic with some exceptional new features. still a lot of fun in single player, but my friends and i love the multiplayer.",604.2
"imho, nowhere near as good as civ 4 and the 2 expansions are highly recommended. much easier than every other edition in the civ series. theyve done a decent job patching out issues created by the changes. infinite city sprawl seems to be a bit less effective than it was at release.",204.0
"great game, especially with brave new world. one of the best turn based strategy games out there.",150.0
"you too can learn of the might and the fury of a gandhi enraged.",548.1
"the all-time champion of strategy games. though not its most complex entry, the best balance of complexity and speed.",411.5
"i only started playing this genre with civ iv. i really liked it. civ v is a whole new challenge with familiar surroundings. religion and espionage are ok, id like it if yo could have your spy sabotage or do more even if youve out researched your oppenent. its a good game and quite enjoyable playing againt/with friedns.",928.0
"really a great, fatastic game.but it would be better if there was auto save. andif there is someone tell me i cant seem to find it.",49.3
"have played none of the previous civilization games, i didnt expect to get a whole lot out of this title... but i was very wrong! the turns move quickly, the game is easy to get into, and the maps are fun to explore. plus, its fun to play co-op with friends against the ai!",82.0
"the most accurate part of this game is that ghandi always but always nukes you. i really think this aspect add realisim on top of the fact that atilla wins a cultural victory.",140.1
"this has been eating my brain for days. got it through humble bundle and am loving it.",404.0
"so many hours have been devoted to this black hole of a game. i regret none of them.",150.0

"just one more turn will always last another 3 hours. great game.",59.2
"this may be the single greatest game ever, from its awesomeness, to its epicness, it makes you suck a  and like it.",131.2
"a really good game for people who love strategy games",59.6
"best in the franchise, best in its genre. civilization v is one of my favourites games ever made. its biggest issue is how addictive it is. but hey, they say that time enjoyed is not time wasted, right? 10/10",222.5
"a good improvement on civ iv (in my opinion a lowpoint of the series). still suffers from the typical civ end-game where every turn takes a very long time. the religion and trading systems are expanded upon in the dlc (brave new world), which add a new dimension to the game - trade is essential to stay afloat in the early game. a wide choice of countries and leaders and the hex tile system also add to the game. i wouldnt pay $50 for the dlc packs - they arent a whole new game.",31.9
"i highly reccomend this game its the best game on steam",619.2
"this is the ultimate civilization game in the best turn based game series!",506.8
"a very good game, with hundreds of mods at your disposal you can play the game for hours days, weeks even. i, myself , logged close to a thousand hours of gametime to this game. probably one of the best strategy games out there.",1070.3
"a worthy successor to the venerable civilization franchise. still at the top of the familys list of pasttimes.",303.0
"great game, expect to forget what the sun looks during the 2-3 weeks after you buy this game",212.0
"wasnt really my favorite but if you like the series then this game will keep you up at night and will enjoy it(until the point when you die).",3.7
"with the new gods and kings expac, this game is taken from a mediocre entry into the hallowed series to a game worthy of being a civ game.",309.5
"its a good game even though it uses the usual firaxis strategy (make an ok game then sell the dlcs that make it much better for almost full price, for example the new xcom) the only expansion you want is brave new world",0.9
"one of my favrioute ever games absouloutley brilliant multiplayer and singleplayer reallly great worth buying",188.7
"civilization v is a very tactical game filled with fun and excitment as you take your turn. i suggest any of you who are a fan of strategy games or conquering things :3 i give it a good 9.5/10",81.6
"im near the end. ill just finish this game and go to bed, you say. you lift your eyes to the clock a moment later and its 4:30a.m. and your civilization hasnt even discovered the internet.",84.2
"is your  between 0 and 12 inches? get this game and be 13inches+",419.2
"deep down, its really not a different game from the pixelly dos one i used to play late into the night, very badly, way back when. still simple enough for a kid with plenty of depth, a decent learning curve and enough variety to keep you entertained for years. the multiplayer definitely needs some work, still buggy and cant be modded, but single player still has plenty of depth to go around.",245.3
"grab a 30 rack or 3, sit down with a few friends, and lan this game all day long. most fun ive hd sitting in one place for 16 straight hours.",157.8
"best civilization yet! combines old civilization with civ revolution to make the best of both worlds. highly recommend!",10.2
"i would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games.",231.4
"i cannot even begin to describe how good this game is. download the demo and see for yourself. i played the demo many times through before i bought the game.",98.5
"very deep game with a ton of replayability. you are the ruler of a nation and you must build it up from the stone age to the space age and everything in between. absolutely recommended!",396.8
"a really fun, easy going, not hard but still complex strategy.",398.3
"great game, hours of fun. can definitly eat up a day. always remember, just one more turn...",56.7
"learn agriculture, culture, dynasties, economics, governments, trade, and warfare. civilization v gives you an adventure from the past to modern world. highly recommended.",63.4
"screw this game. its too addicting. i go play this game thinking ill just spend a few hours on friday night playing this game. next thing i know, its sunday night not knowing where the hell did my weekend go. its a game where you say to yourself one more move... turns to two hundred more moves and six hours later. i literally started this game at 7pm and next thing i knew, it is 5am and only had 1 hour of sleep until i had to get ready for work. btw, screw ghandi. do not make peace with him. he will always make war with you.",13.9
"awsome, but could be improved upon. endless space is better",240.2
"many hours canbe spent in this one, waiting on loading mostly;(",541.5
"this game is amazing. it might seem as if each time you play its going to be the same but no matter what the game will always be diffrenet. the first day i got this game i played for 10 hours straight. this game is amazing. its like a board game but has so many more features.",70.6
"with the gods & kings expansion the game is nicely rounded out and i think a worthy civ title.",83.5
"if you are thinking of getting a strategy game for this sale, go with this. i would also recommend buying the standerd version then bnw cause bnw includes g and k and adds more too, so its just more bang for your buck. if u do get it msg me so we can play!",294.7
"some could say civilization v is the greatest turn based strategy games in years, i would agree. this game makes you think before you act and one wrong decision could cost you the game. for example you could opt for a full out military assualt on an empire that you think you outnumber or just have more technology then but after years and years of bloodshed you find yourself backed up against a wall with no one to save you, maybe you should of peaced out while you had the chance? maybe you shouldnt of started the war in the first place and went along your merry way. this is what civilization is all about, yes it might look simple on the outside or boring, but everyone who is a fan of turn based strategy games will understand how amazing this game really is. definitely reccomend",145.5
"i was expecting it to be way more complicated thanks quill18 for getting me into civ this ones fo you man",179.9
"slow and meticulous but draws you in. fun like risk with friends on a late saturday night.",7.2
"ive never been much of a strategy game person, but this and xcom: enemy unknown really changed that. this game is a little rough around the edges without the brave new world and gods & kings expansions. i highly recommend both of those to get an extremely complete and well rounded game. as the saying goes: one more turn. as you can see i have spent well over 700 hours on this game and i have enjoyed almost every moment of it. i always seems to fall back into and and just enjoy the game play. the game also has a very good amount of history you can learn from in just by reading the built-in wiki. i have since taken up an interest in history, just due to this game. there are just so many things i can write about this game, but i think the best thing i can really say is you should try it for yourself. i am sure you will enjoy it, especially if you are already into strategy games!",813.1
"best strategy simulator out there. the dlc makes brilliant changes to gameplay. highly recommended",200.1
"this game is so fun and addicting to play, it will take your hours away without you even thinking about it. defintely recommend picking it up.",79.7
"one of the best strategy, turn-based games ive played in a long time. conqour the world or win the hearts or awe of millions, you choose how you want to win this thing. the entire set-up works great because sometimes you have to rely on your enemies to get the job done, whatever it is that your doing. this is just for the base game alone; when you take into account gods and kings expansion, holy crap, this thing is the best ever. espionage and religion (only in gods and kings) add such an addictive game mechanic, youll never stop playing this. every single turn is a please...just one more turn then im done... crawl to the finish line, even if youve already gotten there.",64.7
"too busy playing this game to recommend it. just one more turn.",474.2
"any strategy game fan will find more than enough enjoyment in civilization 5. be sure to prepare yourself for sitting in front of your pc for hours on end.",58.0
"this game is awesome. although the game may seem complicated the game really helps you throughout the game with hints and recommendations, and it helps that the menu is easy to understand. the characters in the game are well done but are lacking dialouge. the graphics, surprisingly, are a very strong part of the game. the lasting appeal is endless as their is so many scenarios to play as, especially is you obtain the dlcs for the game. the ganplay is great and fun, and the ai is good and keeps the game interesting. building your own civilization from scratch and conquering the world is awesome 8.5/10- addictive and awesome",57.9
"awesome strategy game that really gets you thinking. i love the history,art,and thought put into this game. the game feels overall pretty well balanced civilizations and societal and political trees,few have game breaking advantages can be found as opposed to some rts. its a great game to sit back and play a week long game vs a few computers a few steps at a time with, or to go at it with friends and try to conquer the world. great visuals, music in these games isnt usually my thing. looking forward to grabbing the dlcs",15.4
"if you own the expansions (g&k and bnw), then this is one of the best and most accessible 4x games ever created. its lacking a certain something by itself, but the expansions on top make this a fantastic purchase that just takes massive bites out of you free time. without expansions: this is a great game to buy while on sale. with expansions: worth all of your time and money.",41.1
"probably the best game in the civ series, especially with the expansion packs adding additional content. the dlc also gives more options as to how you want to play - pretty much every aspect is customisable to your own playstyle. at no time does this game feel like a slog to play, as your civilisation moves through the ages different challenges and priorities appear for you to focus on.",245.2
"takes a long time to complete a playthrough but definatly offers more that you would have thought in terms of ways its possible to play. very entertaining to play i would recommend it to people who like risk, because of the way the map is set out/",88.4
"having been a civ addict since the original civilization release over 20 years ago i was initially disappointed with this release as the game did not appear to have the depth of other civ games, particularly civ 4. however the more i played this it became apparent that the game dynamics were far more intricate than i first percieved, offering challenges for both beginners and civ veterans. with 2 well planned expansions adding a level of depth that rivals, if not superceeding civ 4, i now rate this game as the best in the series. with nearly a 1000 hours of gameplay, ive probably invested more time in this game than any other game in my collection and it still offers exceptional replay value on the higher difficulty levels. i cant recommend this game highly enough, quite simply it is astounding!",1035.9
"4 **** i struggle to understand a lot of civs concepts but i can recognize a good game when i see it. this title has a lot going for it, its better than 4 in my opinion. so if you like this sort of thing give it a go.",75.2
"so. good. streamlined nicely for casual players, but fully capable of supporting advanced players. the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay immersive and guaranteed to make you keep uttering the phrase thats practically the series trademark: just one more turn until three in the morning. if youre at all interested in turn-based strategy youve just found its crown. play it.",239.7
"the one thing that the civilization series lacked, for me, was tactical combat. civ5 adds this new layer to the game, and the result is fantastic. unfortunately, the civ ai has never been formidable in warfare and, with this more complex war system, the flaws are more noticeable than ever. nonetheless, this game is extremely engaging and re-playable, a very easy recommendation.",333.9
"its the perfect mix of a strategy and casual. also i get to nuke people.",35.3
"amazing strategy game! definitely a must buy for any fan of the genre! hours if not days worth of gameplay in one match. worth anywhere between 15 to 25$",57.9
"this game eats all your time, but you will be so entertained in the process. a+",105.8
"prepare to lose all time. this game is a black-hole of awesome.",308.5
"its a trap! a digital purgatory from whence you may not escape. save yourself!",27.0
"by far the best of the civilization games, as an old civ 2 player i found civ 5 to have everything i missed in the old masterpiece. civ 5 delivers like civ 3 and 4 with their strange game builds never did. interesting battles, no more tech-stealing from city captures, government talent trees instead of simply chosing a government, etc. the tech-tree can seem a bit short though, and the ai make misstakes in battles, but a modifiable game pace and multiplayer solves those issues.",518.7
"this game is amazingly fun, just take breaks every 7 hours so you avoid a blood clot in your leg.",27.4
"the ole fall back game... its just good and always there :-)",85.5
"this game is tons of fun. it has a deep singleplayer that will keep you in your seat for hours. the multiplayer is a lot of fun when you play with your friends.",163.4
"7/10 civ 5 is a fun game but there are some bugs that needed to be fixed for a while which hurt this game so much.",335.4
"this game is amazing, more people need to play it. it is only fun if you are playing with friends, by yourself, it is boring.",230.4
"classic empire building game. timeline goes from the stone ages up until you colonize space. ive been playing some version of this game for 25 years (yikes). civ 5 looks good but is resource intense for some older computers. ive wasted a lot of my life playing this game.",312.6
"fun. unless brazil/aztecs/spain/england/mongolia/etc. then .",314.6
"im gonna flunk my degree because of this game. but still.",82.0
"i dont recommend this game at all. the ai is terrible in intelligence, and the difficulty levels are either incredibly too easy, or incredibly too difficult. there is no middle ground to really build your knowledge of the game easily. the diplomacy in the game is terrible, and their are not enough civs without shelling out more cash for dlc which unless you play the mods alot is total garbage. the only plus this game has to offer is the combat.",153.3
"fun and addictive game, not as difficult as you might think, get it!",40.5
"this is such an awsome straghty game! u should buy it!",201.7
"this is a very kick  game. i love it my battles can last four hours and still not finish.",149.8
"an amazing game that involves so many great features, with great dlc, community and mod support! i would strongly recommend this if anyone is thinking of buying it.",51.1
"the expansions are really what made this good game, great.",590.7
"amazing history game. they are spot on and everything they add allows for more culture, civilizations and religions to shine. amazing. probably my favorite strategy game.",307.2
"destroy all civilizations. rule the world. dominate all.",146.3
"after playing this games predecessor, civ iv, playing civilization v is different enough to warrant a new game, but similar enough to be part of the same franchise. like the previous iterations, you control a nation with the goal to bring it from its humble roots into a major power. unlike other games, war is not your only option. being a highly cultured nation or being the first to go to space are very viable options, especially if you plan for it. you can also win via diplomacy, but its not very viable in this game. a major change from civilization iv is that you cant stack units. whereas before, you could just bring a dozen units or so and take down an opponents city in a turn, battles now take time and planning as you surround a city and whittle its defenses. this change in mechanics brings interesting tactics into the game.",190.5
"amazing!!!! its the best strategy game i have ever played!",22.2
"an huge and epic piece of round based strategy. in this game you start of with an ancient civilzation and develop it further and further, until you reach the modern times or even the future. i personally find this game very addicting and lots of fun.",132.3
"intrigueing game, lots of options and the computer teams up on you for a beat down...great turn based game",68.8
"fantastic game. great visuals, smooth gameplay and most importantly, hours and hours of diverse gameplay. a must have.",388.4
"do u reallly have to ask why u should get this game its freaking awesome <3",784.5
"this game is the reason i find myself at 3 in the morning tired as hell saying just one more turn. one more then then i will go to bed. one of the main reasons i got my pc and steam in general.",168.7
"one of the great strategy classics, prepare to lose days of your life playing this game.",120.9
"make your own civilization. see it grow. conquer the world, colonize space, unite the world through peaceful ways, or leave your own cultural mark for the future of mankind. all in 7 hours. caution: enemy civilizations may wreak havoc. caution: may keep you glued to your seat for to long.",601.2
"the best part about brave new world is that its finally every victory condition is equal to another (i-e: busy time, difficulty to achieve), but also just as busy. also the changes in diplomacy allows a deeper game-play.",50.2
"do you like extremly slow paced empire building games that will suck days weeks months and even years of your life away? look no further. then look harder cause this damn game is still getting dlc packages to expand the gameplay it should have started with.",845.2
"an awesome experiance for new and experianced players. if you liked the idea of running a nation over history, but found the first 4 civilization games difficult to master, then you might find this one the easiest one to understand yet.",467.7
"if you love strategy and teaming up with your mates to build your empire and crush !!! your enemy i couldnt recommend a better game than this.",19.3
"being a big fan of civilization, i can proudly say that this may be the best entry in the series. going from sqaures to hexagons adds a new layer of strategy. a great games to challenge friends in. id recommend this to newbies or long time strategy player.",55.2
"this game is like the funnest thing evar !!! but no joke once someone declares war there is basically no way to stop playing until one of you is dead. i dont recommend playing this game if you have somehwere to go, because right when you want to stop gandhi nukes you, and you arent going to let that er live, even if you have something better to do.",78.8
"great strategy game,at its best when playing with other players.",528.5
"ever since i got this game, i have almost completly dedicated my life to it. countless hours have been spent building up a civilization, just to have it wiped out, so many games won and lost, civilizations rise and fall. i havent been able to do a single productive thing! this game is too adicting, i havent eaten for days, i cant even remember the last time i slept. i... i cant feel my legs anymore, it has been so long since i have moved. please, someone, anyone, i need help. this game, will be the end of me, tell my family... i lo... 10/10 i highly recommend this game.",151.5
"this game is such a time killer. make sure to get the gods and kings expansion if you plan on getting it. so buy the civ 5 gold edition. one more turn!! 9/10",62.7
"incredibly engrossing turn-based strategy game. you will sink a dozen hours in a single session if not wary.",109.3
"this game is another amazing one, i conquered the whole world :d",32.1
"a fantastic game! probably one of the best games since....... sliced bread!",219.7
"got civilization v as a gift from a friend, took me awhile to install and test it out however since doing so i havent been able to stop playing. not a huge fan of turn based strategy games however civilization is slowly starting to become one of my favorite games. i know i am late to the party but i would recommend it to anyone who likes simulation or strategy based games.",33.5
"played this game till 3am without realising the time. 10/10 will do again.",155.9
"a wonderful strategy game. a must recommend for everyone. remember to buy all expansions for best experience!",269.3
"civ v is a really good game for those strategic, thinking gamers out there. and you dont even need a knowledge of world history because you create it! yes, i know its not an indefinite amount of possibilities (though that is a drawback for some people) it has a bunch of other things. the original game only has a certain amount of civilizations, though, so if you have enough, buy it with an expansion (or two) and as many dlcs as you can afford, because i assure you it is worth it. i would give this a 9/10 because of my tastes. i mean, i love the game, but as a game you control without an indefinite amount of possibilities, i am one of the many people who find that a drawback. other than that, its an amazing game!",45.9
"very easy to get sucked into. i end up playing for hours on end whenever i start this game up, and its well worth thirty dollars.",138.6
"if youre bored and need something to do for a couple of weeks, civ 5 is the game you need",28.4
"want to start a game at 7am, look at your clock and think about maybe going to bed at 3am, realizing you just fastforwared through time? buy it. buy it for a friend. travel through time together.",32.9
"oh this game is the bomb! other than the lag on multiplayer this game is beast!",112.5
"very fun and addictive. it has a lot a replay value and the workshop extends it even further. the dlc is also fun and worth it.",80.5
"ive played all of the civilization games. but this game upd the bar once again. it will keep you glued to your screen. graphics 4/5 gameplay 5/5",95.9
"this game, even without its dlc, is absolutely phenomenal. how many other games let you progress from men with pointy sticks all the way to the nuclear age, while juggling your empires growth and spread, citizen happiness, resources, culture, diplomatic relationships with other civilizations and technological advances? and thats before you get into its dlc which adds tourism, religion, espionage and trade routes. the only flaw is how long it takes to play a game.",134.2
"sid meiers civilization v is a triumph in pc gaming. there is no other turn-based strategy game of its kind. civ v is the most balanced, complex (in a good way), in-depth and addicting pc game i may have ever played. this game oozes the just one more turn mentality and is hard to stop playing. with a plethora of races/civs to choose from, this title offers an uncanny amount of replayability. trust me, this game is a must have.",867.3
"it is an amazing game that lets you create a civilization and help along as it goest through ancient era to postmodernism. the huge number of civilizations lets every game become unique and the great music lets you be immersed in the civilization that you are carving.",39.6
"a real time-vampire, a massive time sink, a something of time a passer. i dont know, just buy the damn thing!",260.1
"like a mixture of crack and heroin injected directly into your jugular.",286.2
"amazing game! first civ game ive played, and i think its incredible. well balanced, higher difficulties are actually challenging, definitely the kidn fo thing i can sink 200+ hours into and still going.",343.7
"the one unit per tile improvement is great (no more stacks of doom, fights are more interesting). also, the ui of the game is top notch, much better than its predecessors. i highly recommend this sequel.",20.4
"the civilization 5 gold edition rocks.(i have just begun playing brave new world) the only thing i have a complain about is that why is there a future tech? i personally am a fan of civilization 3.the reason being it has a bit of a science fiction side to it(technology wise).when are they going to make some thing parallel to it i wonder.but civ 5 is good too.it has religion and espionage.one thing that bugs me why is the espionage branch unlocked late in the game?but other wise its good as it is.i give it a solid 8 out of 10.",1.8
"great game, i spended houres already and ill spend even more playing it!",540.5
"if someone asked me what game i would reccomend to introduce them to pc gaming, i would immediatly reccomend this. this has been one of the more involving and rewarding games i have ever played, and would reccomend it to anyone. i will go ahead and say that if you have never played a similar game to this before, there is a pretty steep learning curve that will at first be overwhelming, but power through and you will understand why this game recieves such high praises.",50.8
"really great game. gotten all of my house mates to get it and we play it together almost every weekend.",68.8
"good luck not spending at least 10 hours at a time playing this game. easily one of the best strategy games of all time.",123.9
"hmm i have a life ill stop next turn... oops how did 25 turns pass oh well i guess ill stop next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next. turn.",117.4
"ah, civ v. kind of disapointing in the feature it lacked compared to iv, but has made itself up for that in the two main dlc so far. the first one got up to nearly par with iv and the second surpassed it. i also love the combat more by making unit groups more important than just stacking a bajillion units in one stack. mind you, you still needed artillery, but you get the idea. it is a much more interesting system when it involves more around units specifics. id suggest this to any 4x lover.",337.3
"think board game without the messy packing and maintaining of pieces. think semi-intelligent, competitive ais. think age of empires and empire earth rolled into one, minus rts. time consuming, but when it comes down to pitboss (turn based multiplayer you can come back to any time), youll keep going, one more turn! this is a game for you if you excel at planning and predicting other players moves. just think chess that includes worker pieces, and against up to 31 other players.",61.2
"ive been playing civ v for quite some time with friends, and while it has a few glaring problems like  ai that runs units to their death in your citys with no chance of taking it and gandhi and his opness. its otherwise a great time vampire more so with all the xpacks adding sorely needed features like religions in gods and kings and actual trade networks in brave new world. if you have tens of hours to drop into a game per setting this is the game for you as hours just disappear before you know it, you start playing at 3pm and in the blink of an eye its 1am.",194.7
"one of the best of the civ series so far. the game is beautiful. the gameplay suffers in a few areas but the game is very playable. if you play civ at all this is a must buy as well as the new expansion for it. it adds a lot of new things to make the core game much better.",4.7
"better than civ 4 so far. no more unit stacking makes military victories easier. culture rush is nerfed. even cities without any units can bombard barbarians. no more transports needed to travel overseas is very nice. no more religions. the social policies are simpler too. a-",80.6
"awsome game and has hundreds of hours of replayability",499.8
"civilization v is an amazing real time strategy that i personally recomend for all levels of gaming but i agree that this game is a good choice to play.",12.3
"just 1 more turn never seems to be enough when playing any civ game, and this one is no exception. great gameplay, with new hex maps and different twists on ideas from the older civ games. cant go wrong with this one.",261.9
"look, ive played this series since civilization ii back in the day of pixel sprites and beatles music. civ v, the latest installment is great. the base game is sort of lackluster compared to the complexities of civ iv, but gandk and bnw (the expansions) help to flesh out the gameplay and give it that true civ feel. do i recommend? yes, i do. a/5.",389.9
"it is the peak of the series of great strategy from sid meiers it has gone from avarage to best civ game i have played since 4 with its 2 addons that are must for the ultimate experience. you can spend hundreds of hours to this guaranteed if you like almost any strategy.",117.4
"ghandi is a , atilla is cheap, and washington is a  douche",138.4
"for some reason no matter how many times i repeat this game, it never gets old. everyone i know who has played it, including me has loved it. just buy it when it goes on sale.",31.4
"tis a great game if your a strategey fan (turn based games) and if you know your way with money, its great with freinds and i highly recommend it to you and your freinds.",18.1
"amazing update to civ iv. however, they switched up the fighting and the only one unit per square, including workers, can get tricky.",119.5
"this game is fantastic. it has a great gameplay, great visuals, however it is a little bit difficult when you start out. its easy to create games and just play, but requires some amount of thinking, which most games dont require now-a-days. i rate this game 9/10",72.9
"turns based stratagey, you could say its your turn to take command.",69.7
"first i was a littel skeptical about the game. but then i tried it, and i been hook for 11 hours in one day.",123.5
"after many hours of playing this game is excellent when you just want to sit back and enjoy a even paced game. it can be a bit slow playing against other people, but then again i dont have the skillz to hold up against most people who play this online.",272.2
"ill finish this review after ive had... one... last... turn...",135.9
"very fun stratergy. i recommend you buy all the dlcs with it.",74.4
"lost hors to the game so may methods of play and civs to star as its great",238.1
"been playing civ for years now... never managed to get tired ! :)",18.6
"good, fun, thoughtful, intense. all words i would use to describe this great game.",6.5
"8.5/10 pros - awesome multiplayer - history lessons? - addicting - good balance cons - buggy multiplayer occasionally - some parts are boring. - large learning curve.",92.0
"the most detailed and complex civ yet. absolutely awesome!",232.0
"great single player, the multiplayer is epic. i wish you could form alliances though... 8/10",37.6
"when i play i cant stop. it has ruined my life. my wife has left me and i cant see my children anymore. i havent been outside in 2 weeks. 4/5",67.6
"fantastic turn based strategy game. i actually before tbs to rts, as i enjoy considering every externality over reacting. get this with brave new world and gods and kings. it really makes the game fantastic.",152.8
"fantastic game! you can sit down and play what you think is 5 min and look outside and its dark its so imercive",180.3
"have you ever wanted to  and pillage the countryside as the mongol hoards and play settlers of catan at the same time? really? wow, you are ed. but here you go!",66.2
"i set up a game to reinact ww2. it was an 8 player game with the chinese, japanese, germans, russians, polish, americans, british and i played the french. i minded my own business until just before the modern era, the germans unloaded a full scale assault on paris. i wasnt surprised. everything was going according to plan until the americans backstabbed me at orleans. it was completely uncalled for. the historical inaccuracies really bring this game down from a 10/10 to a 5/10. would not recommend ever playing the french. much betrayal, such conspiracy, so war.",167.7
"time consuming but incredibly fun strategy game which has the ability to take hours and make them feel like minutes.",66.2
"1-unit per tile replaces tedious unit stacking with something similar to a tactics rpg. policies are an excellent new feature, adding more fuel to the 1-more-turn-fire. diplomacy still not believable, with ais to hard to please. ai is still not a human, not vrey bright tactically. beautiful. overall, still the best 4x strategy series, made better with steam and modder community merge.",55.3
"this is a fun entertaining game bilt for people that love civilization based games.",141.4
"while civilization v introduces a whole new hexagonal/no-unit-stacking system which may alienate some of the veterans of earlier civ games, the shift also introduces a new challenge for these veterans to master. getting the gods & kings add-on also brings a revamped religion aspect to the game, as well as a whole new batch of civilizations to master. join the fray with your favorite.",183.8
"everybody go and throw money at it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",234.1
"a great strategy game for all ages. i strongly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys watching something grow over a long period of time. the graphics are good, a.i. is great and the diversity is fantastic. though it takes a lot of patience, it is a great game when you have developed your civilisation. 9.5/10",39.0
"endless hours of gameplay potential. civ 4 may be the all around better game but v is in my opionion just as good and newer and better looking.",43.0
"basically the same as geometry wars, except there are only hexagons. 10/10",101.6
"a lot of civ iv vets hated on this game when it first came out and i was reluctant to get it because of that. however, with the improvements and dlc additions, civ v has all the best parts of iv with some welcome additions.",156.4
"it is a very good game played them over the years the only one i never played was the spaceone i think.",58.2
"this game. . . i dont know where to start. its a whole new history. a whole new world. you make history your own! not the way it was made. greece could have defeated rome! america could have lost the revolutionary war!",43.9
"a huge timesink! yes, enjoyable. wish i had the time for it; it usually takes about 8h to finish a short game. i generally find myself playing rush nations to make up for it~ probably wouldnt enjoy it as much if it werent for my addict brother.",81.2
"one of the single best strategy game ever made, plain and simple.",132.8
"this is my favorite strategy game of all time and one of the best ever created. civ v will have you playing for hours egging you on to lead your civilization to greatness. wartime strategy works amazing and theres so much content here that it will keep you hooked for a long time. while i do wish more options could be available on the diplomatic scene this game is a masterpiece. 9.5/10",129.0
"you conqueor nations, you concqueor your friends nations. you pillage and plunder to your hearts content until you either rule all or get your  handed to you. what could be more fun than that? really? what?",22.0
"how do i describe civilization 5? the short answer is that you cant. this is for one reason only. if i were to put this gaming expierence into words, it would ruin the game for many. this game has that x-factor that i look for in most games. where you can sit down, play and tell yourself oh look, its only 10pm. one more turn wont hurt. and before you know it, it is the dawn of a brand new day, and all you care is that next turn. this game never gets old because each game is entirely different, and i think that with all these things, 2k has put together a winner in civilization 5.",66.8
"theres something strangely satisfying about starting out as a village in the middle of nowhere and ending as the industrial power of the world.",118.5
"*gnome seal of approval* i have never really played any of the previous civilization games, but i heard that this was more friendly to the newcomers and easier to get into. i would have to agree. i picked it up and took my time with it. this is one of the few strategy games i can currently handle. partially because its turn based and partielly because i can set the difficulty lower than most people would while i learn the game. civilization veterans doesnt seem to like it as much though.",70.6
"i have purchased several simulation games; city builders, world creators, future and past but this is the game i always come back to. i find unlimited replay value by varying the conditions and raising the bar ever higher.",900.7
"i recommend this game due to the enticing game mechanics. the sense of actually building your civilization from the ground up starting at practically stone age all the way to futuristic technology and 4 different ways to win the game... i find this game inticing.",94.6
"what can i say? its a fun game with lots of time to be put into it. even as much as ive played it, theres a lot i have yet to do. civilization may be stategy lite, but its by no means shallow, and this game is no exception. if you have the oppurtunity to check it out and you enjoy strategy game of any type, its well worth the money and time.",40.5
"civ 5 has made several changes to the base game systems. some have worked (medieveal warfare is a blast), might work (simpler happiness system) - some not (culture, ai cannot handle the 1 unit per tile rule). that being said, the game is still solid, and the major dlc (gods and kings, brave new world) has only added to the experience.",774.5
"really nice break from all the fps insanity. this is a great game to relax, and slowly destroy your enemies through strategy. tried it on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. fun for hours.",197.8
"love it, no matter how many times i play its always different",136.5
"im a huge fan of civ 4 and was initially disappointed with civ 5. i came back to it after the gods and kings expansion was released and absolutely love it. there is a depth to this game. you can play a whole game without going to war once, depepnding on subtlety and alliances, or you can be a warmonger and invade everyone. the choice is yours. a great game and worth the effort, especially with the new expansion. edit: brave new world further adds depth with trade, archaeology, culture and diplomacy playing a larger role. an excellent addition to an already great game. highly recommended.",319.3
"turns, spice trading, hexes, war elephants, evil gandhi . . . why havent you bought this already?",105.1
"played twice. 7 hours each time. great time waster",14.1
"i really like the game and think it is really good but my only problem is probably the trade routes. i do not feel like they are efficient enough nor are the roads at times.",1047.0
"lots of one more turn. very enjoyable, not a heavily graphic intensive game.",436.4
"quick immortal george washington in the year 750 bc we need your help making america and then america builds the great pyramids and overruns alexander the great with crossbowmen and catapaults and then russia declares war on you and marches on your capital with spearmen so you retaliate with a few american chariots somewhere my history teachers breaking his face open against a desk while im being a magical egyptian homunculus that can make people work twice as hard when theyre building huge mystical constructs that everyone in the world stops building the second youre through making them because of what im going to call sorcery",131.7
"theres very much that can be said about civilization v, but in short: it is certainly worth a purchase, but make sure you get the gold edition at least as its kinda empty without it. multiplayer can be pain to set up too, but apart from that its a game you could get lost in for days. hopefully we get even more dlc!",78.4
"civilization v is a easy to approach turn table game. being my first ever turn table game i found that it has helped me enter an area of gaming i had never considered before. thanks civi :)",140.9
"like always, the civilization series are all solid games, civ 5 does not dissaopoint",284.5
"i didnt think id like this game. id tried another civ game before and it hadnt been my taste of thing. i tried this and it just works. there are so many options to work with for shaping your nation, and (with a little imagination) you can create victory conditions for yourself. it is a good game to play and is very worth your time.",161.5
"if this game was a lady i would be having an affair.",995.1
"if you are into to turn based strategy games then this is for you enjoyed many of hours passing the time with this game very addicting. recommended especially for multiplayer aspects nothings more fun then global domination over your friends.",61.0
"play on easier settings to get the hang of it, and never switch off; because youll be decimated before people learn to speak with vowels. civ 5 is great fun. civ fans im sure have some contrived complaints, like a groupy complaining about a new album no ones heard of. but if youre a normal human, youll just love it, aboely love it.",44.5
"probably one of the best 4x games released in the past few years. get the brave new world expansion, as well.",38.8
"civ 5 removes many aspects of the game that bogged down the game part of civ. if you need those extreme micromanaging things in your civ game you probably will not enjoy this game. but if you are looking for a game over a hardcore simulation you will find that the changes in civ 5 are very welcome to those looking for a game and not a simulation.",60.1
"this game is great for someone who enjoys slow-paced, tactical thinking. you guide a civilazation from its inception to its complete world dominance, (or its demise). there are several options to go about winning such as social, war, and political. its a very fun engaging game and its very satisfying to watch your fledgling civilazation grow into a dominant power in your world.",15.9
"right now, i have 171 hours spent on this game. doesnt that say it all? its amazing, addictive, but mindless enough you can play it on one monitor whilst watching a movie on the other. i highly recommend the mods. a lot of them build really nicely on the vanilla game, adding a lot more units and styles of play. i almost always play with mods now because the changes are too good to ignore.",197.6
"i have been playing civilization since the original, i can honestly say that this is by far the best civilization yet. it has complexity that a civ veteran will love yet can also be played in a simple way that a first time civilization player can still enjoy and have all the tools needed to learn to play in game. using mods is as easy as browsing an in-game steam workshop browser.",850.8
"buy and play if you want to lose hours of your life to its wonderful playableness.",73.3
"spent plenty of time on this game, its an awsome time sink, definatly recommend.",305.5
"this game is by far the best life consumer ever. it may take you 15 + hours to win a game but if your into it you dont relize your weekends gon until its sunday night. this game is excellent i give it an 11 out of 10",68.6
"not much to say. very addicting and fun! can get you hooked for hours on end!",14.8
"engrossing and addictive gameplay that perfectly captures the essence of just one more turn style gameplay. this is the thinking mans (or ladys) strategy game with a plethora of historical and prehistorical references.",106.8
"one of the best games of all time. you should definately buy this! (and all the expansions) be warned tho, you will get addicted, and many hours will be wasted. just one more turn...",395.4
"deep engaging god game with overtones of the best of everything you would want. up too late is normal as is the desire to succeed at one more something. you will eventually want to play.",326.5
"the best civilization ever. really suprised at the beginning with all the different mechanics. also to fully enjoy the game you really need all the dlcs especially brave new world nad gods and kings wich really add depth into the game. i really recommend for any strategy player and especially for civilization fans. it can put you about 1000 hours of gametime and you will not get tedious especially with workshop integration and full mod support. also total bug free game. wich by today its a really shinning point on a game. never had any issue 0 ctd.",201.9

"as england my people starved and i distroyed every nation in the world! 10/10 i make a great leader.",37.9
"this game is awesome especially with a group of friends! i recommend this game to everyone! if your new to this game it isnt terribly hard to learn it but the is a steep learning curve which is a huge part of the fun!",110.9
"with the brave new world expansion civ5 is probably the best turn based strategy game i have ever played.",85.7
"im not usually a fan of 4x games, but civilization v managed to grab my interest and kept me pressing the next turn button over and over again. definitely get on discount.",4.4

"very addicting, multiplayer may sometimes have bugs, but very fun!",33.6
"this game is incredibly fun. i havent even begun to scratch the surface of this game and im already hundres of hours in and having too much fun.",156.6
"15 minutes in and i know i am going to love this game. just what i needed to get my strategy/war fix.",62.3

"no other turn based strategy can beat it. best one ive played.",282.0
"hours upon hours of fun. if you are new to civilization games, this is the perfect one to start with.",259.6
"buy this game so you can wish you never did as it sucks away all your free time.",205.7
"i start up a small, quick, earth-shaped map. and to make things quicker i set the era to the industrial era (a bit past halfway through the tech tree, the game becomes fun after that point). however, i turn on only domination victory. after conquering all of earth for the chinese, i realized that 10 hours had passed. this game is the ultimate time-killing addiction, and its a ton of fun, even for an impatient gamer like me. the game is actually very simple, but the way its designed makes it feel more complex. dont get if you want to do anything productive.",144.6
"it reminds me of the first age of empires games, just this is turn based. i love it and i cannot stop playing it. :)",40.2
"not as great as civ iv but still has that quality feel of a civilization game.",227.5
"really fun if youre into strategy games. if you can manage to find friends to play it with or just people online, the games take ages but theyre worth it.",14.3
"this game is an extremely good strategy game, though players should have enough time and patience to finish one game since decent ones can last up to a few days.",266.1
"this game is probably the best money i have ever spent on a game. it has beautiful graphics, mod support, scenarios, so many things i have not even delved into. everyone should get this game.",260.3
"this is a fantastic game with seemlessly endless fun on offer, the best part is that if you get a little bit bored of it then just try playing as a different civilisation and try a differnet tactic for victory, you will get a differnet experience each time. simply astounding.",352.4
"alot of fun if played with friends, great lan part game, the ai is kind of lacking though :(",69.8
"this game is a well-crafted, fun-filled timesink. hours can seem like minutes. i highly recommend.",94.6
"this game is brill as long as you play with other people, after playing by yourself for a while it starts to get a bit boring.",66.8
"best game lots of fun lots of love to the creators keep doin what you do",4.7
"good strategy game, now that i know beyond earth is not worth buying at the current price, i look foward to purchasing brave new world, plus the other dlc when they go on sale, i was always hesitant to waste money on the dlc when the the great beyond earth was right around corner from release",246.9
"a classic. complex, but worth learning. one of the best games of all time (if you also have the expansions for it: gods and kings & brave new world, also note that brave new world is the more recent expansion and adds all of the functionality of gods and kings but does not include the civilizations from gods and kings). highly addictive gameplay that will have you staying up too late for just one more turn. with a great range of difficulty levels there is something here for everyone: from the civ rookie all the way up to strategy pros. cant recommend this game enough!",587.8
"i get to play germany and create world war 3! this is an epic turn based game and i love to play this in my spare time! i highly reccomend that people buy this game!",43.4
"best strategy game on the planet so far. played only 0.4 hours so far, but loved it to the max!",0.4
"this has o be the best strategy game i have ever played. you wamt to make sure you make allies with the people you trust the most and youm want to go to war with one at a time slowly destroying them. but make sure to do this destroy india as fast as you can.",87.1
"almost as good as xcom. ie better than almost everything.",112.0
"kind of boring for me. i guess it depends on what pace you like your game to be at. other than that, really good game. 9 out of 10 if you dont mind how slow this game can be. otherwise 6 out of 10(my personal rating). edit: ghandi is a complete jerk. a nuclear powered jerk. whatever you do, kill him first.",18.8
"very fun game, it sparked an interest for history and anthropology when i started to play it. weird, but whatever.",70.0
"destroying other civilizations simply because you can",118.6
"is game with fighting and culture and religion and buildings and farms and roads and walls and pyramid and science is good",136.1
"gold edition is a must, as vanilla was incredibly broken. this is a true strategy game, in the same vein as age of empires.",100.2
"bore yourself to tears! watch turns load for several minutes! get famous figures of history to swear at you in a foreign language!",918.6
"i start playing this game and i lose track of time (and space). one of the best turned based strategy games. the multiplayer is kind of buggy and likes to drop connections(havent tried bnw mp yet) but was incredibly fun with 6 people.",130.6

"a little time with a little thinking, and the worlds yours.",653.8
"the best strategy game ever continues to be the best strategy game ever. ive become a god.",181.1
"from my personal opinion this is one of the best games i have played in a while.",370.2
"this game is amazing. just truly amazing, to the point of speechlessness. you take control of one of many civilizations, ranging from the americans to the egyptians, and try to make your civilization last the test of time. there are five unique ways to win, many amazing units and strategies, and thousands of unique ways to set up a game. the multiplayer is phenomenal, the modding community is the best this side of minecraft, and it runs amazingly smooth. this gives it many advantages over the previous games in this great series. if you want a quality strategy gaming experience with some history on the side, this is the place to go. and with the recent brave new world expansion (which i pre-ordered), it got way better.",720.8
"the graphics in this game are truly beautiful to look at, and the story background on each of the leaders is very interesting. like all civilization games the tutorial is pretty thorough, but it does take running through the tutorial to even get close to understanding what to do in this game. it definitely is a game i would come back to time and time again. the fact that i got it on sale from steam just made it even more awesome!",3.7
"this is real value for money i would recommend this to anyone, i would also go as far as to say that it is better that the forth civ which i loved and played for months.",45.8
"awesome game with a lot of content and possibilities to enjoy",527.7
"brilliant all round really, excellent if you just wish to pass the time, or if youre up for more of a challenge! 5 stars!!",98.7

"played a game where i was winning, later someone started a nuclear winter. 11/10",30.0
"bought this game about 2 weeks ago, can barely put it down. this game is really fun and has alot of playtime to offer. overall immortal is pretty insane. scouts turn into archers and maria theresa is overpowered. 10/10",69.9
"the gold standard when it comes to turn based strategy. this series has time and time again proven to be endlessly entertaining offering a great deal of complexity and depth. i would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a game like risk.",275.7
"great game, played the original and now i even play beyond earth. civilization v is still my favorite.",167.3
"id like to start by giving you a warning: you will get addicted to this game. this game pretty much has an endless amount of outcomes when dealing with other civilizations & you will not be disappointed with this game. i highly recommended this game & i also recommend getting the dlcs for this game. but, a fair warning, (again): with the dlc brave new world, it is a bit tricky to understand at the beginning. it does big a bit of a new diplomatic system to the game, but it is a great improvement over the old one, (which is still a good one too).",416.6
"civ v is a great turn based strategy game which lets you take history and make it submit to you as the master of all history and other boshtets. in all seriousness, the best part is being able to bomb poor s who still use crossbows and swords and crap. id reccomend this game to turn based strategy fans and people who really like seeing rome become a world power and stuff.",127.1
"it was a interesting and creative game. it had limited resources that made it more of a challenge but gives you a reason to expand to other regions. the idea and story behind the game is truely a recipe for fun and creativity. i have payed these games before on other systems and inever get tired of all the things i can complete and do on civilization.",3.6
"very cool strategy. i advise everyone who likes to reflect and build your own empire",12.9
"had to go to hopsital because my eyes got so dry from a 10 hour game. 10/10.",262.5
"a very enjoyable game that requires strategy, depending on what difficulty you choose. its really fun because of the four ways one can win the game: domination, science, culture or diplomatic. in my opinion, the easiest victory to get is domination because the ai is aggresive but that shouldnt hinder getting achieving victory by other means.",161.8
"i was getting a little frustrated with civ v as it was first released, but with all the tweaks and improvements of the 2 expansions (gods and kings and brave new world), civ is once again at the top of the list for my favourite games to spend the evening with! i can recommend this whole-heartedly.",345.0
"the initial game? nothing special. the expansions are what makes this game civilization. if you want to pick it up, get the complete edition. theyre on sale often enough and definitely worth it.",550.3
"multiplayer is a bit buggy but it is still a brilliant game. especially in this sale, the full version for 9 is incredibly cheap",76.6
"i had played civilization iv and had loved it instantly. later, when civ v released, i used to dismiss it as hex tiles and stuff, until i played it with all expansions. its the best game from the series in my opinion. :)",79.8
"worked for a week maybe two, very nice game but suddenly wont start at the loading screen exits back to windows, i have read a lot on the internet and there are a lot of reasons for this crash,other people have or had the same issue, frankly speaking after 2 days of trying to fix i gave up. i felt very sorry about it, i wanted to buy also beyound earth but i think is waste of money. if you release a game it is normal to be a functional one not put the clients to spend a lot of time trying to fix it. the game it is very nice but the support it is awfull. i hope that other users not to have my problem and to enjoy the game.",54.0
"classic strategy gaming, awesome technology tree system, and epic customization options. 10/10.",13.2
"people say this is great, and it really is. i just played it properly for the first time and it turned out that i cant stop playing even when i realised its 2 in the morning and i have school tomorrow. this game is additive. playing it is like selling your soul to a devil or something. i dont think i have a life anymore.",62.9
"this game is fantastic. once you begin to play you cant stop and you loose track of time.",37.3
"nothing like wasting uranium on nukes and repeatedly nuking catherine the greats russian empire just cause you feel like it.",213.4
"if you have played and enjoyed age of empires, and empire earth, this is a welcoming face in the genre. unlike the empire games mentioned, its turn based thus giving a game of more stratergy, instead of spamming units.",192.6

"this game is one of the best turnbased strategy games i have played to date. i was a little aprehensive about the new tile system and no unit stacking that was in civ iv, but it works out brilliantly in the end. was a little dissapointed that they did not include a few key features that ended up as expansions like espionage, but overall i thoroughly enjoy this game. if in doubt, i would certainly reccomend picking up at least gods and kings with this to better the overall experience.",88.4
"fun fun fun fun. this game is very, very addicting. definitely worth buying! i love it.",23.7
"classic and extremly addictive. one ... more ... turn ... :)",9.7
"every game is different so there is always a new experience. its a fun turn based strategy that wont get old.",237.4
"a big disappointment. play civ iv or ii. this must be a joke.",80.9
"a game that really can spend whole day sitting infront of the pc and play. even more interesting and fun when you have lots of friends playing together as all of us can plan with their own style and battle among each other to know whos the best strategist.",93.4
"i have played all the civilization game and no other game is like this. starts out slow but builds and the end game is so good and worth it when on sale. get all the dlc you can",39.5

"get this game and get brave new world. if you have a single strategy-loving bone in your body, just do it. i am not kidding.",250.4

"very strategycal and fun game!you must have this if you into strategy games,based on turn by turn!",415.0
"while civilization 5 is a fine game (and this is coming from someone who doesnt really like stratergy games) - it has nice pacing, it feels different every time, you can play a single match for literally days. ... i do add a word of caution though. this game is 20 full price. each of the two dlcs are also 20 and they are both very much nessicary to get the full experience. so your full game is costing you 60 and there is no way i can justify that price. basically, get this, but wait till a flash sale.",138.7
"game for all occasions! but, be prepared to put some serious hours every time you play. with the addition of brave new world, the already great game became greater.",125.6
"this game is great if you play with your friends. when you go online people are very cheap and get things rather quickly because they find ways to make one city be a power house and for them to win a game quick. which is why i never recommend on playing online but only online with friends to just have fun.",399.1
"great game but i feel it requires some of the dlc to have great fun",3.9
"definitly one of my favorite games. i would give this game a 9.8/10. each civilization is unique and there are numerous amount of map styles and different ways to play through each game. gods & kings: this dlc added religon which made the game much more dynamic and also added more civilization leaders to play as which some have awesome perks. brave new world: completely changed the way the game is played but in a great way. the new caravans completely redesign how to make money as a civilization and the great writers and artist make winning a cultural victory much different.",163.7
"awesome multiplayer, does take some commitment though",128.2
"no game has given me more bang for my buck than this one here.",591.2
"imo they have changed the game mechanics to much and at times (although a good game) it feels like it shouldnt even be called civilization, if you love the game mechanics that civilization has been famous for and grown on from the 1st game play civilization 4 not this one. civilization 5 is a good game but its not civilization as should be!",23.0
"in the 100+ hours ive thrown into this game, i can easily say that civ 5 is one of the most addicting strategy games ive ever played. its the turn-based aspect about it that hooks me, i think; i need to just finish this next turn and that turns into 100 or so. ive not been able to delve into absolutely everything yet, all the map types and civs would take probably months of play, or a few nights on a wiki. if youre into a good strategy game and you dont mind putting a lot of time into a match, its good fun.",114.4
"great game if your into strategy not as great as civ 4 but still great game",554.0

"great game - more complex gameplay than previous versions and gorgeous graphics.",50.8
"one of my all time favorite games! truly amazing! a must play for all people who love strategy games. -potato_ninja and a fat penguin",289.0
"improving every aspect of the civilization formula, this is a must-buy for fans of the series, and a strong reccomendation for just passers-by.",250.7
"honeslty, with all the expansions, who wouldnt own this game?",255.3
"this game has destroyed my social life and caused my friends to alienate me. 10/10",175.4
"this game is great for people who keep a busy schedule. it is turn based and you can easily play this for 5 minutes a day, everyday, for a lifetime. (seriously, it will take a lifetime)",149.9
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played. its charming, witty, funny, and plays very smoothly, with very few bugs. the ai is intelligent, the maps excellent, and the game suceeds where so many others havefailed to captivate me.",196.1
"civ v is a fun game, but be sure not to take anything the wrong way. this game tends to ruin friendships. xd",41.2
"reminds me of the total war series. but better. without the rts aspect.",253.1
"i love this game! its so great. it is both entertaining and strategic. ive played 60 hours so far and i could easily play 60 more!",138.0
"civilization 5 is a very good game, the only thing missing from civ 4 is religion. the graphics are worlds better, it is very smooth, and my only complaint would be the time it takes to process ai movement with a large number of ai.",6.6
"very addictive game im glad i bought the game when it was only $12.49 for the complete edition but its really hard to install mods for mac :( shame.",81.5
"wow - start a game and then look at the time, its already 3am :o 10/10",20.2
"with 300+ hrs playing this game, i assure you that you wont get fed up with the gameplay. try yourself with playing on immortal or deity for maximum challenge!",324.0
"civilization v alone: 7/10 civilization v with gods and kings: 8/10 civilization v with g&k and brave new world: 10/10 civilization v with all dlc and alot of mods: 11/10 rules dont apply anymore",169.0
"i was antcipating this game for along time since i got my pc. i did not have alot of money to buy it.when i did get enough, i bought it. it did leave up to my expectation.although it will start abit slow but it speeds up very well.",40.3
"one of the best strategy games released in last years.",36.1
"great game! did a great job on this one it still had the feel of civilization 4, but had some new tricks and additions which helped gameplay.",16.0
"i barely even played before it quit working. tried 20 or more reinstalls, your steam server constantly loses communications, it i did get it loaded it would say unable to load something or another. constant issues. cant even play in offline mode anymore. a great game turned to crap.",16.3
"you start at the dawn of your civilization with a small city and build up over thousands of years to forge an empire spanning across sea and land. wage wars or play it safe and let others do your fighting for you via diplomacy. the gameplay is rich and deep with many different civs and units and a long tech tree to research new technology. each game is different and provides unlimited replayability. the game becomes much more and generally a better experience with the added expansions, and i wouldnt recommend playing it without them but, the whole set can come at a price. overall i highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone should have it in there game library.",311.8
"firm favourite of civ iv; but have new macbook retina chose to install civ v instead (on sale). played for several days: + graphics, new buildings and movement. - combat, diplomacy it seems that the game is even more time consuming and in depth. so far i prefer civ 4 as it sets the right balance for time and enjoyment.",22.8
"amazing strategy game. love it, and its addictive. both the addons are great, as they add religion, better trading and new units/civs. no matter which civ youre playing as, you will have fun! 10/10 edit: played as india, nuked everyone and won by domination, 11/10",180.4
"if you like 1. strategy games 2. civ 3. fun this game is for you !!! have fun",34.6
"good game but the online is major broke and is very annoying to play",32.2
"this game will eat hours away out of your free time so be warned. it is incredibly addicting and has insane replay value especially to those who enjoy multiplayer. it does need to be noted that both expansions, gods & kings as well as brave new world, are extremely recommended. without expansions the game feels not much better than a 7.0/10 but with the expansions (and optional dlc if you wish) it easilly will bring it to a 9.0/10.",434.3
"i recently purchased civ 5, and later got the gold edition pack and after that i bought gods and kings. civ 5 on its own is a good game, with thegold edition/gods and kings, it is a really good game, with brave new world, it is possibly the best strategy game on pc. its easy toget started but at the same time it is complex and deep. but with the good dlc costing 20/$30 it is difficult to recomend. if the dlc is on offer, get it.",124.9
"sid meirs civ 5 is all in all just like the last civ but this one doesnt let you stack units on top of one another. yet the only porblen that i have run into is the culture grew dealing with mountain tiles, you need tiles that touch one another to get them with culture or buy them with gold. however the mountains are a unusable so thought to be trash just like desert, but you can buld thing on deserts. never the less when you need two tiles to be able to buy or get with culture, becasue its greyed out and that second tile is a mountain the game doesnt think it is worth it. yet in doing so i am not able to have a town that was place by an iron tile for the iron and i couldnt get the iron for a lack of tiles of my right side",338.2
"its a fantastic game plain and simple. the expansions are brilliant and add exactly what the game needs, the ai arent the sharpest bunch but you still find that you get attached to them over the course of a civilisations history and are reluctant to destroy them. it holds alot of charm and has a high replay value. go and invest if you havnt already its worth the money.",166.6
"i will admit this game tested all of my skills as an effective leader and the experience will be daunting for most new players but with some practice (maybe solo games at most) the basic concept and structre of the game will become apparent and easy to master creating an unmatched rts experience. this game recieves the generals recommendation",12.7
"i really enjoyed this game. i found it works best for people who are also fans of board games or maybe have one or two other friends they wanted to enjoy a game with. it gets addictive at first, so when you buy it make sure you have a day free! also, this is a long game. it can take about 6 to 10 hours if you play on the quick setting. you can, at any point, save the game and continue it later. i believe it is worth the buy. the expansions add a lot to the game, but plain ole civilization v is fantasitic as is.",367.3
"vary good game not hard for new people to civ and vary fun you old ones to. i say all should get this game",109.1
"countless hours spent re-assessing current versions of history. never new ghandi was such a war-mongering little  until i played this game. also  germany. 8/10 replayability.",125.1
"well, who wouldnt wanna play this game? a great strategy game that you must have in your collection. in case you plan on playing civilization on older laptop. go for the civilization 3 version, as this one tends to bog down old laptops.",15.3
"an alright game, but not worth its price... get it on sale. it crashes a lot in multiplayer games, and the singleplayer ai is quite dumb. i could reccomend it if it were cheaper, but not for $50 for all the dlcs and the game...",216.8
"my friends told me not to go japan. i went japan and we lost our friendship. 10/10 would lose more friends again!",47.6
"this game is a well made strategy game.its well worth the money to purchase this game if you like to try out the variety in civilizations to play as or if you like to play competetive.a list of pros and cons. pros: random map generator good engine ability to select what era you start in players normally always on multiplayer lots of dlc content during steam sales its cheap cons: mod button not on mac unless you edit the game files without dlc its bland sometimes it takes too long for something. overall the game gets a 7.9/10",398.5
"ive played civilization games since the first one. they were all great, but civilization 5 is the most advanced. with a lot of added stuff, it has religion, ideologies and many little things with which you can rule your civilization - and conquer others. i havent played multiplayer yet, but single player, the game is awesome.",301.3
"the most approachable civilization game, but probably not the most balanced or most in-depth or most interesting. it gets a little grindy, with lots of repetetive turns, and lots of boring optimization, that turn it into a sort of zen experience rather than a heavily invested strategy game. lots of dlc and expansions have adjusted things to be way more complex and interesting though, and even if they didnt, the amount of content is staggering. 4/5",46.9
"just... one... more... turn... if you like strategy games, you really should play this game.",49.3
"its civ. i cant compare it to the previous games having never played them. its not a bad game to play with friends or alone in a room for a little too long.",16.5
"not as good as fall from heaven, but quite excellent. the diplomacy especially makes this perhaps the best civ of all time.",69.8
"one of the best strategic games ive ever played. you have to take your time for this game though as it takes quite a while. that does however make this game a great strategic game as it takes and gives you time to plan out all your tactics in making alliances, building up staying neutral or declaring war on all who oppose your ways of treading the world.",453.3
"i am totalu hooked to this game! i recomend this to everbody who likes controling large empires!",295.7
"warning: playing this game may cause loss of time, unnatural hatred towards gandhi, and the general distrust of every one around you. enjoy!",28.3
"sid meyers civilization v (or civ 5 as i call it) throws you into complete control of the nation you decide to lead. every decision you make could either affect you positively, negatively, or possibly both. between extreme aggression by certain leaders, and the very passive city-states that you will meet, civ 5 is something that never gets old. regardless of how you put it, at least an hour of your time will be taken up easily. you are the supreme commander of your nation; take control and lead your people to greatness!",181.5
"a must-have for every strategy fan. diplomacy system is a bit ... meh.",81.7

"its really fun but recently it has been crashing so if a patch comes out i reccomend buying it",59.8

"although i rarely ever play strategy games, i have to admit this game is addicting and very entertaining. going through the different gameplays and being the different world leaders is immensely inveloping. its definitely something id recommend!",224.4
"as a monarch ruling under the divine right of kings, i must infallably declare, regardless of my spelling, that this game is very enjoyable. this is a fantastic game for anyone who is into stratagy games. however, i must say that diplomacy in this game is impossible. dont even try. trust no one. beware ghandi. dont blink. blink and youre dead. dont turn your back, dont look away, and dont blink. good luck.",318.0

"this was once a really good game, but due to recent updates the multiplayer now sucks and it cant even go 5 minutes without having to reload (which itself takes 1-2 minutes). to summarize; its a good game... for single player... only!! (as of 11/15/14)",263.8
"addicting and takes hours of your life away. yet its totally worth it!",24.3
"excellent depth ... plenty of replay value, although i wish there were alternative progressions in the tech tree, rather than its linear nature.",118.4

"if you like turn based strategy, prepare to lose hours upon hours of your time.",71.1
"one of the best rts games i have ever played! its so fun trying to dominate your opponents or beat them by reasearching enough to build the apollo space program or by getting enough votes in the united nations to win! a lot of fun but frustrating when you lose!",40.4
"never played a civ game before, always been more of a real time fan, having got this, i spent hours on it, lots of fun even more with friends with co-op or agaist each other... multiplayer can bug out now and then but nothing a few saves cant fix. would recomment this to anyone who likes to build empires, create massive tradeing powers, or anyone who likes to roll over people with a massive army, so many ways to play so many ways to have fun.",422.7

"i still dont like not being able to stack units to make a military or fleet in one square. if a city of 50 milion can exist in one square, why does a unit of swordsmen, pikemen, and bowmen take 3? i also miss being able to take over other cities with culture. but it is probably the best stradegy game still. nothing compares.",294.4
"my favourite in the series and all in all an amazing game",23.9

"great game. can lose several days of your life engrossed.",317.5
"this is one of those games that you need time to play. i love the game dont get me wrong but, if you do not have alot of time on your hands, the quick games (unless in mp) are not as fun. so far i love the game and would give it a 9.5 out of 10",1018.9
"the best turn-based empire buildingfranchise on the market. period. if you havent tried yet, you are missing out on many a sleepless night. although not as polished as its predecessor, it still leads the way in the gameplay department.",595.7
"do you have hours to waste? like looking at maps and thinking? well then this will be like porn",56.3
"love it, mainly for the strategy because strategy games are my favorite games",248.4
"with over 500 hours spent in the game so far, civilization has extreme replayability. there are so many random elements, no two games are ever the same. this is one of the best strategy games of all time. all versions of the game are good, but this latest one gets it all right: graphics, ambient sound, music, physics, gameplay, and balance.",842.3
"its amazing. the game gives strong strategic values. it displays ancient quotes for players to ponder upon. and most importantly its extemely addicting because of these few yet strong traits.",207.2
"multiplayer is entirely broken. this is not acceptable for a game of this standing. every time a turn ends, my friends and i are forced back to the loading screen. this must be fixed asap.",298.7
"honestly, after playing this game for over 200 hours it is great fun. if you like building your civilzation from the ground up, this is your game. the only downfalls of this game are the online. it has a tendency to loose connection from the game and can sometimes delete those worlds. although of the one flaw, this game is great for wasting time in a way. lets say call of duty black ops 3 is comming out in 10 hours, this game is great for wasting that time. the mods for this game also are good. if you are questioning buying this game, you wont be disapointed in a stratagy veiw.",283.8
"a very addicting game as you can see by how long i have played. be ready to sacrfice time and all your energy as it can be intense but it is a must have game on steam! you go through different eras faced by man and try to make your civilisation prosper and win with the different victories.",195.8
"great game. wasnt sure about only being able to have one unit in a tile at a time but you dont even notice and it works really well. highly recommend this game.",238.2
"got to say, i received this game for free, tried it... and didnt like it.... but then... how do i have all the dlc? well, if you are one of those who didnt like it at first.... give it a try for several hours, i dont know how but it hooks you up and then drives you through unsuspected hours of fun. the basic game is good enough, but there is a point at late/middle game where you may feel it lacking your interest, the dlc fixes those and completes the game holes. some may remain but hey, give it a shot ;) i bought it later with all the dlc included, for me... the developers did a good game, earned my money.",129.6
"ill give this game a good rating but the problem with the multiplayer now a days is very annoying, but i believe that the devs will fix it besides that the game is real fun and can suck you in for to many hours.",848.5
"i loved it. makes you think real hard and is really making you think of what to do to win and the effect it will have on you. i love the different people you can play as and the balancing. only suggestion is that if the deplomacy and warmongering penalties were to be fixed, it would be flawless.",150.0
"i absolutely love this game. it is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable turn-based strategy games i have played in a long while with very indepth strategy behind it. however i cannot recommend this game. why is that? i have had a game breaking bug for the past 3 months that has made it impossible for me to get past the opening cinematics. i cannot enter the loading screen and there has been no attempts to fix this glaring issue and i know i am not alone on this. i have even went as far as to try and fix the problem myself, but to no avail. without this and some other completely terribly game breaking glitches i would highly recommend this, but for now i feel somewhat cheated.",213.6

"if you buy this game your life will be sucked away",155.2
"i could say so many good things about this game. but i am going to keep this fairly short. for any strategy lover or anyone new who want to start trying out new strategy games. this is the best place to start! its addictive, lots of dlc, generally just an extremely marvelous game! 10/10 by far!",207.4
"this is a great game and if you do not own it yet you should heavily consider picking civ 5 up. strongly recommmeded for edless hour and replayability. what are you waiting for?",168.6
"endless fun when playing against muslim, communist america!",546.5
"easily the best turn based strategy out there. quite different from its predecessors but thats not a bad thing as the older games still stand up well today so this just provides a solidly different game that is great on its own merits. top notch!",31.8
"to try and keep this brief, civilization five in one of the most refined strategy games on the market. the fact that even recently the game is still recieving both offical expansions, and user content should be a testament to that alone. building on the framework of pervious titles, and reworking nearly every aspect into a more streamlined approach might have back fired. yet, it still remains addicting and fun even after the years it has been released.",241.2
"this game is just magical, i really enjoy rewriting history:d",298.7
"if your lookingfor a strategy game with almost endless possibilites becasue of the steam workshop. your in luck!",85.2
"great game , turn based so low stress, build an empire",743.8

"can lose yourself in gameplay for hours with many interesting scenarios to play out or create for yourself. very nice graphics and soundtrack. go for it.",175.0
"great game not much to say other than the fact i can fap my historical nerdiness all over an open map. good to sit back and waste what feels like 2 minutes to what really is 3 days.",93.3
"just know that youre going to waste a lot of time on this game... 10/10 would get nuked by ghandi again",100.3

"if you like strategy games, you would totally want to get this game! this boardgame-like strategy game is the best and your family and friends will shiver in fear as they see you play as the leader of a great empire, they will bow to your will and none shall stop your reign over all beings! literally, the best!",147.2
"the complete edition of civ 5 is really a must-have. with the addition of bnw, the game finally feels like a finished, fleshed-out product. the ai of your foes is fixed and the ideologies get the attention they deserve. often i felt i was repeating actual history when faced with in-game dilemmas. 5 out of 5",394.6
"0/10 gandhi didnt  on my civ with nukes from the start",196.6
"i will always love civ games, but civ 5 kind of takes a step back. its not that challenging and its a lot the same as 4, but i liked 4 more. i do reccommend it though but if ur a civ fanatic like myself, its getting to be a lot of the same old.",104.7

"a great game, however you should be warned, once you start multiplayer, single player will never be the same.",560.4
"just one more turn. no, its never just one more turn. very addictive and fun. good for when you got a lot of time to spend.",30.8
"really additcting game, spent multiple hours taking over the world through dominitating and destroying with robots and nukes and also through winning the space race. their are multiple ways to win a campaign and that just makes it even better. civ 5 is a must buy for strategy lovers!",121.7
"ill give you v good reasons not to play this game. i. cant find whales. ii.ghandi is a . iii. my friends are . iv. no character customization. v. roman numerals are an outdated form of numbering things.",9.6

"i played this game since the first release and im happy to say that the game is ing great :) hope for more expansions!!",285.6
"this game is freaking awesome! it is the flagship of its genre, i have nothing bad to say about it, in its current state. the unfortunate thing about games like these is that they dont get amazing until they get like two expansions come out. in this case the expainsions g&k and bnw make the game a true masterpice. now i will admit that civ v isnt as committed to historical accuracy as europa iv, and its not as complex. however its so much fun to play. so much so, that your significant other may begin to resent the amount of time you spend playing it. the senarios are also great, especially if you only have time for a 100 turn game. i like the scramble for africa one myself.",507.8
"addictive but the high usually wont last a whole game.",123.8

"i love this game and all others like it thank you.",22.7

"if you want to start a meaningful marathon game, avoid the ancient era when setting up the game. your gameplay will be a lot more eventful.",78.1
"fantastic game. if you like turn based stratergy games civ v is a must have. all of the civ games have been great (ive played all of them since the first one came out on the amiga). civ v certainly delivers yet another wonderful game experience.",28.4
"this game is a 100% awesome. weather it be single player in a custom senario, or multiplayer with your friends. this game is fun and at times educational. i really like the fact that all the choices that you have to make and the repercussions and tensions of those choices in the ever growing world around you is like doing a action and getting a equal and oppisite reaction that is intreging to me, some things will be a postive gain some things a negitive, but you as a leader make the choices. shear might, science, mabye a diplomatic victory? you get to choose which road is best for your playstyle and culture and charater. i like to micro manage and control descissions and actions in games that i play, and this game pretty much gives you free reign on your own capitals, cites, and population. this game is 10/10 for me, i hope you enjoy:) cowboy",162.3
"this game is super adictive and fun you will get so mutch hours in this game it is a bit expencive. ps: get all the dlc it is mutch more fun so many more civs play styles and more you need to buy this game",157.5
"it would be awesome if its ing multiplayer wont be so lagging. you spend three hours with your friend to find a ing game, where you wont be kicked or something, you are playing a little and thenalmost all players have been disconnect, and couldn not connect to game anymore, what the ? i have never finished any multiplayer game : the game is great, but the multiplayer is piece of .",136.4
"so much fun, be prepared to spend countless hours.",19.7
"one of my personal favourites. what is better than choosing a historical leader and then building and expanding your empire, crushing your enemies trough economics, diplomacy or just good old warfare? very easy to pick up and play, but hard to master.",492.6
"civ 5 was my first taste of this genre and it qucikly became one of my favourite games of all time. this game has no weaknesses it has good graphics, easy to use interface, gameplay mechanics that are as complex and sohpisticated as you want and lots of replayability. i only wish that online multiplayer was easier to set up with strangers so i could play more civ 5. all in all, civilizations 5 is one of my favourite games and is well worth the buy.",177.0

"best turn based strategy game i have ever played. it is very detalized, and you will enjoy it if you want to simply overtake the whole world or play a very difficult game. it suits all levels. it has many things done to it in workshop as well. there is so much to tell that you just have to try it yourself. as i said. best i have ever player.",82.3

"i know it sounds stupid but i just hate the hexagon tiles in the game.thats about it really!$%^&*(_)",7.9
"simply the best in long-term strategy, and highly addictive. it provides for endless replay value (currently approaching 600 hours). this game is less about quick multi-tasking and unit micro-management, and more about thinking, planning, patience, diplomacy, analysis, and focus. a steep learning curve to start with, it takes about 50 hours or over a dozen full games or so to fully apperciate the many layers to this game. a regular game can take any where from 4 to 8 hours, depending on the difficulty level, number of other players, the size of your army, and the amount of time spent thinking in between turns. theres also options for even longer games. it is an immensly engaging and rewarding game.",633.7
"first game i played i trusted ghandi. it ended with me in a civil revolution and me losing all my cities. next game i nuked him. learn fast scrubs. will loose social life because just one more turn 11/10 would nuke ghandi again",211.2

"having played every civilization game since the original, at least the pc ones, i can say i really enjoy civ v. especially with the expansions i really dont see myself being able to ever go back to another civ game. for fans of civ games it opens up the flood gates to make any victory style a viable choice. for new comers you have a lot to take in but then again it is a strategy game and if strategy games are your thing a) you are use to learning curves and b) you cant get much better than civ.",322.6

"civilzation v is one of the most addicting and brilliant masterpiece that perfected sid meiers strategic game where you help a country build its way through war against other countries and upgrade your land and cities with new sciences, ways of thinking and architecture. its one of the best strategy games ive come to experience and continue to play for 100s of hours. 10/10",13.5
"awesome and addicting game, games do take a while tho",41.0
"if you love strategy games then this one is good for you. it offers a very custom experience, everything from landmass to how man empires you face down can be altered. and one of my favorites is to turn off the varied options such as culture, science, and social victories to focus on domination, squaring off against eleven other great nations in a race to rule the world is an entertaining experience, especially if you throw everything into science. steamrolling horse mounted archers with tanks is oddly cathartic. and with so many options and choices you can play through the game dozens of times and still discover new play options. the game and its expansion packs are worth every dollar.",49.0
"my first foray into the rts genre did not leave me disappointed. despite having trouble with initially launching it after downloading, it was well worth the effort to get it running. i sunk 6 straight hours into the tutorial alone (only to find that you cant save a tutorial game lol). it is a very good strategy game for anyone that has a lot of time on their hands.",22.7

"i have always loved the civ series, i still have a copy of the original on a 3.5 inch floppy. this is not the best in the series but its still ing brilliant, who dosent love kicking the hell out of the english using the celts, i know i do. my genetically predisposed hatred for the english aside this game is awesome, its like a more simple version of europa universalis (which incidently is one of my all time favourite games) and has a thriving mod and multiplayer community. while this game excels in single player the a.i is still easy to beat, against other humans this game is like pancakes dipped in single malt whisky.",536.9
"love this game. positives - looks great - wastes time - always fun negatives - cant destroy other peoples religion (as you cant raze capitals)",49.7

"pretty fun. takes a while to play through 1 game fully.",62.9
"an absolutley awesome game. huge improvements over the civ iv series especially now with the new expansion. i love the new hex tiles and the only one unit per hex rule. it really adds more to the game strategy. i sometimes take a break for a couple of months but then im back to play a few games. i love it because every time i get a new map. every game is unpredicable. every game im trying a different strategy.",160.9

"excellent quality. binds all of the qualities a turn based strategy should have and near perfects them. fun to play, at times a bit slow but enjoyable regardless. riddled with some questionable design choices it is sometimes frustrating to play. all around a truly high quality game. rating: 96%",342.2
"this game is crack. do i even need to say how good this game is?",463.0
"i have over 200 hours between me and my roommate invested in this game. it will eat your soul, and is a totally awesome advance over the previous installments. i really love how you can actually use tactics in civ v, because 1: it uses hex tiles for the map, and 2: you can have only one military unit per tile. it makes flanking and cutting off supply mean something in game. the tech tree fells a bit weird (i dont recall other civ games allowing you to advance up to steam power before you even had steal.) but its still pretty fun to mess with. youll play through this game many times (or at least start a ton of new ones) before you get it all, but its a learning experiance worth doing. this game is worth every penny. a great advance in the civilization world.",844.9
"the addition of the hex grid map and the removal of stacking units makes planning military campaigns a much more interesting challenge. the addition of policies also makes this game very intriguing, as you can choose to build up your strengths or overcome your weaknesses. the civilizations are also much more defined in their play style, and having an ai that plays the civilizations as they were led makes for a much more memorable game.",202.5
"civ 5 has finally become better than civ 4 thanks to g+k and bnw expansions. brave new world expansion is definitely worth picking up as it gives the game critical mass of features to make it fun to play finally.",41.0

"ive always been a big civ fan since civ ii and over 400+ in im still playing. the hexagonal tiles plus the combat system change plus the changes to great people (g&k) are some really great changes over civ iv that honestly almost make it impossible to ever go back. its biggest problem is the same that its always been - its pretty slow paced. this is a game that can take a month to play through an entire game.",482.9
"this is one of the great turn based rts that i ever played with. owning this game will never make you regrets because the every game you start there is a different situations that you might encounter and always not predictable specially if you are playing deity with 12 or more civiulizations to compete. the only thing that makes my game hard to finish is to win science victory in deity level. its very hard and awesome. 9/10",38.8
"warning: will suck away countless hours of your life! civilization v is easily one of the best games ive ever played. i play it a whole lot, and even my sisters and my dad play it. its simply amazing. its a great game to take off some stress after work, school, or even after playing hours of rage-inducing shooters. grab a drink, pick your favorite world leader, and relax, while you conquer nations, and get nuked by gandhi.",54.4
"some major changes, but i like them. way more strategic than just creating an epic stack and steamrolling the map. gods and kings dlc adds religion, and a few other parts of ai have had some updates. my only complaint is how dlc crazy they went this time. i would much rather have 1 or 2 substantial dlcs than 20 little ones, and then another that costs nearly $30 but only includes elements that probably could/should have been in the original release.",67.1
"great game to play with friends! the expansions add in content that gives the game more ways to win",162.4
"well, i played this game, and from what i can tell its most defining attribute is that its slow. sslloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwww. its what they call a ing long- game. a random map takes as long to beat as the entire single-player mode in some other games if you put it on the fastest setting. so i hope you have a lot of free hours. that being said, it is suitably addictive to make you want to play for that long. so there are worse games you could pick up.",73.7
"this is a great game which involves a lot of thinking. ai could use some work though.",276.6
"amazing game! well put together, and the graphics are great, especially on a desktop.",173.5
"this is civ5, a game where you conquer people and nuke stuff. at least according to me. for the uninformed, its a hexagon-grid turn-based strategy with a focus on combat, diplomacy, city management, and hurling nuclear weapons at people. no story here, folks, you make the story yourself. +good visuals. +stupid amount of mods. +map editor and modding tools. +scenarios are pretty cool. -ai is irrational in terms of diplomacy. -multiplayer exists, but its pretty bad. -no story except for what you make.",299.5
"find a free weekend and start playing civ. you will not regret it.",73.2
"one of the most awesome games i have ever played. and the dlcs are worth buying",170.5
"i love the entire civilization franchise; civ 5 is no different. its an amazing ton of fun to build your own empire. with the expansion packs of gods and king and brave new world (in addition to the other civs), the game becomes full - i highly recommend them as well. new to the game are city-states and a one unit per tile rule. this adds a great amount of strategy when thinking how to manage your military or dealing with other civilizations.",869.4
"if you like wasting hours of your life, and enjoying every moment of it.... buy this game. very fun long time startegy game.",481.8
"something you can waste a day into and still never finish a match. perfect time killer!",26.1
"it may be prettier, and the combat may be substantially better, but overall civ5 is several steps back from civ4. if i wanted to kill stuff in a turn-based strategy game, there are a lot of games that do it even better than this, and civ4 is better in almost all the non-combat areas of the game (aside from graphics, but whatever). disappointing. it does have potential though, and im hoping the expansions will eventually improve on the things that are lacking. it is significantly more approachable and easier to get into, at least. note that this is based on the base game only, and im somewhat unfairly comparing civ4 with all expansions to civ5 with no expansions.",28.5
"a great installment of the civilization series. after the expansions and the mods its almost perfect. the only downside is that the ai is not always the smartest - but then thats pretty normal for any stragety game since computers arent as smart as we are... yet.",261.1
"its a strategy game that both caters to the beginer and the expert strategy player. it is truely a work of art",154.4
"i never really was interested in the civ series until i finally decided to try civ 5, this is probally one of the best grand strategy games i have ever played. this game is very fun to play with friends who also own this game, i highly recommend this game.",54.7
"great game, meiers never seems to disappoint. the expansions are a bit pricey in my opinion but what game doesnt have expensive dlc anymore? but yeah, id definitely recommend. game for everyone with steam",62.3
"this game is sick. its fun if you need something that takes time and practice to play. you wont be an expert over night, but youll love it either way.",46.7
"the epitome of turn based strategy games. endlessly replayable, complex yet easy to approach, and some of the most reliably fun gameplay you will experience on the pc. a must buy for any strategy fan.",67.3
"only complaint: the ai has no idea how to play this game. i have a feeling that because of that, neither do i. its definately faster than iv. and the visuals and audio is great. youll see the shuffling around hoplites in 1866, but if that bothers you, turn up the difficulty so it gets some unfair help.",294.4
"fantastic strategy game! build your empire and play against the cpu or others online! its a highly complex, cerebral game that will challenge you every time!",822.6
"really fun game. you will always play one more turn....",91.9
"i absolutely loathe turn-based strategy games, but civ was a ton of fun for me. if youre afraid of the slowness, there are a lot of easy ways to turn up the speed. if youre not very much into strategy games, this game allows you to enjoy the strategy experience casually by giving you achievable yet challenging tasks. just make sure to turn the difficulty down a bit and the pacing up a bit. the tutorial and ui are very well-designed and are great for civ beginners. id recommend this over civ 4 unless youre into strategy games already...",41.0
"great fun by yourself or with friends! if you enjoy managing infrasture and war at the same time, then this is most likely a game for you",293.6
"prepare to not leave your computer for weeks at a time. instant classic.",1102.3
"very fun game. it mixes the fun of building a civilization and conquering the world together. it has different things you can do like go for the science victory. there are quite a few victorys and characters making the game interesting. it generates new maps so you will have a new experience every time. i would give this game a 9 out of 10. i highly recommend you buy this game.",238.6
"its civ. you just take a couple of . . . its civ. 92%",9.2
"combat is vastly better than previous incarnations. hopefully the expansion adds more depth.",27.1
"lots of fun building, exploring, warring. its different every game so theres tons of replay value.",96.3
"this is quite a heavy game to get into! there are so many ways to play, to win, and to build your civilization that youll go crazy if you try to formulate a single way to win every game. i really love the hexagonal grid that this game uses; it really sets this turn-based strategy apart from others. the hexagonal grid allows for much more movement and mobility than square tiles.",543.7
"do not say i played strategy game without playing civ.",265.7
"one of the greatest strategy games i have ever played.",281.1
"they should just cut the pretense and call it crack.",81.9
"a game that couldnt be more addicting, once you get into the meat of the game youll want to stay until the very end! very good for strategy lovers , and for a true challenge, try to obtain any victory other than domination, damn near impossible on the higher difficulty levels",346.3
"amazing strategy game! i love the new hex tiles and combat system. adds a whole new layer of strategy.",136.0

"civ5 is a great time sink, an activity for lazy days.",134.0
"5th iteration on the civilization series. increased tactical gameplay through a one unit per tile policy. major focus is still on civilization management, city development, and research vs income vs population happiness balancing. playstyle heavily influenced by social policy decisions. recommended for anyone that hasnt played the civilization series yet, recommended for on sale purchase for anyone else.",26.2
"for more than 20 years, a series of games civilization one of the best turn-based strategy.",1.6
"this is a really well put together game. the actual play is simple, though the strategy is deep. the work they put into the game shows, even down to the tiny details. for new players, the biggest challenge can be learning about all the different units, how some of the resorces affect things, but after playing a game or two you get the hang of it. it is also a good game to play with friends. i also like how you can win by using other methods then conquest like most strategy games.",104.1
"this game is terrible. ive played civ 2, 3, 4 and 5. for 2, 3 and especially 4, ive played hundreds of hours, and likely a thousand hours for civ 4. civ 5 put me to sleep. i tried. i hated it. dont trust me though. go to amazon reviews, and compare civ 4 and civ 5. common thread for people who like civ 5.... i thought strategy games would be hard, but this was not ... this is the game that taught me to never preorder a game again.",25.6

"my rampaging aztecs and i have found this game to offer countless hours of quality world-conquering entertainment.",987.4
"you play one of the best, most addicting, turn-baed stradagy games to exist for pc, civilization 4. you thoughts such as it doesnt get any better than this. . the 5th installment of this game series absolutly leaves you jaw-droping by proving you wrong!",282.5
"its really great game with great music and gameplay!!! 10/10 its genius!",24.4
"civilization v is by far the best video game for those days when time seems boundless and the hour seems listless and one desires nothing but some fun empire building gameplay that no one can get tired of.",433.1

"good ol one more turn game been playing civilization for years an will keep on playing for years especially good ol civilization 5 cant go wrong with buying this great game :)",130.6
"this game is strangley addicting, how ever its is terrible that the dlcs cost as much as the game. other than that, the game itself is great! but the dlc just quadruples on how fun the game is.",20.9
"civ5 isnt nearly as indepth as civ4 and the three expansions, but its really a good thing. late game is a lot more balanced, and the dlc adds some nice scenarios without breaking the bank. all the customization is there, and the hex system makes a nice change of pace.",47.1
"strategic and entertaining. most people are aware of this hexagonal obsessed series but after 77 hours, i can say this is the most addicting addition of the series. noteable strengths: runs well on low end computers. well done economy system each tile has significance and is strategically unique fast pace late game custom maps excelent unit ballance. weaknesses: slow early game long initial loading time ai faction reputations need work. overall a good game well worth buying. if you are looking for an entry to turn based strategy, this would be it. the main thrill peronally was managing my economy and military over a massive spread out faction on a global custom map.",107.4
"a very good time spender. if bored, this will give you fun and absorb your time. very nice and well thought out.",650.6
"one of the best tbs games, but for the series fans it still needs quite a lot tuning. i am really happy that the series is going in the right direction with the new content.",292.0
"probably my second favorite game on the pc. makes you feel important.",356.3
"there are few games that make you feel as in control or powerful as civilization 5 does. it certainly does a fantastic job at what its meant to do and i would recommend this game to you if youre into strategy games and using your wits to best your opposition.",403.2
"this is one of my favorite games on pc, its for every gamer out there.",29.9
"the loss of culture flipping cities is unfortunate, and they simplified cultural victories into simply an offense and defense stat... but still a fine addition to the series.",98.3

"awesome game!! awesome turn based strategy game i absolutely loved it. there is an amazing modding community that can greatly increase the longevity of the game and the mods are supported in steam workshop. i have sunk a ton of hours into this game with abosolutely no regrets. it almost always goes on steam sales so wait until then and snap it up!!",96.4
"the game is simple to pick for new players. on the easiest mode, you cant lose so its nice to just try things and learn by doing -- no thick manual to read. graphics are quite good. great place to see if you like turn-based strategy games (much less stressful than real-time strategy). played almost 200 hours and the replay value is still high. no two games are alike. ive been playing off and on since 2010 and its always fun when i come back to it. even now, i often get sucked into one more turn and stay up later than i planned. if you find yourself winning a lot, changing the difficulty level will change things for you. the game rewards more passive play which i prefer and there are several ways to win (cultural victories are now viable at higher levels). definitely would recommend this game.",214.1
"the most polished version of civilization yet. a must own for anyones library.",162.1
"i absolutely love this game. its hard to stop playing it. if you are looking for an addictive strategy game, this is the game to buy. with so many different types of scenarios and mods you can incorporate, theres literally no end to this game. strategy games were never my cup of tea until this game came along. its hard to point out anything that is being done wrong in this game and the expansions make this game even better.",604.3
"this is a great game that i could play for hours and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to play it.",130.5
"im playing this using my laptop with only the intel hd 4000 so i always play with all the animations turned off. in fact, i always play only using the hexagonal grid map yet i still hours and hours and hours of fun. this game is really that good and this comes from a guy who mainly prefers (action-, j- or just normal) rpgs. the last time i played and enjoyed an rts was aoe ii, waaaay back then. if i could only mention one or two things that absorb me in is the background music, especially when were talking about the middle eastern and the east & south-east asian themes. i love em! not only the music though, the tech tree, policy, units, buildings... there are tons of things that you have to decide, more importantly in the first 100/200 turns, and that what makes this games replayability is unmatched. seeing that this is the only game which ive clocked in for 80+ hours, id rate it 10/10",86.1
"i recommend this game, sadly when i was in sweden... the pirated version is a lot quicker on fixing bugs than the company. i bought two of these games because they did not accept donations and are probably mad that sweden allows pirating.",155.2
"arrgghh... this game and sleep do not combine. hellishly addictive !",121.9

"if you want a strategy, buy this. if you dont, buy this.",338.6
"civilization v is a fun game to get lost in for an hour no better make that ten hours, i found myself consistently playing for long periods of time without even realising it. its not the most realistic out there, but its still something you should all check out.",176.6
"very good time waster game. however can get old quick if you dont have anyone to play with regularly. enjoyed that i could go in and learn a little a bit about each of the leaders and get a bit of learning while playing a strategy game.",97.3
"if you dont want me to nuke your , your going to have to offer more than 10 coins a turn",60.1
"i really like the new civilization. some people were critical because they simplified parts of the game and didnt add anything revolutionary. i think they did a good job of streamlining it while keeping core gameplay elements the same.",104.4
"this has proven to be one of my absolute favourite games. its difficult to put my finger on exactly what is so wonderful about civ v, but i can say that it has the best replayablity value on anything ive ever played. single player is smooth and refined, and every playable civ is perfectly balanced. every map offers a reasonable challenge, and there are multiple ways to win a game. for me, civ v really gets fun in multiplayer with some friends. the multiplayer can be a little touch-and-go, but that was hugely improved in the last few patches. with pitboss multipalyer being run from a stable connection, most of the problems associated with civ vs multiplayer are circumvented. i cannot recommend this game highly enough. if youre waiting to be swayed, get this game. it offers hours upon hours of entertainment.",167.5
"there is no reason why this game shouldnt be in everyones library! this is possibly the most addiciting strategy game ive ever stumbled upon! totally worth paying for! its that perfect blend of military strategy and simulation game. youll be on here for god knows how long when you should be studying for that electronics exam (thats me) buy it!! with the dlcs!",185.1
"one of the most addicting games ive ever played. massive in scale and depth, the game immerses you and makes you want just one more turn every time. turn-based strategy and (optional) very long games prove a challenging and very fun element, if not for everyone, due to its turn-based nature and depth. the ability to save and quit or just walk away and come back to the game at any time is a huge plus for me too.",408.0
"friend got me this, and got me into this, and i like this! :) this is fun.",170.1
"one of the best games ive ever played! great replayability",210.8
"dont be turned off by the fact that this is a turn based game. that was a mistake i made allot of times but now ill never make that same mistake again. i havent played any of the predecessors so it might or not be the best in the series but as a newcomer to civilization this game blew my mind! most definitely a must have!",76.6
"great fun at some points and a tad dry in others. best at sapping away at your day without you even noticing, especially since a standard match tends to last around 15-20 (or more) hours.",85.5
"115 hours logged in this and still not slowing down. ignore the haters still obsessed with 4.",325.3
"if risk or monoply wasnt friendship-destroying enough for you then this may just be the remedy. do you have a lot of friends? like more than john carpenter before he forget what good movies look like? subtract the universe from that list; that is how many friends you will have after just a few short (short: top kek) games of civ 5. you probably be seething with rage from the laughter of your friends as they nuke your capital city, timbucktits, while ghandi is busy railing your mother without a banana. this game will probably push over the edge into a fit of interal rectal hemorraghing, (spelling is for girls). so, i suppose you could say that if you have no friends: then you will probably enjoy this fine title and spend less time fondeling your testicles to grasshat-made, cartoon women and thick-fur-coated, anthropomorphic mammals.",62.8

"warning! please read! this game will suck the life out of you. the concept called taking a break will not work for this game. see how many hours i have on it? those are straight hours without any breaks. all night, no rest, just food. be warned. this game is amazing, and highly fun, and extremely addictive. you cant just play this game for a bit. you cant even just play this game for a while. you can only play it till your spirit is worn out, when your eyes are bloodshot, and when every single part of your  is cramped up. and only then, after you have met the criteria, can you take a break. this game is my jam. but i dont dare play it again, scared that i might die from complete exhaustion. score: 9 1/2 dead sleepless bodies out of 10 dead sleepless bodies. i like pangaea.",13.6
"civ v is one of those games that you want to play a little bit after dinner and then you realize its almost breakfast. with all the expansions, this game is so vast, so varied and with so much written into it you wouldnt even scratch the surface 100 hours of gameplay later. i highly recommend it for people that arent strategy fans too  playing in an lower difficulty still gives you an enjoyable experience from end to end.",132.6

"the ultimate strategy with a huge modding community in steam workshop, if thats your thing. although military victories are ht major type of its kind, the customisation of scenarios and world types are very impressive. leaders are also a great part of it, both historical and comical at the same time. one could describe it as a a chess game(due to hexagonal movements) with more then 2 players and 1000x the amount of complexity. yet the game is still extremely accessible and , well for me, easy to understand. despite this, i recommend to have some experience in strategy games, such as xcom or total war. but if not, there is no better time nor place to start then right here ,right now",123.6
"awesome game. visually beautiful, strategically deep, historically informative, and leads to great stories. the day i bought this, i sat down to learn how to play it after hearing for years how great the civilization series is. when i saved and exited, steam informed me i had 12 hours logged. i paid full price of $30 (1/21/14) and its worth it so far and i suspect will continue to be.",106.1

"amazing strategy game! you can easily sink tons of time on each match and each of the expansions adds a great amount of content. buy this.",82.2
"when civ5 first came out a lot of civ fans cried foul and stayed with 4. with the first expansion though, theres no reason to. the interface is better, its visually appealing, got pretty much all the same features 4 had and its easier to jump into while still being just as complex if you want it to be. if youve been holding out on civ5 because you liked the older ones too much, hold out no more. a great game whether youre a fan of the series of just love strategy games in general. even if you dont, this is a great place to start.",101.2
"civilization takes quite a departure in its fifth installment from its usual design. luckily this works out for the better. the improvements to ui and strategic depth have made civ v the best civ yet. no more stacks of doom and pretty much everything else has been streamlined while retatining the originals strategic depth. i mean, duh come on, its a civilization game. you know you want it.",50.9

"absolutely the best turn-based strategy ever, in my opinion superior to earlier parts... ai in battles could get some tuning, though. i reccomend this game for everyone.",762.0
"by far the one of the best games ive played this generation, civ 5 creates an amayzing turn based tactical system that gives the player complete contol over a civilization of their choice. while most civilizations play relativly the same i found that playing as the american civilization i was better able to keep track of all my cities (as i am american). the most negative thing i can say about the game is that the ai seemes overly aggressive opting almost always to attack the player in full scale war rather than negotiated peace. i found my self all to often with no interest in attacking my neighboring civilizations, than suddendly they declare war on me for no real decinerble reason. if you like turn based stratagy games than pick this game up as fast as you possibly can.",268.6

"this game is amazing as a stand alone but the dlcs add to the experience, sadly the downloadable content is the same price if not slightly more than the game itself for very little added. personaly if you ask me we shouldnt have to pay the same price for the dlcs that we did the game but hey there enjoyable n if you play civalisation v enough they do pay for themselves in playability. so overall the game is great and the dlcs add tones of new units and policies and completly change the way you play, its the perfect game for those who want to build a lasting empire and fend off against power hungry enemys as well as develop a relgus background threw gods and kings dlc to maneging trade routs and protecting them on brave new worlds. no matter your play style you will be challenged",373.8
"wow this game is truly astounding! as a gamer i like variety of games but, i have never been a true fan of turn-based strategy games. i decided to give it a try and now this is all i have played for the past 2 weeks. this game challenges your mind, you can research technology from increasing your military power, scientific knowledge, economics and more. it leaves you wondering should i focus on military incase of attack or focus on economics to expand my empire? it really can kick your  should you choose wrong. overal i give it a 10/10. get it",117.2

"turn based strategy game where you gather resources, build, research, and conquer, ive been a fan of the civilization series since civ i. civilization v is fun, playable, and has better graphics than civ iv, howver, i enjoy the actual gameplay of civ iv more. i dont recommend this, or any other turn based game, for playing with other human players as the turn based nature can make it painfully slow.",154.1
"seriously amazing game; improves on the series in every way. one unit per turn is a hot topic, but imho makes the game less tedious. strategy must-have; this is the current 4x benchmark.",483.4

"wanna have a strategic ? there you go! civilization v probably the best multiplayer-based strategic videogame we have on the market. a bit rough to start, but smooth as ice when it comes to dropping nukes on your enemies or pillaging enemys trade routes. you will find yourself using ultimate strategies in a few days. the game isnt as close to reality as it seems on the first look. for example, how do you research archery into the wheel? still, it is a great world-simulation to play with your friends. you should stay on your friends side, when it comes to 10-player multiplayer game and then backstab them with no harm. as far as ive seen, the dlc-s are also worth getting. the price is a bit high, but when you already have a scouting badge, you probably should get one.",38.4

"this is good...but only really addicting with all the expansion packs.",461.0
"by far one of the best strategy games ive ever played. if you like to macro manage on a national scale and build up an empire to crush your enemies this is your game. although, if you are not normally interested in strategy based games this is not the game for you. the gameplay is turn-based but the pace of the game hides this fact, this is a good thing. many people ive talked to share the same experience, you decide you want to play a quick game one night for just an hour or so and you end up looking at the clock and it is 2 a.m. some people dont think this is true, but it is. this game will chomp up your time for a couple of days after purchase. but maaaaaaaan will you enjoy it. if you decide to buy this awesome game have fun.",366.3

"do you like civilizations?! do you like warfare?! do you like firing nukes without repercussions?! if you answered yes to any of the above, read on. if not... read on anyway. i might be able to persuade you. civilization v is nothing like the previous incarnations of the series. except for the overall gameplay, most of the features have changed. leaders have been done away with, and all nations have only one leader. religion has been greatly expanded upon with the gods & kings expansion, and theres a new world congress feature to replace the un in brave new world. that being said, while this is a great game by itself, the unpatched version without the dlc and expansionpacks is inferior to civilization iv in terms of content. if youre planning to pick this up, get it with the dlc or at the very least the expansions. it should give you, at the veyr least, a few hours of amusement.",126.7
"the most refined and elegant civilization yet. a must have!",23.4

"great game the game just keeps moving on and you got to try to be ahead",144.6
"one of, if not the, best civ games to come out. the updated combat system make the game more interesting. also the dlc is well worth it. just make sure you dont have anything that needs to be done in the near future once you make the plunge! ...one more turn...",105.0

"i dont know much about the civilization series as a whole but i have played civilization revolution (i know some dont consider it apart of the series) on the xbox 360 and the game stays true to what it is all about, that one more turn addiction, and single matches that can go on for weeks to months. i highly recommend this game to fans of strategy with the new hexes instead of the usual average tiles and the elimination of stacking units. to fans of the series you probably already bought it and to those who arent particularly a fan of strategy still try the demo im sure youll find something good on it that will keep you hooked.",159.7
"this is by far the best game i picked up during the summer sale. i didnt think i would enjoy it very much, but its been a blast. even though the majority of the gameplay is clicking text boxes and moving along a map--its strangely engrossing and extremely compelling. if you enjoy turn based games this game will likely entertain you for hundreds of hours. put history in a blender, hit puree, and see what comes out.",214.4
"this is a great tbs and is very addictive, a must have for strat fans!",366.3
"this is the most addictive game know to humanity and i cant stop playing. its like turn based grand strategy for dummies. its really easy to learn, theres an infinite amount of replayability, it has brilliant multiplayer so as this game is easy to learn and the interface makes the gameplay and management fast you can just tell any one of your friends to buy this game and play it with you. id also like to point out that as i said this is turn based but theres a magnificent option which allows you to have hybrid turns which means that you play your turns simultaineously unless youre at war with an another player, in that case the other players still take turns at the same time. 10/10 buy immediately.",142.5
"a good strategy game unfortunatley kinda falls short to its predecessor without the brave new world expansion but with it, its much better.",432.1
"im not going to review this game because basically everyone i know has it. im still debating whether or not its better than civ 4. after giving it some thorough playthroughs, im giving the edge to civ v, with its sharper graphics, cities that dont get roflstomped by one guy, non do-or-die combat, more interesting civics, more interesting leader powers. i miss leonard nimoy and the built-in world builder option though, as well as some of the classical songs. :(",239.3
"what you have here is the cleanest, best looking, smoothest playing, most tactically enjoyable version of the deepest and most addictive strategy game of all time. -cvg magazine. +1",32.4
"i would highly reccomend this game to any intellgient hardcore gamer. it opened a world of strategy games to me, and i am so grateful for that. before this game i had never played rts or tbs gmaes, and this was accessible enough for me to undertsnad it, but complex enough to challenge me. and whiile it is not overwhelming, the better you get the more complex you can make the game so it doesnt get boring with exerience, this is a genius masterstroke of game making. i can say with complete confidence that this is by far the best turn based strategy game of all time, and it is in my top 5 strategy games, wich is impressive because every other strategy game in my top 10 is rts.",374.3
"gets a bad rep, though not always unwarranted. that said, the latest expansion makes it significantly more playable, and i cant go back to stacks of doom.",84.3

"this is the utimate turn-based stategy around, it does have slight problems though,as sometimes the a.i can go on the fritz during a invasion of your country but worth every penny. p.s its dlcs are worth picking up as g&k and bnw improve the experience by vast amounts.",177.5

"sid meiers civilization v: 9.0 / 10.0 pros: -the hexagonal tiles are amazing! -only one unit is allowed per tile. this eliminates clutter. -no more stacking units into armies. this was time consuming and tedious (imo). -the combat is better for the most part. the only real negative is that units do the same amount of damage regardless of how many of their individuals soldiers are alive. -for the most part, upgraded archers can no longer shoot planes out of the sky, and swordsmen can no longer decimate tanks. -an abundance of unique civilizations to choose from. -the research tree is awesome. -city states are a great addition to the series. -cities are no longer easy to conquer. when fighting rome, i had to use two nuclear warheads, 5 upgraded bombers, and a unit of tanks to take it down. cons are in the comment section.",82.6

"this game gets 0/10 budder blocks hail sky. its full of a bunch of squids who think they can run a country. they also dont let you mine budder and make shrines to lord sky. this needs a remake or a dlc to add budder and move it up to my standards hail sky",80.2
"5 out of 5 stars. easily the best pc strategy game, even for being a few years old now. civ 5 is a legendary game that includes so many strategic decisions to be made. the multiplayer is always fun, and the singleplayer is not bad also. would recommend to anyone of any experience level with pc gaming.",597.5
"screw this game. its too addicting. i go play this game thinking ill just spend a few hours on friday night playing this game. next thing i know, its sunday night not knowing where the hell did my weekend go. its a game where you say to yourself one more move... turns to two hundred more moves and six hours later. i literally started this game at 7pm and next thing i knew, it is 5am and only had 1 hour of sleep until i had to get ready for work. btw, screw ghandi. do not make peace with him. he will always make war with you.",13.9

"some could say civilization v is the greatest turn based strategy games in years, i would agree. this game makes you think before you act and one wrong decision could cost you the game. for example you could opt for a full out military assualt on an empire that you think you outnumber or just have more technology then but after years and years of bloodshed you find yourself backed up against a wall with no one to save you, maybe you should of peaced out while you had the chance? maybe you shouldnt of started the war in the first place and went along your merry way. this is what civilization is all about, yes it might look simple on the outside or boring, but everyone who is a fan of turn based strategy games will understand how amazing this game really is. definitely reccomend",145.5

"ive never been much of a strategy game person, but this and xcom: enemy unknown really changed that. this game is a little rough around the edges without the brave new world and gods & kings expansions. i highly recommend both of those to get an extremely complete and well rounded game. as the saying goes: one more turn. as you can see i have spent well over 700 hours on this game and i have enjoyed almost every moment of it. i always seems to fall back into and and just enjoy the game play. the game also has a very good amount of history you can learn from in just by reading the built-in wiki. i have since taken up an interest in history, just due to this game. there are just so many things i can write about this game, but i think the best thing i can really say is you should try it for yourself. i am sure you will enjoy it, especially if you are already into strategy games!",813.1

"love it, enjoying it more than total war series. politics, strategy and religion are much more important than just making an army.",61.5
"ok sid this game is nice and all but youre not getting any of those dlc funbux from me until multiplayer ing works",36.5
"beautiful game. i play this for hours and hours without losing interest. sid meiers games are one of a kind.",272.6
"just buy it now, play it for a bit, then look at time played! enjoy :d",148.3
"4 **** i struggle to understand a lot of civs concepts but i can recognize a good game when i see it. this title has a lot going for it, its better than 4 in my opinion. so if you like this sort of thing give it a go.",75.2
"so. good. streamlined nicely for casual players, but fully capable of supporting advanced players. the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay immersive and guaranteed to make you keep uttering the phrase thats practically the series trademark: just one more turn until three in the morning. if youre at all interested in turn-based strategy youve just found its crown. play it.",239.7
"great game. just make sure you get the expansions.",296.3
"awesome, and even more awesome way to game with mod enhancements. many ways to alter ur view of play.",691.5
"this game is really cool.shows alot of potential and is work into it.i reccomend this game to everyone that likes stragety games.",178.2
"pretty darn good game. gameplay is smooth and responsive and the ai is pretty intelligent. i like the idea of running a civilization and being able to conquer others. only thing is the dlc is expensive.",89.5
"you play as the undisputed dictator of your own nation in this fantastic national socialist germany simulator, you win can through other methods like diplomacy but thats no fun.",53.7
"excellent turn-based strategy. its like risk, monopoly, and simcity combined.",108.2
"just one more turn, one more campaign i swear... (6 hours later). not recommended for low-end computers, as late-game turn processing can make the game lag and heat up your computer. definitely play dx11 mode if you can handle it though, its much prettier to look at and you get animated world leaders.",221.5
"i highly recommend this game, one match could keep you entertained for hours!",142.9
"great game, played for years. as soon as i tried to utilize the steam cloud functions though, the entire thing crashed. now, every time i try to load or save a game the program crashes to desktop. ive been in communication with steam support for 9 days now and they keep giving me the runaround with solutions that are not affecting my problem at all. 2k support didnt even bother responding to my request. whats more, right before all this happened i encouraged two friends to buy this game, now i cant play with them at all. im terribly vexed.",276.0
"i think the civilization series is great. overall i give it a 8/10 concept: same as other civilzations, 7/10 gameplay: outstanding at how many options there are! 8/10 graphics: incredable: 10/10 price: waaaaaaaay too pricy,but thats what happens to big company games. wait a couple of years it will go down though.",77.7
"i think i permanently damaged my right arm by playing this game.",134.9
"the brave new world expansion basically saved this game. it fixed all the issues i had with the base game. both diplomacy and the latter half of the game has been given a tremendous face lift. civ v is now on par with, if not more fun than, civ iv.",182.3
"the endless possibilities, scenarios, and beautifal gameplay make civ 5 an easy game to lose hundreds of hours in. smart and stylish civ 5 will can make burning the midnight oil easy. it really does embody all the greatest things about the franchise and the expansion packs fill in all the wholes left in the original game. highly recommend this title.",270.0
"a board game that could only exist as a video game, with an immense amount of depth. its easy to play and almost impossible to master, and its a different game every time you play it. pick up both major dlcs (brave new world and gods and kings) for the best possible experience.",70.4
"one last turn! fans of the civlization franchise have been screaming since the series inception and civ v is no exception. with many mechanics being overhauled and refined, every bit of the game is even better than the predecessor. fan or not you must check out this game, for it will consume your life (in the best way possible of course).",24.6
"for strategy nerds, history nerds and anyone who wishes to see wild inaccuracies in history just for teh lulz (the aztecs conquering the french? who knew?) its a great timesink for anyone craving strategy. its good for newbies and experts alike, ranging between i can do this to the ai is straight up cheating a personal favorite thing about this game is that it plays in turns (so you can watch some tv or whatever and wont lose because you got distracted) and that it doesnt require precise controls, making it perfect for playing in a laptop without external mice or keyboards",188.0
"culture, science, religion... gold.. these are the stuff of civilization. an excellent marriage of strategy, turn-based combat, and resource managment. lose sight of your civilizations goal... and neighbouring leaders may leave you in the dust. leaders come and go... cities crumble... so too will the tangible relationships of your family and friends as you whisper to yourself just one more turn",66.9
"great game. it will ruin your life. seriously, buy this.",438.2
"civ 5 is one of the greatest games i have ever played!!!",130.3
"extremely addicting, so many different options and sceneros to play over and over again.",46.1
"amazing and strategic. i always say  uh why does my friend wanna play this game? but when i actually get on , i cant get off. ive played 2 games till the end and ive had 25 hours on record. amazing game , must buy.",104.9
"similar to other strategy turn based games, ai not too bright sadly. however, overall, worth playing. - 8.5/10",688.6
"ive had this game for over a year and i still spend hours playing it. great buy.",718.1
"civ 5 is a game that holds up for years before itll lose its luster. everytime i get bored between games i fall back on civ 5. so many maps and dif civilizations with alot of random elements makes this a must have for almost any gamer who enjoys turn-based strategy games. +the different difficultys/victory conditions/skirmish style battles makes it a very replayable game, that youll enjoy game after game. i would rank it an 8/10.",592.8
"its rare to play the latest game in a long-lived family of sequels and not think about features you hope the next version has or bugs the next iteration will avoid. civilization v is, for my money, the apex of the genre.",335.7
"fantastic game, literally nothing wrong with it. games take ages to finish, but this means nothing when youre enjoying yourself this much. i cant recommend this game enough.",83.5
"a definite game to buy for those that like both easy and hard strategy games, the mods make the game even more fun than it already is. although the multiplayer could be implemented btter, everything else is great and i do recommend this game.",375.6
"best stratedgy game ever. this game is a must in your library :d",220.9
"very great strategic war game its almost like real life and there is lots of dlc for it.",50.5
"addictive and very intense! recommend to anyone who likes strategy gamess",156.6
"if you dont like my civ v, i dont want to know you.",70.4
"this game was absolute brilliance. it was countless hours of strategy and something you can sit down and think about your next move. excelent.",245.1
"definatly worth a try. confusing at first, but when you know what to do, is incredibly addictive, and entertaining when playing with friends.",334.8
"great game, the map packs are silly but all the other dlc is great.",18.3
"get brave new world then play 10/10 best game love it, bye bye. :*",211.8
"thsi is easily one of the best strategy games ive ever played",456.8
"awesome game. from a good series but a warning it is a day eater.",98.7
"each civ game adds enough features to give the feeling of a new game, while still holding onto the civilization familiarity that weve all loved for decades.",568.1
"a wonderful way to spend a full weekend with friends. immersive gameplay and fun for hours.",456.7
"if you liked the previous games this one is just another stepping stone in civilization.",1.7
"beware, this game is brutally addictive! only buy and play if you have the time and are prepared to lose it. civilization v is one of those games that is surprisingly easy to learn, but difficult to master. every feature from warfare, economics, spying or politics is fun and lets you lead your country to victory on your own terms. when it comes to turn-based strategy games, they dont come any better than this.",25.7
"awesome game. hours of fun with tons of replayability.",72.7
"civ v is one of the best computer games i have ever played. the 2 dlcs, g&k and bnw, are totally worth buying. they both change the game a lot but it is in a good way. the amount of community mods that are aviable are exceptional. they add a ton of great content and make the game even better. i would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.",73.5
"awesome game. it is definetly something you have to play as a gamer who loves strategy and economics.",140.8
"just 5 more turns... just a few more turns. just one more turn. alright, ill finish this research then im done for the night. just one more turn. ok, i really should stop... after this turn. ill save and ill close the game - after this turn. its 6am and im still playing, after this turn i should probably go to sleep... ive lost control of my life im ed.",116.3
"far too often has been the cause of 6am bedtimes. fantastic",50.6
"good game if u like turn based rts games but get all the dlc as the original is balls",113.8
"if you love stratagy, city building, and crafting your own empire, you will not be dissapointed 10/10",101.4
"civ v is a really good game for those strategic, thinking gamers out there. and you dont even need a knowledge of world history because you create it! yes, i know its not an indefinite amount of possibilities (though that is a drawback for some people) it has a bunch of other things. the original game only has a certain amount of civilizations, though, so if you have enough, buy it with an expansion (or two) and as many dlcs as you can afford, because i assure you it is worth it. i would give this a 9/10 because of my tastes. i mean, i love the game, but as a game you control without an indefinite amount of possibilities, i am one of the many people who find that a drawback. other than that, its an amazing game!",45.9
"very easy to get sucked into. i end up playing for hours on end whenever i start this game up, and its well worth thirty dollars.",138.6
"if youre bored and need something to do for a couple of weeks, civ 5 is the game you need",28.4
"want to start a game at 7am, look at your clock and think about maybe going to bed at 3am, realizing you just fastforwared through time? buy it. buy it for a friend. travel through time together.",32.9
"oh this game is the bomb! other than the lag on multiplayer this game is beast!",112.5
"very fun and addictive. it has a lot a replay value and the workshop extends it even further. the dlc is also fun and worth it.",80.5
"ive played all of the civilization games. but this game upd the bar once again. it will keep you glued to your screen. graphics 4/5 gameplay 5/5",95.9
"this game, even without its dlc, is absolutely phenomenal. how many other games let you progress from men with pointy sticks all the way to the nuclear age, while juggling your empires growth and spread, citizen happiness, resources, culture, diplomatic relationships with other civilizations and technological advances? and thats before you get into its dlc which adds tourism, religion, espionage and trade routes. the only flaw is how long it takes to play a game.",134.2
"sid meiers civilization v is a triumph in pc gaming. there is no other turn-based strategy game of its kind. civ v is the most balanced, complex (in a good way), in-depth and addicting pc game i may have ever played. this game oozes the just one more turn mentality and is hard to stop playing. with a plethora of races/civs to choose from, this title offers an uncanny amount of replayability. trust me, this game is a must have.",867.3
"it is an amazing game that lets you create a civilization and help along as it goest through ancient era to postmodernism. the huge number of civilizations lets every game become unique and the great music lets you be immersed in the civilization that you are carving.",39.6
"this game is amazing. it is sooo funif you buy it buy all the expansions too!!!!!",226.6
"like the era that go by in this game so wil the hours in your day, if you play this....",167.1
"excellent replay value. great old school multiplayer through giant multiplayer robot (dont use pitboss unless youre a masochist). solid turn based strategy.",481.6
"this game has endless replayability. i cant stop playing it. love the graphics too.",239.3
"the new dlc god an king save this soft, coz he dont deserve this price",643.3
"good, and a great time killer, play as any world leader, from ghandi, to washington",108.0
"even after playing this game since it was released im still finding out new things about it, and the mods sure can make it alot funnier. have yet to try the multiplayer, as im still pretty happy with the singleplayer ai. if you like turn based strategy games you, wont be disappointed buying this one.",159.8
"you know what it is. turn-based strategy at its finest. civilization v is the strongest inducer of the one more turn syndrome ive ever encountered. first turn, you settle your first city. hundreds of turns later, youre tired, aching, and hungry while you wage war with persia, japan, and greece. civ v is an excellent game.",331.1
"an incredibly diverse turn based strategy game that will glue you to your computer for hours on end.",381.6
"epic game, can take your time and work out strategies that make you think",524.9
"this is an incredibly detailed strategy game with seemingly endless options available and a very broad scope. a single game can easily comprise 10 hours of gameplay and you can build a truly vast empire with an ever growing number of needs which need to be managed! its suprisingly easy to learn the basics of the game given its extreme complexity, but experienced players can become more effective as they learn the game in greater detail. unfortunately longer games can become a little stagnant at times but this might have something to do with my own attention span after playing the game for several hours! still, i would call this a must buy for any strategy fans and one of the better games to introduce new players to the genre; civilization has always been at the forefront of strategy gaming in my mind and this is no exception.",145.0
"great game, can lose a whole day playing it though",51.5
"ah, civ v. kind of disapointing in the feature it lacked compared to iv, but has made itself up for that in the two main dlc so far. the first one got up to nearly par with iv and the second surpassed it. i also love the combat more by making unit groups more important than just stacking a bajillion units in one stack. mind you, you still needed artillery, but you get the idea. it is a much more interesting system when it involves more around units specifics. id suggest this to any 4x lover.",337.3
"think board game without the messy packing and maintaining of pieces. think semi-intelligent, competitive ais. think age of empires and empire earth rolled into one, minus rts. time consuming, but when it comes down to pitboss (turn based multiplayer you can come back to any time), youll keep going, one more turn! this is a game for you if you excel at planning and predicting other players moves. just think chess that includes worker pieces, and against up to 31 other players.",61.2
"ive been playing civ v for quite some time with friends, and while it has a few glaring problems like  ai that runs units to their death in your citys with no chance of taking it and gandhi and his opness. its otherwise a great time vampire more so with all the xpacks adding sorely needed features like religions in gods and kings and actual trade networks in brave new world. if you have tens of hours to drop into a game per setting this is the game for you as hours just disappear before you know it, you start playing at 3pm and in the blink of an eye its 1am.",194.7
"one of the best of the civ series so far. the game is beautiful. the gameplay suffers in a few areas but the game is very playable. if you play civ at all this is a must buy as well as the new expansion for it. it adds a lot of new things to make the core game much better.",4.7
"better than civ 4 so far. no more unit stacking makes military victories easier. culture rush is nerfed. even cities without any units can bombard barbarians. no more transports needed to travel overseas is very nice. no more religions. the social policies are simpler too. a-",80.6
"awsome game and has hundreds of hours of replayability",499.8
"civilization v is an amazing real time strategy that i personally recomend for all levels of gaming but i agree that this game is a good choice to play.",12.3
"just 1 more turn never seems to be enough when playing any civ game, and this one is no exception. great gameplay, with new hex maps and different twists on ideas from the older civ games. cant go wrong with this one.",261.9
"look, ive played this series since civilization ii back in the day of pixel sprites and beatles music. civ v, the latest installment is great. the base game is sort of lackluster compared to the complexities of civ iv, but gandk and bnw (the expansions) help to flesh out the gameplay and give it that true civ feel. do i recommend? yes, i do. a/5.",389.9
"it is the peak of the series of great strategy from sid meiers it has gone from avarage to best civ game i have played since 4 with its 2 addons that are must for the ultimate experience. you can spend hundreds of hours to this guaranteed if you like almost any strategy.",117.4
"ghandi is a , atilla is cheap, and washington is a  douche",138.4
"for some reason no matter how many times i repeat this game, it never gets old. everyone i know who has played it, including me has loved it. just buy it when it goes on sale.",31.4
"sid meiers civilization v is amazing. this game lets you create your own story, and you create your own history of your own world. when i play this game im not just watching the screen, but im there in the game itself. civilization has economy, culture, technology, a believable world, and a military that has an advance developed game of chess feel to it. the possibilities are endless, and so is the gameplay. brandon m.",289.4
"addicting and simple turn based strategy that will turn you into an aggressive realist the second your ai opponents stop playing nice.",114.4
"i am having major issues openning this program and tech support is non helpful..waste of my money",317.7
"this game is amazing and the expansions make it even better, not as deep as civ 4 but the great modding community makes the game almost infinite in its replaybillity also very good bro-op game if you have a weekend (or a few years)",71.1
"easy to get into, hard to leave. this game will keep you hooked for hours on end as you try to conquer all the lands around you. ( alexandar the great,  will attack you fast). simple compared to the other civs, doesnt detract from the fun. a must play with friends.",266.3
"first i was a littel skeptical about the game. but then i tried it, and i been hook for 11 hours in one day.",123.5
"not as complex as civ iv, but with considerably better combat tactics, improvements in gameplay mechanics in many respects. this game is better than civ iv. its still complex and intelligent, more accessible than its predecessor and every bit as fun.",659.3
"i dont know what to call civ v. id call it boring, but you can seriously look up and go wait whered the last 6 hours go? i wish i knew more people that played it though.",22.8
"i have spent many an hour glued to my keyboard because of this game. too addictive. it is espesially a danger to those that have things to do.",95.5
"its great if you have a weekend with nothing else to do, doesnt require a lot of concentration so you can put real effort into trolling your opponants :d",300.0
"if you are looking for a completely immersive experience that will consume hours of your time, this is your game.",695.8
"the phrase time flies when youre having fun, can never be fully understood until one plays this game. sit back, start a game, and watch two weeks fly by like nothing.",536.3
"strategy smart game lots of civilizations good sound",7.5
"sometimes i spend >8 hours playing this at a time, my butt hurts after that. definatly 10/10",127.2
"the most detailed and complex civ yet. absolutely awesome!",232.0
"great single player, the multiplayer is epic. i wish you could form alliances though... 8/10",37.6
"when i play i cant stop. it has ruined my life. my wife has left me and i cant see my children anymore. i havent been outside in 2 weeks. 4/5",67.6
"fantastic turn based strategy game. i actually before tbs to rts, as i enjoy considering every externality over reacting. get this with brave new world and gods and kings. it really makes the game fantastic.",152.8
"fantastic game! you can sit down and play what you think is 5 min and look outside and its dark its so imercive",180.3
"have you ever wanted to  and pillage the countryside as the mongol hoards and play settlers of catan at the same time? really? wow, you are ed. but here you go!",66.2
"i set up a game to reinact ww2. it was an 8 player game with the chinese, japanese, germans, russians, polish, americans, british and i played the french. i minded my own business until just before the modern era, the germans unloaded a full scale assault on paris. i wasnt surprised. everything was going according to plan until the americans backstabbed me at orleans. it was completely uncalled for. the historical inaccuracies really bring this game down from a 10/10 to a 5/10. would not recommend ever playing the french. much betrayal, such conspiracy, so war.",167.7
"time consuming but incredibly fun strategy game which has the ability to take hours and make them feel like minutes.",66.2
"1-unit per tile replaces tedious unit stacking with something similar to a tactics rpg. policies are an excellent new feature, adding more fuel to the 1-more-turn-fire. diplomacy still not believable, with ais to hard to please. ai is still not a human, not vrey bright tactically. beautiful. overall, still the best 4x strategy series, made better with steam and modder community merge.",55.3
"this is a fun entertaining game bilt for people that love civilization based games.",141.4
"while civilization v introduces a whole new hexagonal/no-unit-stacking system which may alienate some of the veterans of earlier civ games, the shift also introduces a new challenge for these veterans to master. getting the gods & kings add-on also brings a revamped religion aspect to the game, as well as a whole new batch of civilizations to master. join the fray with your favorite.",183.8
"everybody go and throw money at it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",234.1
"a great strategy game for all ages. i strongly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys watching something grow over a long period of time. the graphics are good, a.i. is great and the diversity is fantastic. though it takes a lot of patience, it is a great game when you have developed your civilisation. 9.5/10",39.0
"one of the best strategy games i have ever played. its very addicting too. its a must have!",248.2
"this is one of the best games i have ever played! although, for the best of it, you do need all the big dlc. so if i was you i would wait for the gold edition to be on a good sale. it is not as complicated as some other grand strategy games, but still really fun. play the multiplayer with friends if you can, although it can be buggy and crash, so make sure your autosave is on!",540.2
"the base gsme is good but with the expansion brave new world it is amazing",73.3
"very good game :) , tutorial is boring, unintuitive and wordy though.",166.0
"epic turn based strategy game from one of the if not the biggest series in the genre. the newest update doesnt disappoint! and who doesnt love montezumas unique style of crazy?",275.1
"a great continuation of the civ series, i love it!",168.0
"from civ- games series this is the best one in the league!",280.2
"ok first thing first i have played this for over 500 hours good grief. i love this game and must say do not play if you want free time you will not have any.",600.4
"it has a lot of replayability and is pretty good mini hitler simulator. seems pretty balanced, all in all. nukes dont feel nearly as devestating as they should be - late game on a warrior run i tend to toss them out like vowels in a sentence and i never feel like as big a monster as i should be. has the steam workshop too so you have even more crap to stuff in when you run out of love for the vanilla stuff. gods and kings is pretty balanced save for the initial pantheon powers (you have a choice between +10% population growth and other stuff like +1 production - so needless to say, there is no reason to take 90% of what is on the list because there are one or two things that offer bonuses that will actually mean anything late game). still, nothing shattering or bad.",293.1
"if you like the civ games buy this with the expansions and have a hundred hours of fun",276.7
"this is a fantastic game, would recommend for any fan of strategy.",24.1
"fun time burning game :) awesome to play with friends.",306.1
"a fantastic time sink - with the bnw expansion i think it finally can be said that it eclipses iv as the premier in the series. while some may disagree due to the added depth from the earlier edition, i feel as though the much improved combat system pushes v to the top.",169.3
"well thought out and beautiful looking strategy game.",101.7
"i love it so much! it has so much stratergy and risk taking i love it!",247.7
"spent endless hours on this. its my first venture in to the civ games but it sure was a nice experience. learning different ways to play has been enjoyable and the dlc and expansions make it a really fun game with friends or on your own :)",180.8
"best civilization so far, apart from maybe the original. dlcs certainly improve the game and make it very competitive and interesting to play. shame i dont have more free time to spend hours on it. for newcomers to the series, expect a steep learning curve, especially when trying higher difficulty settings, but keep going and youll have years of fun. large and active modding community brings new elements to it every day.",211.7
"i sugjest buying it know because its christmas. its not getting cheaper over time",251.3
"civilization v is a huge step forward in the strategy genre. 11/10, 3 thumbs up!",295.5
"i could play this game every day of my life until i died, and id still want to play more.",75.7
"overall i enjoy civ series and this brings a new twist as no longer able to stack units. definitely adds some new challenges to the series.",408.9
"recently picked up brave new world, and i must say the civ franchise just keeps getting better, and better, and better. i have probably logged more hours of civilization in all its incarnations than any other franchise, and i heartily recommend it to anyone with a decent attention span, especially if they enjoy history!",533.0
"most fun when played collaboratively with friends. good luck keeping track of what the hell you were planning in the half-dozen youll have going at once, based on whos available a particular night.",69.3
"this is possibly the most awesome game ive ever bought. seriously. you can jump in without ever having played the other civilization games, as it has a full tutorial. there is masses of dlc you can download. though that being said, you can play the game a thousand times, and itd be different every time - so the dlc isnt necessary to enjoy the game.",179.1
"very good game just dont play as enrico dandolo (venice) unless you want a challenge",239.0
"dont play this game it will consume all your time like it has mine",323.1
"its a challenging game, but i wish more people played this. after playing for hours and hours i just want to test the game with other people...but its really rare to find enough players at a given time and even more difficult to play an entire match.",26.3
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",20.5
"good stratagy game, and a good time sink. always find myself playing longer than i thought i would. if you like other civ games you will like this one",89.2
"this is the strategy game to own although the matches take a very long time to finish (up to 2-3 days) its well worth it every match is different. there is almost no glitches what so ever so its a very smooth game to play and a wide vareity of things to do",150.2
"best turn based strategy game i have ever played. great game and diplomacy mechanicsi indeed worth it. :)",593.9
"civ 5; a bundle of sleepless fun, concentration, mistrust, and an unhealthy (yet effective) amount of instant coffee.",44.9
"a very enjoyable turn-based strategy game. a quick game of civ has ruined many lan parties by taking up all our time.",35.8
"it feels like i just lost 20 hours overnight, and i loved every second. ready for another go and its only been a few days. this is addiction.",27.2
"i absolutely recommend this game. its as hard as you want it to be, and always keeps you wanting more - what if youd done this, or changed your view on something? this game lets you be whatever and who you want to be.",97.9
"i had fun with it, the dlc adds some new experiences, though i think theyre overpriced, end rant, i liked it",333.6
"a truly wonderful game that lets you play around with history. its a great game youll deffinately have fun playing.",83.3
"civilization v is a huge technological jump over its predecessor. as a standalone vanilla game, its pretty solid and enjoyable. with add-ons gods and kings and brave new world, it becomes a masterpiece in the 4x/turn based genre. great game that will easily wrap up your time and get you hooked before you even realize it as finishing up one more task before you save the game and quit, turns into another hour.",19.9
"another brilliantly addicting romp through history, sid meiers civilization v builds on the past successes of the franchise and gives a whole new level of detail and gory gregarious beauty. for a real good time, play in slow mode and watch as the world passes you by.",86.1
"love the game, feels much more simple than other civ games though.",66.8
"my all time favourite game, strategy that is really easy to get into.",216.2
"civ is an odd game. to someone with no knowledge of ancient civilizations, its mystifying, having dozens set out before you. but its great. and dont think, because its a bit confusing, youre getting flung in at the deep end. there are highly intuitive controls, and great tutorials (totally optional). i seriously recommend this game, and hope that you get it at some point.",115.8
"its really fun if you have time on your hands. its better if you have friends to play with.",50.3
"i didnt thought it would be possible to make civ v better, but bnw redefined what an expension should be. an exemple for a lot of games !",322.0
"the most addictive game on this side of alpha centauri! seriously, this game is great and you should get it.",389.9
"ive been playing civ since it first came out. this version works well with steam and on the mac. the units and action are enjoyable. lots of content included in the basic version. theres a slew of downloadable content. my only complaint are some interface bits that could be better explained. looking forward to downloading all of the dlcs.",12.9
"great game hour of fun and i cant stop playing it when i do play it and i cant find much that i dont like it",117.4
"good fun, but is significantly better with expansions, especially bnw. good variety of difficulties; from derpy for newcomers to complex for experts.",175.6
"you should know whether or not you like civ games by now. if you liked civ 2, civ 3, and civ 4, civ 5 is more of the same. the series gradual flow towards simplification, polish, and tightening come to a new apex in civ 5. the new hex system has improved combat significantly, the city-states give diplomats something to do, and the whole ui is so much cleaner that - in my opinion - civ 5 is the first civ game that you can use to really introduce someone new to the series. while firaxis stubbornly refuses to release an alpha centauri 2, civ 5 is going to have to be my current large-scale strategy fix.",224.6
"just an awesome game make sure you have atleast gods and kings.",74.6
"a good way to kill time, enjoyable, plain awesome...worth",119.1

"super solid game. excellent for casual players as well as for those who like to go into more depth. on of the best value for money games i think you can buy and i have thoroughly enojoyed playing it.",133.9
"if youre a civ 3 and/or civ 4 veteran like me, youll enjoy this new version of an old addiction. some elements simplified others expanded on. i boycotted buying this game until a friend of mine made me play it. most dynasty games dissapoint, this one does not.",165.2
"one of the best strategy games invented i have spent most of my life playing this, and every second has been worth it.",228.4
"when i login to play anything, this is usually what i want to play. there is something so satisfying about playing civ v. every game you play will be different so the replay value is off the charts. fantastic game all around.",353.4
"great game! ive spent counless hours playing this game and plan on spending many more!",276.1

"this game is so good i can not explain it just go get the demo and find out for yourself",397.4
"fun game good time sink, can be hard to get into at first and learn everything. if you like in depth stragty games go for it",60.3
"i could play this game for hours on end and never get bored. very great game.",217.1
"easily my favorite game, even before the addition of g&k and bnw. there are just so many different ways of playing, and each time you play, something new happens. evey time you make a move the opposing nations respond in kind. you get to pick a civilization and guide it through history to whatever end you decide. you are in control of all aspects of your nation, from culture to military strategy, scientific research to religion, and city location to resource managment.",193.6
"this game is like viagara,serioulsy,this game is so addictive that my balls sweat everytime i play it because i dont shower in a week. the game is like the ultimate fantasy(gandhi nuking the aztecs or washington bombing the mongols.). play this game now",154.3

"its really good. edit: after rolling over too many hours playing this... and i still dont have the latest expansion... its still really good.",650.9
"great game to play on your own or with friends. while i still think civ 4 is better, civ 5 still holds its own and gives me hours of great gameplay.",540.3
"only one thing about this game that i can say. it is amazing!!! the graphics are awesome and let me tell you my graphics card and processor are horrible but this still runs very well, even on higher graphic settings. each game can will take you a good amount of time to complete and if you want all the achievments youll be at this a long time. each game is different so youll need to work out a different strategy each time. all the different dlc adds so much to the game (in my opinion they are a little overpriced so i reccommend buying the game of the year edition off of amazon) and wait for a sale to get brave new world and gods & kings.",38.4
"great game, i will invariably spend hours on this game in the future with my mates.",176.2
"i think civ 5 is the best game ive ever played. on any console. period. which is a big ask when youre going up against killer instinct from the original gameboy...i digress. civ 5 is simply amazing. replayability is endless. the mechanics are flawless (well, probably. i couldnt think of a single way to improve it). the combat is exciting and the strategies are many and varied. its hands down the best turn-based strategy game ever, and even in its 5th installment still has new innovations that just improve on what was already a great series. i have sunk so many hours into this game, the only drawback is that you will have many sleepless nights and bleary mornings if you install this game. but if there ever was a game that justified sleepless nights and bleary mornings, then this is it.",499.0
"i have 170 hours on this game and it is worth the money! good graphics and fun/strategic gameplay",220.4
"amazing game that i would recomend to everyone. everytime i play its for a couple hundred turns before a break. definitely worth it.",24.2
"awesome game that is extremely accessible to newer players. really reccomend this game as it is a great buy. furthermore, the game is much better with dlc, however the vanilla game is pretty good too. finally, this game has mod compatability which is awesome.",214.2

"if you enjoy the game of risk and world domination you will love this game and i will be more than happy to test your strategic methods in an epic battle to the death",238.5
"gamer is so good it makes you punch your own face.",123.8
"massively addicting. several time i started a game with just a few hours to spare and ended up staying up until 4am for just one more turn... i really like the change to one military unit per tile and the hexagon tile system. alot of the systems from civilization iv have been migrated over and tweaked. the only real negative is that there have been more bugs with civ v than i experienced playing civ iv, but in all fairness i did start playing iv after it had a few expansions. the latest expansion makes the game after around the renaissance era much more diverse and interesting. before, you pretty much could only advance your military and continue building up your progress to victory. if you werent doing a domination victory, the game could become monotonous (depending on your neighbors), but that has been fixed from what i hear with brave new world.",272.7
"you have to get this game as it is amazing and the mods give even more replay ability",291.0

"alot of fun never gets old when it comes to replaying it",284.6
"if you havnt become familiar with sid meiers civilization series you dont know what comr games are about. its deep, challenging and you can learn a little about our world. cod lovers need not apply.",282.9
"an epic game where you are a country, and you go through eras fighting and having peace with other countrys",17.6
"this game has ruined my social life ... i love it!!",31.2
"great game, i was a bit sceptical of the new layout with the different paragons from civ: iv, but i have since grown accustomed to the hexagons instead of plain squares. the game itself is awesome, with both the leader/civ traits and the special units, you have a lot of different road to head down with your civ. you can choose to go all out agressive if you have strong earlygame units or are a good diplomat with the citystates. there isnt two games that are alike. the map changes, the opposing ai does, and the attitude of nearby city states (whom you either please or ignore) makes the game feel like a new experience each game",136.9

"highly addictive and keeps me up until the sun comes out.",145.1
"one of the best games ive ever played. if you love strategy you wil get lost in this beatiful game. i would definetly reccommend this to anyone.",132.1
"8.7/10 im civ fan since civ 4. civilization v has a huge potential and its easy to get addicted to one more turn. in this game is always something to do, but play at big map after 100 turns can make gameplay slow :( ... so play in bigger maps req more fast cpu and better graphic card. civilization v is the revolution? rather not, but its one of best games of last years.",78.4
"buy it, its worth every cent, you will have endless hours of fun trying to conquer the world and being the best civilization ! :)",45.1
"civ 5 has surpassed the other versions of civ by a mile!",32.4
"super fun strategy game. ive played a lot of strategy games trying to find one that satisfies and i keep coming back to this one. the only dlc that i purchased was the brave new world and it has pretty much everything i needed.",11.1
"great game continually expanded with new packs that genuinely enhance or change the game play!",220.4
"amazing game. you can get lost in this game for hours and if fun for the whole time!!",346.3
"this is a fun strategy game that looks and acts like a board game would, as luck plays quite a part in this game from time to time. although it is horribly optimised, it does not talke alt-tabbing kindly, and after youre done playing this game and want to do something else, you should reboot your pc. dont get me wrong on this, though, this is still very fun to play, although the games take long, and you should limit multiplayer gaming to friends only, if you ask me, these games can easily take 8 hours or more. go get it if youre into strategy board-like games, its a great pickup at the price. brave new world also isnt a bad pickup, as it expands the game greatly.",143.3
"civilization is one of my favorite games. i have been a fan of the franchise since civ3. the games are long lasting and you rarely win in the same manner. the game is always challenging you, especially as you increment the level of difficulty. you will lose hour upon hour in this turn based game. there are dozens of civilizations and mods for this game. it has one of the best fan communities out there.",134.9
"i love this game! i have already played it 100 hours. if you want a casual strategy game or prefer a more indepth game, civ5 bring you all that. just pick that difficulity that fits your preferences.",286.5
"great game and very absorbing just be sure to buy the expansions as they greatly enhance the gameplay",124.7
"a veteran might prefer the earlier civs, but id say civ 5 is an awesome game. if youre new to civ games, i can definitely recommend this game. its even better with gods & kings and brave new world. if the singleplayer gets dull, the multiplayer is very much alive! one can also try mods!",121.8
"pure excellence in world domination sims. some things were better in civ iv but overall i prefere this one.",7.4
"this game is amazing. it is the first civ game ive played, and now that ive played it i love civ so much more. if youre thinking about buying this game, get it.",39.3
"even without the major dlc, this is a totally awesome game. lots of content, challenging gameplay, tons of civs to play,tons of units,tons of buldings, tons of wonders...yeah its pretty cool. the only major problem is the price, not only for the game but for the dlc, a bit overpriced. wait till a sale and then buy the heck out of it. then buy the dlc to make this game 200% more awesome.",349.2
"this is one of my favorite games in my library. it is great to play with friends or family, and the diplomacy can therfore be absolutley hilarious. i especially recommend using the earth map, because it makes it even more interesting when you can relate where you are in the game to where you live irl.",136.1
"whats to say that hasnt already been said? fantastic game and bane of all your future free time. i strongly recommend picking up the gold edition and the latest brave new world expansion pack to make the gameplay as complete as possible and address the issues that long-term civ fans had with the original release (religion, espionage, etc). with both expansion packs and all the add-on content, this is the best game in the series!",101.3
"the game is endlessly replayable and each game lasts such a long time. multiple days depending on the amount of civilizations. the expansions make even better with more early game fun as well as late game fun. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who is intrested. even the online is smooth, so i love to spend just one more turn with my friends",557.1
"literally the best strategy game ive ever played the best.",275.7
"much awesome so amazing such strategy very fun lots game wow",143.9
"i cannot recommend this game enough.if youre into strategy games this is a must by, and its easy for beginners to get into.",262.5
"very good game. it is fun to play for hours, though it seems much simpler than previous versions. so it can quickly turn repetitive. the cure for that i have found to be spending few hours playing civ 4 or civ 3.",121.7
"this game is so good, there should be an civ anonymous group",433.8
"this game is one of those gems you can go back to after years of not playing and ask yourself...why did i ever stop?? must buy.",194.0
"this is an amazing game. ruling the world couldnt be more fun. has the option to play a more casual quick game, or a more hardcore long game (can take days to finish). great game. hours and hours of possible gameplay, and there are almost always good deals on it. buy it!!",106.0
"the best of the series! really an amazing game and worthy of just one moreturn!",151.7
"you might check the time and wonder if the last 12 hours of your life was worth it, it was! civ v is an amazing turn based strategy game that will entertain you for hours. try not to be too competitive when playing with friends though, it can get ugly!",298.4
"awesome, immersive game that gives you lots of control over your empire. ive been a fan of the civilization series since civilization ii.",238.1
"the ultimate time travel device. simply begin playing this game, learn its subtle and addictive gameplay and as soon as you utter just one more turn it will immediately be between 6, 12 or even 24 hours since you began playing. simply put, many hours of fun to be had.",78.7
"sid meiers civilization is a series that has, deservedly, garnered many fans for its unique and enthralling strategic gameplay. all you ever want to do in civ v is press that end turn button one more time. brave new world makes everything so much better and adds a layer that was previously missing. but with civilization v, comes the knowledge that this world is one that we must share and with that come the responsibility of knowing that the decisions we make today will have a lasting impact on the generations of tomorrow.",114.1
"addictive, even if you are playing alone this game refuses to let you get bored.",93.7
"if youre looking for a strategy game thats not very deep or intensive, but still fun and addictive civ 5 is what you want. the game isnt as intense as some of its predecessors, but has grown into a fantastic game over the years and is definitely worth playing. i would also reccommend you get the brave new world dlc, as it adds a lot more interesting mechanics to the game that make it even more addicting.",659.0
"simple enough for a newbie, yet complex enough for it to take weeks to master. i prefer originals to the sequels usually, but i can make an exception in this case... obviously!",217.9
"really good game, i would recommend getting this. hours of fun and great multi-player",63.7
"love this game!!! tons of options. can play short or long games. multiple size and types of maps. can play slow or fast games.",1011.3
"although i dont have bnw, this game is easily one of my all time favourites. 10/10 will play again.",259.3
"this game is unique in so many levels. they make all the leaders act the same as if in real life and every difficulty has a diffrent strategy that only trial and error can solve. will you be warlike? or cultural? or even a gleaming beam of hope of technological wonders can your civilization hold as you conquer barbarian nations. can your empire stand the test of time?",295.4
"great game. but it feels like committing a crime to recommend this deadly addictive game to anyone. thus i will.",102.8
"the best strategy franchise for single players, i just wish the community was more active for multiplayer. if you like the idea of playing 10-40 hour single player campaigns where you stress over every detail, then this is the game for you.",88.7
"if the vast options for gameplay is not already enough to keep you coming back, the excellent and active modding community will keep you cemented to your chair.",1046.7
"if you are looking for a good strategy game this one is perfect, even if youre not pick it up or try it you wont regret it. sid meiers civilization v is game based on creating a civilization to rule them all, for example: fight other civilizations out the way or even win by a cultural victory. first time im giving a score but: 9.8/10",14.5
"holy  where do i begin? i wont begin anywhere im just going to say that this game is so awesome! i bought it 2 days ago and i already have 20+ hours on it. what am i doing with my life?",104.1
"this game revolutionizes turn based strategy. 2k did the impossible - they made one of the biggest games of its genre not only simpler and easier to approach, but increased the content and depth at the same time. this game is far beyond some of the similar titles (not exactly similar, but some of the more famous). it has more depth and more options than simcity, its longer and has more content (and still more options) than spores civilization stage (not even worth comparing to, but its still famous). its only real modern rival, starcraft 2, is too complex to jump into, and is difficult to understand. this game knows exactly what it is and what youre supposed to do - advance humanity to perfection. this is the game that blew age of empires out of the water, people. theyre gone. go for it.",96.8
"amazing game....one of the best strategy games ever played. very addicting and even better when you have a friend(or 2) to play with....10/10",57.8
"while different from most other games in the series, theyve certainly not failed to amaze me.",71.5
"amazing game, if you love to plan and build up armys, this is your game",1081.0
"i cant stop playing. send help. also, never trust the ai. ever.",458.0
"one of the best games i have ever played if you like long-term strategy games.",435.5
"if you are going to get this game than you should try and get the expansion packs asap so you get the whole expirence. the base game is very bare, but with the expansions it becomes a much richer and fleshed out expirence. i recomend getting the gold edition when it goes on sale so you can get the proper expirence with civ v.",67.3
"this game is addictive. it uses the same tried and true formula of the other games and will keep you glued to the screen for hours as you just need one more turn... the game is more balanced than ever if you get the 2 additional dlcs. the first makes religion worthwhile and the 2nd adds more lategame options and a revamp of the cultural victory conditions.",119.2
"easy way to waste lots of time. imo, best played with friends vs. ai.",636.1
"guaranteed to occupy your time if your incredibly bored. ive already spent quite a bit on this game and plan to spend even more time on it, its practically endless.",311.0
"never play this game before an exam. one more turn will end up being 3 hours later.",302.4
"so i started playing one day and then was never seen again.",85.1
"who could ask for more than really time consuming games? i know i couldnt",148.7
"super fun time consuming game if you like ruling and creating an empire! especially with friends :d",96.5
"one of the best games ive ever played. unlimited hours of gameplay.",77.0
"very slow starting game, but thats what makes it great. chosing what your civ researchers first can help or hurt in the long run. its a new game everygame and games do take a long time to complete depending on the settings you chose. very fun does have mods for it. 8/10",57.3
"if your new to civ, 9.5/10, if your not it starts out being 7.5/10 then as you adapt 9.5/10. hard to adapt from civ 3 being the expansion mechanics are very different, but overall very good.",99.0
"a lot of fun, not too steep of a learning curve and the multiplayer is great. can be a bit laggy at times, but not usually anything that is not worth dealing with.",422.7
"civ 5 is the high watermark thus far in the series. at this point in time, the game has been patched to be more than balanced and versatile. i hope in future iterations of this game that the music will be evermore expanded to include not only cultural influence, but developmental and incidental playlists.",91.9
"the origional game, gods and kings, and brave new world are $15 through the humble bundle for 10 more days, so get it.",334.8
"im not sure why civ v gets such a horrendous rep from the civ community. it took all the unncecesary elements from past civ games (like religion and stacked combat units for example) and either streamlined them or got rid of them altogether. that makes the game less of a slog as far as im concerned. civ v is still part of the civilization series no matter how much people want to complain about it, and it still plays like a civ game. in other words, civilization is still the watermark for turn-based strategy games, and no amount of tweaking or nerfing is going to change that.",142.9
"this game is probably by far one of the best stratagy game i have played. playing multiplayer is wonderful especially if you have some friends to play it with and it allows you to meet new people that obviousely like the same game as you. i would recomend this game to any person that loves a good strategy game. hence why im trying to convert as many people as i can to this game. have fun!!!!!",240.0
"the only game where invading a virtual version of mecca would get malaysian religious officials panties in a bunch. 5/5 stars from me. play it my friends and people who read this.",29.1
"terrible, its like total war but campaign map only. no battlemechanics what so ever, even if its not a wargame it should not play like a ipad game. the tech tree is dull too. overall - really  dont buy it, totalwar rome i is much better.",70.3
"civ 5 is one of those games that is so difficult to understand, so you spend hours and hours playing and learning the game, never able to fully perfect it. it is an amazing game to pick up and play, expecially on sale.",138.9
"it is good. wish there was a faster game time though otherwise with friends it is a long effort.",143.0
"want to waste hundreds of hours of your life? buy it. incredibly addicting and the expansions are well worth the investment.",198.9
"brilliant fun by your own or with a friend but be sure you have freinds to play with for some friendly banter",60.4
"on sale, get it now! great turn-based stategy game. starts off slow, but as the game progresses it really makes your heart beat and your palms sweat. the multiplayer is surprisingly balanced and a great time with friends. a must buy.",239.6
"i loved civ 4 but the improvements to this one make it even better, i would recommend this to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.",51.1
"this is a great game :d addictive... played for five hours and didnt even notice that :)",147.0
"for someone who really loves strategy games its a must have. use your brain, use it a lot - to make your empire grow and grow, let the people stay happy, make money, expand and take over the world of civ5!",91.8
"for a four year old game, civ5 presents a fantastic experience on par with modern strategy games. with particular emphasis on individual turns, each game steadily develops into a robust (albeit historically inaccurate) simulation of competitive civilizations. though the learning curve might be somewhat steep, the in-game tips are helpful and generally non-intrusive. once you get the hang of the mechanics, youll be hooked. keep in mind that each game spans the history of the world and then some. so grab some friends and get comfy; this might take a while. absolutely recommend!",59.8
"an excellent new version of the game. the new rule of only one military unit per tile seems strange at first, but ultimately makes for more strategic gameplay. this is definitely one of those games that will have you thinking ok, only one more turn and then finding yourself still playing hours later. strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys the civilization series or strategy empire games. 9.5/10",129.2
"in sid meiers civilization v, you can choose a ancient civilization and build their empire the way you want. each civilization has its own upsides and downsides. you get to choose a map type, game pace, and difficulty. you can also choose how many ai you want to play with/against you. there is multiplayer, so you can play with some friends, or some randoms. i also highly recommend buying all of the dlc when you get the chance. it just adds more to the already amazing game. oh mighty player, can you sit on your  all day and play this game? can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? 10/10",63.8
"this game has been my life for more than 9 years. and so it continues...",288.7
"adictive game. if you like games like: command & conquer you proberbly like this one to if not better. i reccomand to get at least 1 of the dlc like: (gods & kings :))",56.1
"amazing game! ive been playing games of the civilization series since civilization 2 on pc and snes, and this has all the magic of its predecessors. very smooth gameplay and interface with regular updates via expansions and dlc. this game brought me to steam.",803.9
"this game is as addictive as reddit, tvtropes, and wikipedia all rolled into one. 11/10 best game ever",69.5
"the dull technology is anti-historical .every nation has similar tech .you are mongols of steppes -no problem . you can still build lighthouse of alexandria or collosus of rhodes -both monuments strictly made by very prosperous sea-faring nations. it is ridiculous . further more you can not set era when you want to halt the advancement. i dont feel playing modern era ,but i can not do nothing about it . even more the scenarios are awful . some of them as short as only 70 turns long. they simple threw some uncooked pseudo historic technology into the pot because it would take few dollars !!! to give every nation the tech it really could have access before the modern era. there are lot of people whoo does not care about anything for them this game is perfect . if you feel like doubtful about central american civilisations having cavalry or other nonsense then this game is not for you.",9.7
"one of the best strategy games. you can play it for hours and you still are excited. :)",10.5
"fun strategy game. would reccomend to any fan of the series or to any turn based strategy in general.",332.8
"they did it again, i strongly believe that the civilization series is one of the greatest works to teach about human history, achievements, our soul, our sins, our philosophy, our politics, our chances and decisions. it should be put on a working machine and send into space to show aliens that we are horrible, but at least we know how to heave fun. and where there is civilization, there is hope.",46.1
"fun game that steals your life and the respect of all people around you.",61.3
"a great exploration strategy game. similar to age of empires. must buy!",14.4
"easily one of the best games i have ever played. its just so good.",165.1
"a little slower than i was expecting, but the interactions are great and there are a lot of new features.",128.5
"your girlfriends younger, stupider sister. in the right light though... damn!",744.5
"if youve ever wanted to rule the world . . . .this game is for you. if youve ever wondered what developing a god complex is like, yeeeup. are you the type of person that would, if handed the reigns of civilization, put its full focus toward the development of fusion powered robots; just to satisfy a grudge from when denmark laid siege to your city and then denounced you in front of that cute celtic warrior gal? if so, i think you know what you must do. kiss your family and friends goodbye, forget about your dreams, plans, and aspirations; and play one more turn.",135.0
"incredibly fun game. much like the civ 4 although far prettier and now with a redesigned combat system which i find very enthralling. terribly addicting and incredibly well designed. a must buy for a fan of the series.",75.2
"great game, it looks like a real life ruiner and i couldnt be happier",15.0
"if rtss arent your thing, this game does the job, no zerg rushing, just ghandi and his mission to destroy your life and civilization. so remember to rip out and eat his heart to gain his courage, his tasty courage....",353.4
"excellent but very addicting game turning minutes into hours of competitive strategies of awesomeness!",9.9

"amazing amount of rich and diverse civilizations to choose from, beautiful animations and scenery, fantastic to play with friends",726.1
"if youre a fan of turn based strategy games, 4x or just loved civ 4, this is well worth the money! now that it has seen some patchy love, it has only gotten better.",57.7
"this game is pretty much addiction defined. it is the single best example ive ever played of the just one more level... syndrome. a long running strategy title where you create an empire and attempt to take over the world via military, science, or the arts, it is simple to learn and takes ages to master completely. can be considered to be age of empires older, more refined cousin.",112.0
"i absoulutely adore this game now. i played the civilization revolution while i had a 360 but damn this one is amazing. so mad that i didnt play this on computer before. i honestly cant wait for another one so that way i can get it when its fresh on peoples radars.",141.6
"really nice strategy game where you have to think hard about your turns. i like the different ways of winning and the task to pay attention to all your opponents tactics and winning possibilities.",65.5
"very good successor to the civilization series. although severly broken upon release, later patches have increased the playability.",1090.4

"this is one of my favorite games of all time. when you first start playing it, you are hooked for hours upon hours, and it may start to get boring. then you leave it for a few months, but then as soon as you say hm, i havent played civ in a while you play it and are instantly hooked again for several hours, and the process repeats",46.5
"if you liked civ4 this has some good changes. there are some things that are broken, like stacking military units but it does not effect game play too bad. i recommend this game if you are looking for a change from civ4.",122.3
"better then ever with the gods and kings expansion.",158.3
"i dont have much to add to the conversation that other people have not said already; if you like previous civ games, then youll probably love this one, too. there are some interesting gameplay changes, for better or worse, such as changes in naval games. in previous games, i always found building ships then loading those ships to be tedious, but this rendition makes that much less tedious by not needing cargo ships.",10.4
"this game is an epic time devouring modern board game. the orginal civilization gameplay with the new features added by civ 5+ expansion packs gives all new experiences to the old skool world domination urge and lets you develop your empire in new and unique ways.",416.4
"really good and fun game! only got a few hours in but ill definitely play more.",4.8
"my machine is well exceeds the specs that this game requires. i have never gotten it to run. i think that says it all.",18.3
"best game ever! need i say more? buy it & play it!",295.0
"civilization v is a great strategy game. if you are a person who likes history, this is a great game to get. you are able to create your own civilization! how cool is that?!??!?! you can control your armies, build cities, and take over the planet! this game is so fun, even though im new to the civ series. this was my first civ game, and it is excellent for starters and previous civ players. i would absolutely, positively, recommend this game to all of my friends and family.",88.5
"overy adicting at first, will destroy(or improve) your weekends. after you beat it though, it stops being adicting and becomes repetative.",69.6
"this is by far one of the best strategy games out there. i believe it is a huge improvement over civ 4. the dlc has touched most of what people had wrong with the game, however the best parts are some of those improvements over civ 4, such as no unit stacking.",83.0
"always invites you to play just one more turn.. and another..",75.3
"its streamlined but that doesnt mean its bad. troop management on the field is more important now with the stacking roops being gone and cities being able to defend themselves.",59.4
"turn based strategy good graphics smooth gameplay. good if you have time to kill....",134.4
"this game was the first game i ever got on steam and it is still the game i play the most. even without all of the dlc, this game will ruin your nights if you play it before you go to bed. i strongly reccommend getting the brave new world dlc because it gives you features that make hundreds of more replays possible. 10/10.",109.3
"great social strategy game. the engine creates a pretty easy-going sort of playstyle. artwork is decent, and so is variety. the diplomacy in the game does not have much depth to it, and creating a lasting alliance with another faction is a rarity. there is also the problem with turn processing, at later turns (150+), you may aswell tab out of the game, as you might be waiting over 5 minutes for the game to end the turn and start a new one. still very enjoyable, 8/10.",123.2
"a turn-based strategy game that focuses on all of the aspects of building and maintaining an empire.",170.3
"wickedly addicting. there is more content than you can imagine, and with a new expansion just around the corner expect to waste away hours and hours.",60.3
"really fun tbs game. fan of all the civs and this one is great! i have the gold edition with the gods & kings pack. gives tons of playable characters!",68.7
"this is one jewel of a game. this has to be the greatest kingdom managing sim out there, if you get the expansion packs then it is the best. i wish it had most of the expansion pack fetures at start, and that kinda feels like a money grab. but the money is worth it.",30.0
"endless hours of game play... one... more... turn... :}",536.9
"can be very time consuming if you want it to be, otherwise so much fun! :d",499.9
"civ 5 has gotten to the point where it can now be crowned as king of tbs. be very careful with this game, ive sat in the same place playing it for hours...",185.2
"its a good game,a little slow when starting a game, but speeds up as you go along.",188.3
"play this game if you like lengthy and in depth strategy style game play. although the game has various speed settings, often times the longer the setting the easier the gameplay becomes when versed with aggressive computer ai.",154.3
"civilization isnt a game so much as it is a hobby, but if you are into turn-based strategy, civ v is some of the best. ive been playing this series for years and i am still learning things about improving my game. ...just dont buy this one if you like sleeping. civilization and sleeping are not compatible.",460.2
"a game that makes time flow by as if it were water. amazing game, it definately makes you think with every game different from the last.",182.5
"this game should have a surgeon generals warning on it. i mean, look at my play time ffs...",220.6
"i recommend the crap out of this game. buying this game is like giving away your soul. great fun. 10/10",22.7
"this is one of the most addicting games you can find. fo-shizzle",16.6
"i played the other ones, loved them so i got civ 5 and loved it. i would recommed this to anyone",227.5
"this is a great game! was recommended to me by a friend and is now one of my most played games on steam! it has infinate replayability and every game is different. one of the best strategy games ever.",81.2
"one of the most addicting games. time flys by when playing! (literally)",275.2
"having started my civ career at a young age i felt that the game was overly complex and hard to grasp the city management and such. years later i pick up the fifth iteration, and with such happiness, understand now why this game has the lineage that it does. only recently have i invested serious time and i am dumbfounded as to why i havent sooner. grab a couple of friends and start playing. my only issue with this game is that there is no real world clock to make you aware of how many hours youve been sitting and enjoying your time. grab this, the expansions, and go lose yourself.",14.2
"this game will suck your free time away. it is well worth it.",971.3
"one of the only games i cant stop playing! addicting and frustrating! one of the most strategic games you will ever play and one you will either feel accomplished or regretful by the end. a great buy 9/10.",321.3
"this is an amazing strategy game that you will spend hours playing and its even better with a freind it is a game worth getting.",198.5

"very good game, a big improvement over the first game in my opinion.",14.7
"accidentally nuked my own capital when trying to move the nuke there. s good.",194.1
"this is the greatest turn based strategy franchise of all time. civilization 5 will suck your life away as, let me just do one more thing, becomes a day of gaming. the unit balance of this game is extraordinary, and the random world creation keeps the map/environment fresh and new every game. there is a large number of leaders to pick from each with their own abilities and special units/buildings that can allow for different strategic options even given similar set ups or in game technology/policy under a different leader. raging barbarians ftw!!!",453.6
"this game is very fun, but only if you like stratagy games. i would recommned this game to all of friends if they werent all playing it. i sound like a commercial for this game because i am,now give sid meier all your moneies so that he may continue to create masterpieces like this so buy now.",53.0
"i have played all of sid meiers games and have enjoyed them all. they are somewhat relaxing and i feel take slightly more brain power to play then your average game. the only aspect that i dont like is the multiplayer side. i think it needs overhauled and they should come at it from a different angle.",135.6
"i have to recommend this game because it is a really fun strategy game where you pick a civilization and win by science,culture, or world domination and every civilization has its own skills and downfalls, but i always will be in love with the french because it is in my culture!",92.7
"civ 5 is a really fun turn based strategy game. great to play with friends.",21.1
"an awesome strategy game. it is turn based but the good thing is that everyone takes their turns simultaneously so it doesnt take additional time. the game can still take awhile but i love how the put economy into the game so it isnt just about building a big army but can also be about building wonders, building cities, and a variety of other ways to get the most points and ultimately win the game!",24.4
"sid meiers civilization v is probably my most beloved game, and deserves all the praise it is getting. when playing the turn-based strategy game i found that i could play for hours on end, letting my civilization grow and my army conquer. i loved playing the single player of civ v, however i found that i enjoyed the multiplayer muc more. online multiplayer with my friends was probably the most enjoyable part of this game for me, we ran around, conquered empires and razed hell... however the multiplayer with strangers is a different story. you will find that these people either kick you, never join, attack to quickly or just leave, and even when you do find a game they are probably playing on a dlc you dont have. overall however, its awesome! rating = 9.5/10 great!",157.8
"i love this game!!! although as it goes onto the loading screen it crashes... it didnt do this before but it may be because i have windows 8 but i hope the creators can fix this...",10.5
"one of the best stategy games i have ever played :d",98.3
"one of the best if not the best turn based strategy game around. you never get bored of it.",118.3
"great game. all a civ game should be. great graphics, lots of civilizations to play, lots of different paths to go. if something could be better, it would be the ai and the difficult level. the ai of the normal dificult level isnt very smart, and in the next level it is too strong, not because it became smarter, but because the game gives it too much advantage. all in all, it is a great game, a should play one.",153.9
"a great game, great strategy. if you desire to be the ruler of the world via conquest or diplomacy. wish to form a more cultured world or to simply leave your enemies on earth while you travel to a distant star. this is the game to play.",242.2
"really addictive and deep, one of the best strategy games out there today. recommend buying on sale with all dlc packs.",219.0
"its a really good game most people dont like it because they only play the 1st 100bc years so really they dont play but its a really good game so i hope you comment this and buy the game :d",176.4
"best game ever , i usually hate strategys of any kind but this series sucks you in and doesnt let you go . some games could be 15 hours and some could be an hour but no matter what youll restart agin and keep going to you win . -luke 10/10",25.1
"i love this game. except when my friend nukes me after an epic game when im about to win. if this were a review for my friends, itd say not recommended. but its for the game, and for that i easily say thumbs up.",248.5
"absolutely addictive. easy to pick up and play even if you arent that into strategy games, its probably the best strategy game ive ever played. easily 9/10 for the base game, with the expansions its easily 10/10.",15.5
"the pinnacle in round based empire building. spent far too many hours on this one :p",43.4
"before you start up a game make sure to cancel all the crap you were going to do this weekend",81.8
"simply amazing. i dont usually play strategy games but i made an exception for this one. civ 5 is a great, immersive, realisitic game that forces you to make tough choices to help your civilization survive.",50.4
"this is probably one of my favorite games. in my youth, i played axis & allies the board game. when i got older, i played the pc versions of a&a. civilization v, while different, brings back that nostalgia. i enjoy playing civilization v for hours on end.",287.8
"sid meiers civilization v is an amazing game that offers hours upon hours of replay value. lately, i have been playing more of the scenarios, each offering multiple different ways to play (my personal favorite at the moment is the rush for africa scenario). an amazing game with great value. 9/10",477.2
"the only time youre ever going to see germany ask greece for money to stay afloat.",72.1
"its civ 5. + many civilization + many strategy to employ + highly replayable. + one of the best current 4x games out there now. - suck away your ram like a mofo. you need a very high end system to ever think about playing at the huge map awesome. - suck away your life due to the addiction level. - ai can be very idiotic - not the best diplomatic options available compared to previous generation civ4 etc and smac.",272.4
"another improvement on the classic civilaztion series. this version is better looking and more playable that the last few. the changes deemphasize massive stacking of armies making the conquest game much more strategic. im even looking forward to trying out a cultural victory.",53.2
"have been a fan of the civ franchise since civ 3 came out and i was in highschool. i love these games. this is the most fun i have had on a civ game since civ revolution on consoles. the learning curve is not that steep and if you are like me the montra of just one more turn will be your cake. very fun game.",56.7
"one of the best turn strategy games i have played so far. the numerous victory systems will constantly keep you on your feet - rushing towards your victory of choice whilst keeping an eye or even impeding enemies from doing the same. the expansions have brought in fantastic systems for faith/religion and new mechanics for culture. the additional civilisations also bolster your choices and help you refine your playstyle. the sheer number of buildings and monuments you can build also give you a chance to specialise in different areas of the game. wonders are a particularly exciting system, buildings which take many turns to complete but then give excellent bonuses. the historical background found within the game has also amazed me, gameplay and depth top notch. player, will your civilisation pass the test of time? mine sure did, and it shall for many years to come!",153.5
"just by looking at my play time of this game, youd think i would be biased. youre likely correct, however the satisfaction you recieve from pilaging pocatello, racing rameses ii, exterminating elizabeth and angering attila are but a few of the unique moments found in civ. i highly recommend any new faces to civ v to grab the gold edition, as it fills gaps that are otherwise very dry gameplay wise, whereas brave new world ups the complexity even further then what it initally is. one final warning, dont let gandhi get nuclear weapons. he will use them with no predjudice.",340.8
"you cant get michael rosen as a great artist in this game, what sorcery is this. i doubt hell be a great writer in bnw either. besides this flaw, this is quite a great game. in fact this game is worth more than your plums, and it steals your time faster than an electronic rabbit. dont believe me? buy it and own zuma and friends, preferably with bnw and g&k because venice sounds so awesome. this game gets a stable 9.71(23)/10 from me. #omniktheknighthogapprovesofthisgreatgameyoloswaggabenisgod",797.1
"one of the best games i ever played, the dlc is way overpriced, but the main game is already pretty good by itself, you can spend lots of time just trying to get the fun achievements.",92.8
"this game captures the tediousness of politics and the thrill and pressure of war. i would reccomend this game to anyone clever and tactful enough to succeed in it.",10.3
"this game is supa awesome and i have spen tway too much time playing it... so its good :3",332.0
"not as good as civ 4 but still great in its on right",39.0
"this game is really fun, though i havent played very much. but for all those out there this game takes a really long time to play so i would suggest you make some time to play this game. i got this game about 4 days ago and ive already spent about 30 hours playing this game but all those hours were well spent creating the perfect civilizations.",35.7
"one of the most addictive games ive played, loads of fun easy to get lost in hours of fun.",13.7
"this is hands down the best game i have ever played. tons of replayability with all the different civilizations available in just the base game, but gods and kings and brave new world are a must just for the addition of tourism, religion and espionage.",318.6
"very fun and tedious game. meth heads, and people with no concept of time will love this game. for all others its a great game, but if your going to play a large game dont make any plans for that day.",74.7
"one of the best games ever, and its better than ever...",213.6
"gamers should marry gamers. and if that happens, playing hot seat civilization v with the wife counts a spending quality time together :)",846.1
"epic - if youre not that in to fps games and such and like a good thinker and strategy with a civilization thats constant developing their tech to kill an enemy or get loved by the ppl then i recommend that you buy this game now while its on sale on steam!!!",95.8
"with the brave new world expansion this becomes literally the best point in the series. no stacks of doom, trading, religion, tourism...only thing missing is that espionage could be a bit more fleshed out, with spy units that could poison water and sabotage and whatnot.",123.4
"ter r lats of octagones nd  but ovral its a pretii gud game",46.1
"best game of the series yet! make sure to get the main expansions, makes it a lot better",107.4

"nothing like having the aztecs sink your roman aircraft carrier with a nuclear submarine in the year 2100.",277.2
"this game is a lot of fun. just dont get into war with the strongest civilization in the game! already made that mistake. twice.",37.7
"seriously. if you dont know about civ. buy it and enjoy enjoying this for the first time. i envy you. if you do already know about civ, then you probably already own this.",33.1
"this is one of those games where you intend just to play a couple of hours and suddenly its the next day. highly addictive and fun everytime you jump in, especially with friends.",111.1
"you like strategy? you have a hankering to take over the world and subjugate its inhabitants under your rule? you want to spend the next 5-6 hours of your life doing just that? then this game is for you. if you are a busy person i would not recommend this because it will suck your life away. but hey, if you have some time to spare then i would higly recommend this game. 10/10 would play again.",278.8
"the late-game portion of civilization games has always been a weak point in the series. often, during the middle ages, it becomes obvious which player will win the game. as well, managing a large empire with many cities can become overwhelming. luckily they addressed this problem in civilzation 5 by making the late-game run so slowly, its essentially unplayable!",227.2
"i have only played one game of civ5 since i got the game. marathon is  to real time calendars. i have the expansions for this, but havent utilized them yet. one more turn...",126.3
"this game sucks hours out of your life. 10/10 would buy again",427.5
"i have been in love with civ since i played the timeless civ ii. whilst civ v will never capture the simplicity of civ ii it is certainly worth the investment especially if on sale. the add ons do add a lot so it is worth checking those out too.",8.3
"excellent game, first game of mine from civilization series and i have really enjoyed my time playing this game.",339.6
"this is my favourite game at the moment, and has been for quite some time!",20.6
"for strategy! this is a really plus game! form the league of superfriends with your favourite civilizations! declare war on poland! outpopulate india and china! form nato with russia! get backstabbed by france and greece! france:  y u haff to be mad, it only game . yeah france, well screw you. ( no seriously get this game its good )",572.6

"if you need my review to decide whether to play this game, you probably dont want to play this game.",933.5
"this is by far my most favorite strategy game! there are many other games that are pretty close to this such as total war rome, and so forth but where this game realy shines is the chronology. the fact that i can start with pretty much any civilization during the ancient period and take them into the future is amazing! not only that but each and every civilization has their own advantages such as japan of course having superior airforce, with rome having faster growth, etc. but none of them too overpowering. in the end there are so many aspects to this game that i truly love and would reccomened this game to anyone even if this is your first time trying out strategic games.",65.7
"is a great game for new/casual strategy game players, and is also a great game for hardcore serious strategy players, there is always things to do in your empire, but it never overwhelms you. so yeah, its good =)",121.6
"really just the most addictive strategy game i own. really great to play with friends.",78.1
"get some friends round, start a game and play for the next 9 hours. the most time-sucking game ever.",71.7

"ive lost hours of my life to this game. thanks sid!",594.8
"sid meiers team create the best civilisation to date. we all remember the thrill of civilisation 1, where you would stack militia after militia into your cities to create a unbeatable force.... well now civ is more complex and creative with its strategies, trades and politics. hours have been well spent dominating the world with science, culture, and where neccesary a little tough love.",137.1
"complex strategy play to keep things interesting with some new (to me) options to enhance gameplay like espionage. overall a great game, easy to get lost for hours at a time.",110.9
"so much fun, multi-player is pretty good and they are releasing extras to make it better.",736.0
"this is one of the most addictive games in my library/steam and thats just for single player, with your friends it gets even better! buy now!",206.2
"first civ game ive ever played, an my god do i understand what the big deal is about. i think i got this 4 days ago and have probably clocked up 30+ hours! if its on sale get it! if its not then just pay more and still get it.",35.5
"a great turn-based strategy game with a huge replayability value. while most of the victory conditions are not perfect, the combat is excellent and makes going to war an interesting and fun experience where strategy is more important than force.",553.7
"i thought i knew how to play this game, but then i realized recently ive never even thrown a nuke at someone in game. i have so much more to learn. ill keep playing until i can win the space race by turn 3.",126.9
"want to be a leader of a nation. this is as close as it will get.",419.3
"the game is great if it does not crash you system everytime you play. i am playing on a razer edge pro with touch screen. if you look at the adds for this rig the screen shows this game. soooo disapointed. these guys should not get another penny till they work out the bugs. just uninstalled :( cant take it anymore. will never buy a k2 game again",15.4
"civ v is truly a fantastic game. if you are into strategy and fun gameplay you will love this game. it never gets boring because there are endless amounts of things you can do! definitely a great buy, but if you are getting it make sure you get gold edition!",134.0
"this is an amazing strategy game. you can easily lose yourself in its in-depth gameplay!",183.7
"i cant stand this game. i have no idea how to play it. it is hard. do not recommend because it confuses me alot.",11.8
"great game alot of fun. if you like any of the others youll probably enjoy this too.",213.5
"one of my favorite games. its casual and medium-paced, perfect for doing something else, or just chatting with whomever you are playing with. (during single player, its actually quite quick). i disliked it a lot at first, and there is a learning curve. just sit through the tutorial and mess around a bit, it grows on you. works great on most pcs, and you dont even need a mouse to play since it is turn-based. i highly recommend it!",267.2
"civ 5 speaks 4 languages: english, profanity, sarcasm, & real .",142.2
"civ 5 is one of the most addictive games on the market. its replayability is near infinate, and that is only increased by the ease of playing online with other steam members (way easier that the past attempts at multiplayer).",135.8
"great game. if you want to forget what time it is and pretend you can travel time, set it to marathon and try to remember how long youve been playing.",64.5
"i have mixed feelings baout his game. i like civ4 better but i like the hexacon map and clouds on civ5. also the multiplayer on civ4 is wayyyy better. if youre new to civ5 and/or want to play send a request.",334.0
"picked this up during the holiday sales because ive never played a civ game. im really glad i did. its deep, well made, and highly addicting. the game modes are different enough to keep me very busy for a long time. my only complaint is the price of the expansions. i got civ 5 for 9.99 and it comes with a single scenario (rise of the mongols) - for other expansion packs id have to pay 29.99 (brave new world, gods + kings) each. i cant justify paying 3x for the expansions, which is too bad, since id really like to explore additional scenarios and especially the religion mechanic. that aside, i dont need the expansions, and civ 5 was a truly great find for me. absolutely recommend the game and hope that the expansions or gold version come down in price before too long.",181.1
"nice game, you gotta put down a lot of time to be pro, end game for pro player isnt that fun :(",368.0
"amazing game. very strategic until you get nukes. then its just a mad race to wipe ghandis  off the earth.",15.7
"i was nuked by ghandi and i have never laughed more in my life",216.3

"for those who played civ2 for the whole life and now trying civ5 - dont build the same amount of roads/mines and farmlands. now they cost. a lot.",41.1
"what can i say about civ 5? it is the greatest strategy game ever made thus far, and i doubt that will change until civ 6. sid meir is single handedly dragging the stratagy genre through a time when strategy games are about as popular g.w bush. there is no reason to have steam and not own this game. it is the greatest concept ever conseived by a games designer. now put down your tools workers and worship at the feet of or lord, sid meir. 10/10",46.9
"this game is very interesting. i have only won 2-3 games so far in 80+ hours of game play. i keep coming back to the game and doing more with it. i suggest this game for everyone!!.",108.7
"this game is absolutly fantastic. you can lose hours just getting halfway through a single game. no matter how you want to play through a game, whether you want to attack other countries, make peace, build sceince (my personal favorite as everything is easier if you have better sceince then other people), build culture, spread a religion, build cities, etc. and all thoose and more are ways you can win a game too! the ai could be a bit better but i hear the brave new world expansion fixes that (i want it sooooooo badly). so to sum all that up: play this game",26.7
"probably the most addictive game i have ever played. you keep thinking that next turn will be your last, but no! you just cant stop. very fun that your leader can live from 2000 b.c until the future which is about 4000-5000 years. also funny is that you can choose different religions to your city. for example- christianity in arabia and so on. 9/10 - cons: slow multiplayer players pros: probably everything",101.1

"lost hours of my life to this game in a matter of 2 weeks.",300.4
"this game is probably the best strategy game i have played in quite some time. best advice is to not let time get the best of you cause it will slip away quickly. civilization v requires lots of patience and to think on every early and late game move you make . i strongly recommend this if you are veteran strategist or new to the genre.",146.4
"i used to make fun of people who played this game. but- i was wrong. it is pretty much the best game ever.",138.4
"specific historical accuracy aside, civ gives you a quick look at all of human history. a very addicting game, dont be suprised when you look at the clock and realize that a couple of hours have passed.",90.6
"great game, incredible improvement from previous versions.",77.7
"great game overall. takes some time to get to know how to do everything, but it is worth it. once you have learned you will be hooked.",94.7
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i know. you can play it over and over again, and its fun every time. i strongly recommend this game and all of its dlc to anyone who wants a good challenge and also, if anyone has the chance, burn that traitorous  ghandi for me.",70.0

"this game has the best replay value of any game ive ever played.",830.0
"what cant i recommend? this game will eat up your hours, turning day to night. its indepth game play and full on strategy can take you away leaving you wide eyed thinking what the hell happened to you life. note: i am only mentioning this if you really are into strategy and mostly games similar to civ v. the addition of ranged bombardment i think is awesome, it just allows players to fire weapons from behind the front lines, you also have fully animated leaders interacting with players from a screen-filling diplomatic scene which i guess is not too bad, kinda just adds a bit of spice to it. if you have friends, group or a party to play with then this is definitely a bonus.",146.0
"best game ive played in 10 years! extremely addictive. beware, you will have no life after you play this!!",169.0
"this is a great game that i would recommend to evryone and anyone who likes anything to do with strategy, war and utter domination. i guess thats most people. well done firaxis, this game truly deserves all of the recognition it has received. it is an absolute masterpiece if you dont mind losing a bit of historical accuracy and is great for casual and hardcore gamers that dont mind sitting at their pc for 10 hours straight. hats off to firaxis once again.",72.5

"always come back to this, game just satisfies on all levels",1068.1
"time ceases to exist while you try and manage it in game. so many options. so many things to forget to do. strangly compelling for how not fancy the game looks. could use some work on the deplomacy system. being attacked with no warning for no reason and not even being able to attempt to negotiate.....seems like some reality was left out. great game all together and tons of badges to earn. already bought it for a friend for xmas.",31.3
"game is fantastic. play as multiple civilizations and progress from the ancient era to the future era. 5/5",186.0
"a very simplistic sequel to the civilization series, but thats not a bad thing. the game is gorgeous and although a lot of the micromanagement between your cities has been removed, combat is a much more enjoyable experience with a hex-based grid and the inability to stack units. ive yet to play brave new world, but gods and kings is a very worthwhile addition to the game, as well.",158.7

"played with one with me mum before she died from and we ate her. still a good play, neh?",127.6
"fantastic game. the game has options so that you may choose the speed at which you progress, build, and evolve as a civilization. can run on normal settings with a terrible computer. can get a little repetitive after hours and hours of play but what game doesnt?",112.9

"i always have been more of a rts guy and never played any of the civilization games. but due to a giveaway and the holiday steam sales, i got the base game, both expansions, and all the other dlc. i had always heard how this series was addicting and time consuming. wow, they were right, as of writing this i have spent 24 hours in about 3 days of playing. i am happy i got to jump in after the expansions, since i enjoy more of the non-combat ways of winning. even though, i just got the game and expansion, i am looking forward to see what else they release, ether another expansion or civ 6.",76.7
"best online strategy game. i love how you can set up an empire, and go from there, anything can happen. it only becomes more challenging as you advanced through out the various dificulties. you could win or lose in a heart beat. alot harder than the originals.",191.7

"do you hate your life? do you find yourself lacking in any specific meaningful way? then allow sid meiers civilization v to fill that gap! command armies, build cities and strategically master some of the greatest figures in recorded history such as: ghandi and some other folks that nobody talks as much about anymore on the internet so why name them. play with your friends! assuming you have them, theyll thank you for conning them into buying this soul-sucking lifestealer of a time consumer. sid meier games: replacing your loved ones since 1985.",101.9
"ive played the franchise since the original civilization. civ v is a great next generation for the franchise. it brings a fresh approach to the game which some people dont like, but for sheer enjoyment, it is easily as good as any of its predecessors.",736.5
"sid meiers civilization v is arguably one of the best strategy based games of this decade.",182.3
"+great strategies simulation, especially at higher difficuly levels. -some leaders are slightly overpowered and others are just useless. +hours of fun +nice animations -overpowering the rest of the ai gives a lot of disadvantages",70.2
"civilization v is an amazing game with great grahpics and it was worth every cent",333.2
"civilization has grown a lot since its humble beginnings with version 1 of the game. one that i played for years. with all the new graphics, the diplomacy, intrigue, and all the fun new techs and buildings to explore, civilization 5 (especially with the gods and kings add-on) is the pinnacle of the series. this game will have you saying just.. one... more... turn....",49.8

"another great sid meier game. woweeeeeeee fun stuf!",145.3
"9/10 only played it for a few hours, and with my pc, it was mainly loading screen hours. but for the time i did play it, it was a great game. fantastic turn based strategy, great graphics, easy to learn controls, and grand follow up dlc that just gives variety, not an overpowering force. my favorite part is the research tree, a system i feel many strategies have only started to do, and have done so poorly.",18.5
"very time consuming, but in one of the greatest ways possible. imagine risk with over 9000 features added.",635.1

"im new to the civ franchise, and found civilization v to be great fun! just one more turn runs through my head for hours as it is sometimes very difficult to put down. i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys turned based games, or wants a nice upgrade to risk. :)",27.7
"strategy games are sometimes hit and miss with me, but i thoroughly enjoyed this game, and even got my sister in on it! multiplayer is a must, and with there being a modding community, the games life is expanded further. also, hexes! i love hexes.",158.5
"civilization is a very entertaining startegy game thats light on the mind and heavy on the fun. the only thing that can take away from the fun however, is the annoying amount of repetition within the gameplay. while the repetition seems to dwindle when lpaying with friends, it is still there. an overall enjoyable expierience and unique game, civ v is a worthwhile buy. ill have to give it a 7.5/10",82.7

"great fun, very addictive, make sure you have plenty of time when playing this game as you will keep telling yourself just one more turn which can go on for hours before you realise. great fun on multiplayer as you attempt to out-do your friends economically or technologically or aid them against their enemies, or, even become their enemies.",208.9

"as with the previous civilizations fromm 1 to 4 civ 5 is an extremely addictive game. very good graphs and the amazing thing is how balanced it is compared to civ 4. from the beggining till the end of one of your games you get what i call the one more turn... disease. you need to close your pc and do your work or go to sleep and you say ok 1 more turn and ill close it. 3 hours later you watch the clock and say oh my god!.. ok 1 more turn and ill close it... highly recomended even for children, since its also an educational game, as long as you can control them! :)",108.2

"best buy you could make on steam. will give you hours and hours of fun and entertainment.",678.8
"10/10... one of my all time favorite stategy games. it comes absolutely unrivaled against any of the other strategy games i have played. picking any civilization of your choice and using them from the dawn of time to the bronze age, agricultural era, the industrial era, through to the future era economically and socially evolving through means of diplomacy, trade and war... this game is pure godlike.",112.2
"insanely fun game. its a bit slow at the beginning and its all turn-based gameplay, but once you get sucked into it, youre definitely going to be playing for many, many hours on end! the only other civilization game i played before this was civilization revolution and i dont think thats the same creators as this game cause theyre on two completely different levels. this game takes strategy to the next level across vast lands with many countries and continents to conquer! i highly, highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy games.",62.2
"start this game up, have fun for a bit, look at the clock and wonder where the last six hours went.",675.1
"this game is great and the only real cons that i think are in the game is the fact that the ai are diplomatically(they get really mad at you if you dont want to help by giving them a resource they ask for) and sometimes militarily (they mostly just throw units at you with no thought at not trying to lose one) , its hard to manage a large army of units since you cant stack them, and i always randomly get kicked from multiplayer servers. otherwise its a good sequel to a great game and is actually diffrent from the last civ. game (call of duty im looking at you)",108.2
"a great game. simple comment, but a total coverage of this game. great.",301.3
"good god this game is awesome, i usually dont like turn based games, nor strategy games, but this, this just changed my way to see things, it is way too entertaining to me to focus on that. with the expansion packs it just gets better, with religion and more in depth things. it does host to several playstyles since you can win a game from several ways, you can go from lawness and pacefulness to just complete world domination. the multiplayer is easy enough to setup, just a couple of clicks and you are playing with your friends or with strangers you choose.",45.4

"very good game! i normally dont play these type of games but i had the chance of getting it for free from someone and i said why not. i havent looked back since because this games gameplay although challenging at first and very complex to understand again at first in time becomes very useful and although i dont have brave new world, i did manage to get the gold edition upgrade recently and have discovered that getting dlc for once changes the game alot even with the ui which i find every game should do and would actually justify buying dlc now.",49.9
"i love strategy games. civilization is the leader of the pack when it comes to turn based strategy games and civ v is a worthy successor to the series. the brave new world dlc is a must-have expansion - it feels like a new game, not just an expansion pack. enjoying the broad options with civilizations and their unique abilities allows for much replay. overall - the best turn based strategy game available.",145.2
"i can lose entire weekends in this game. its a must have.",387.6
"this game is greatly time consuming which would be the only real flaw to the game if you were to ask me. overall the gameplay is smooth and is fun, really wish you could make the game a bit more fast pace and the fact there was no single player story line was kind of dissapointing. great time waster if you need that, is really fun in multiplayer and single player. great variety of playable historic people.",24.5
"this game is pretty damn addicting. it certainly has its flaws: its a bit simplistic once you understand the fundamentals. but there is enough content to keep me coming back to play",264.3
"great game. played hours and hours on it by myself and with friends.",65.8
"absolutely love civ 5. even though it is lengthy, it is definitely the best turn-based strategy pc game ive ever played. the mechanics are beautifully mastered, and the gameplay so smooth, you wouldnt even think it was turn based.",78.5
"so far have about 40 hours on this game. not much to say other than it is a good time consumer and lazy-one-handed type game game. good to play when you just want to chill, get comfy if thats your thing, and attempt to take over the world. dont think about it that much, go with the flow and build/take paths in the game that interest you. also, this is a really fun mutliplayer game. get some friends on skype and play a game, it will be the most fun youve had with friends in a while, trust me. ive been a turn based fan forever and if your into fire emblem or advanced wars and your not palying this game then your doing something wrong. go get it and nuke some cities and",71.2

"you like good turn-based games? you prefer staying at the computer all day? well, civilization v is your choise now +good gameplay +pretty cheap now +add-ons are really cool! new civilizations and game mods are included. expansion packs offer a variety of new features +multiplayer (players vs players or players vs bots etc.) -expansion packs are much more expensive than the game -civilization v without add-ons becomes boring very quickly so if you have some spare time and 2-3 friends playing this game -buy it!",110.0
"i remember playing civilization ii when i was younger and enjoyed back then. having since learned a great deal more about civics, history and cultures i know enjoy this game much more.",243.0
"over the years (and the expansions/dlcs) this game has become better and better. the one-more-turn-feeling is hard to resist and this game is as deep as it gets. i highly recommend getting the addons, as they really add to the experience. also, civ is often on sale, so that shouldnt be a problem. this game offers hundres of hours of gameplay youll love, if you like turn-based strategy games. by the way, i think that its kind of odd that people who spent more than 500h with civ claim that they cannot recommend this game",370.3
"sooo crap. cannot stand this game. i won this game and thank god i did not pay for it. i do not see what all the hype is about, and it got 90 of 100? i do not see how at all.. graphics are crap, gameplay is slow, lots of loading and pressing next turn, controls are simple click, the only good thing about this game... the videos... they look good and make the game look wow, then you get gameplay and it is nothing like that. it is press click, press next turn, click, next turn, click etc... crap utter crap. canot stand this game or games like this!",1.4
"this game causes time loss. you start the game and the next thing you know, its 8 hours later and dark outside and you missed your shift at work. it is amazing though.",240.9
"ive learnt a lot of history playing this. ive also learnt to misspell civilisation.",293.2

"civilization is such an awesome series and this games is one of its best.",59.4
"great game. youll spend endless hours playing this. the tutorial is enough to get you going. also the tips and recommendations will help you continue to learn more about the game as you play. i recommend it as a must have game for any pc gamer.",297.7
"any game that can make you spend 100+ hours withoug completing a single game and having a good time whilst doing it is good by me. although at times i do wish that the combat system was a tad bit better, just something personal though as combat is still very strategic and very rewarding.",150.6

"epic game. if you like strategy games you must have it,but you have to put up with lots of waiting turns until it gets interesting",98.0
"simply amazing. for people new to civilization, this is a very intellectual and complex strategy game that never seems to get old. one playthrough is fairly short but i come back to it about once per month and play another. you can also customize the games so much that every time the game is a little bit different and i would challenge anyone to beat it on its hardest setting. for fans of the civ series, i believe they keep getting better. graphics improvements are great but i like the unit and tech changes, i would highly recommend it. also, the leader screens are a lot more involved and interesting. sadly they removed the city view but have the city change dynamically on the map. they also removed the throne room. not sure how i feel about those but at least they put spying and religion back in, in the expansions. definitely worth the money.",155.2
"a really fun and reaxed or a heated and intense game depending on the pace and choices you make. 9/10",120.9
"i would recommend this game to anyone with two arms, a head, and a crap-load of time to play civ 5!",66.4
"sid meiers civilization v is the fifth game is the civ series. i have been playing civ since the third one when i was very young. when i was younger i couldnt grasp a lot of the concepts in the civ games. now that i am older i can understand the scope of the game. i feel that this game shows that all games arent about blood shed and guns, they are about strategy and actually using your brain. i completely recommend this game. it was worth the money completely.",168.5
"such a great game! it lasts forever! you can play a long game and have tons of fun. also, you can play with your friends online!",22.0
"pretty good but lacks innercity customization i would like",47.8

"one of the best turn-based games ive played. lots of difficulty settings so you can really test yourself and your strategies, or play a laid-back game while you watch a movie. would recommend to anyone who likes rts or maps, but vanilla only goes so far. definitely get some (if not all) of the dlc.",247.6
"vast possibilies. feeling in control. a sense of accomplishment as your ciilization expands, conquers and profits. having started in civ iv and just now picking this game up, i am no veteran but still an experienced player and i can say that this game is more than i could really have expected it to be. the game looks great, controls well and battles have been much improved from the past. my only problem with the game is that having played civ iv as mentioned earlier, it was difficult to get used to the new ui. not to worry though as the game will walk you through what everything does. in total i would have to gave civ v a hearty 8.5/10!",62.0
"this is a brilliant game if you are a fan of strategy, history and being the leader of a civilization.",793.7
"this game is a black hole. once you pass the event horizon theres no turning back...",165.6
"this has got to be one of my favorite games of all time. the different people you can be, the terrain, and even the graphics are stellar. also the ammount of modifications that people have made and will make are also off the charts amasing because not only do they enhance the game but they also allow new players to get better by practising to slowly work their way off the modifcations",239.8
"this game is extremely well built, as are the other civilizations. it is very time consuming and fun if you can be patient. with single player for the lone wolves and multiplayer for those who strive for human interaction. still, this game is, as ive already said, extremely fun.",224.3

"i purchased this game during a summer steam sale with my roommate, and had no idea what to expect. 12 hours later and we were still playing late into the morning, even with work and class just a couple hours away. while it might not have been the smartest decision of our life, this game was worth every penny and every minute of sleep lost; over 600 hours later and i still havent had close to enough. whether youre a newcomer to the series or a civilization veteran, i cant recommend this game anymore highly to anyone who thinks they have the capacity to enjoy a solid rts. the expansions of gods & kinds and especially brave new world add many needed mechanics and empires that turn an incredible game into an amazing masterpiece, great for singleplayer and multiplayer fans alike.",871.8

"civilization v continues the new look of civilization series. many upgrades from civ iv include hexagonal grid, cities fighting back, one unit per tile and so forth. the game is positive upgrade from civ iv and along with the new expansions gnk and bnw the game adds much more elements to the gameplay. overall the game is great. one more turn.",476.8
"i can honestly say that there are only a handful of features that previous versions had that this one would benifit from; quite the dramatic improvement given at launch i really only played it over 4 for the hexes.",621.4
"im using the gods and kings expansion and i havent had a life since i installed it. there are a couple buggy glitches with the mac version but theyre not insurmountable or so egregious that they cant be overlooked. beautiful imagery whether on full tilt or not. it can feel a little tedious but a lot of the features can be turned off to make game play faster. ive played older versions before and loved it then. the only thing that would make it better is to play with someone. eeryone else seems to be stuck in a first person shooter type game so i dont have many options. great game, i encourage you to play.",162.9
"this things...eat will eat your soul (and your time). but its worth it. theres just something....rivetting about stomping through a line of knights with a giant death robot. though, you may want to edit the game so the ai doesnt use nukes....the ai isnt very smart and pretty much ww3 starts the minute more than three ai-controlled civilizations get atomic weapons. .....i mean, theyre nukes you dont throw em around like their cruise missiles... ps: all hail illutian, all hail britannia!",132.4

"seemingly simple on the surface, subtly complex. a great civ game, even though it strays from the gameplay styles of its predecessors.",246.8

"blow up horsemen and archers with giant death robots and nukes! do it now!",104.5
"hard to see the need to review the game as the series overall speaks for itself and you either love it or youve never played it. ;) in particular with the brave new world expansion it finally feels like theyve gotten the game to the same level as the best of its predecessors.",303.8
"totally worth. ive gotten so much play time out of this and i still jump at the chance to play it. the mods you can find out there for it add some extra play value too. it, even the basic, is worth getting",235.6
"the game gets way more fun after installing a few mods. now the great and powerful trixie is taking over ussr, accompanied by hitler himself. now thats what i call a strategy game.",516.9
"its not as good as civ iv but its still pretty good. couple things they got rid of that i miss. no more unit stacking, the hexes instead of squares, and the elimination of the science bar. i miss those features. i still recommend it.",54.4

"a really good game, however ive noticed if i dont quick save after a certain amount of time it shuts down on me for no reason.",14.9
"probably the only game that i can pickup and play at a moments notice whilst still having the most complicated epicly long games where each game is utterly different. this game never gets old. worth every penny",74.4
"great game if you love to take your time doing research or going for all out war and domination. takes you by suprise how good it looks.",14.1
"i got hooked in my first play session, totally amazing. a must buy to everyone!",26.8
"ive been a fan of civilization all the way back to the first or second one. while my favorite one in the series still stands to be civilization colonization. this one stands true to the ways of civilization with adding even more if you get it on steam. the workshop aids it in its everlasting glory of timeless fun for all who play it. while the multiplayer can be glitchy and sometimes unreliable in the beginning of a game, or with people all across the u.s. (eu cannot play matches with the us on multiplayer unless you join through steam)i still recommend it in every situation although you may need to watch out if you dont like spending hours being drawn into one match. graphics: 8 (for a civ game) gameplay: 8 (10 with bnw) performance: 7.5 (took a hit in multiplayer because of connection, thats about it) overall: 8",148.2
"one of the most addictive game i have ever played. and i must say i always like to come back to it.",294.0
"the onlt thing that would make this game better is a steam for linux port! 4.5 stars!",203.0
"this game its a strategy and history one. it worth every dollar that you spend. i played this games serveral days trying all the civilizations and i didnt get bored , and thats strange because i always get bored of a game in 2-3 days , but there are some games that makes me to play them and this one is one of them so you should buy this game because , it worth .",6.8
"civ v and the civ games in general are really great strategy games!",58.9
"this game is really good. if you like strategy games, this is what you want. however, if youre impatient, you may not want it, because the loading times are quite long and the turn based system can be a little clunky. nonetheless, it is worth every penny, and if you get it, definitely go for the expanded pack.",29.8
"amazing, epic game feel, tons of stuff in game, great multiplayer setup.",77.3
"this game will ruin your social life, but will leave you very satisfied afterwards",117.7
"so much fun! such long games ... cant.stop.playing",92.7
"the civilization series is on that i always come back to when i get bored with the latest and greatest game. its one of the few remaining series that knows what it does best. i am really enjoy playing this game.",93.0
"this game has stolen hundreds of hours of my life from me- and i dont regret a single minute. :)",823.1
"a great game that will make you stick to it for hours, but best suited for those who like strategy games",461.6
"gold edition doesnt include brave new world. very misleading. its a good way of ing me out of a few extra dollars though.",72.6
"building empires and conquering the world has never been so much fun!",58.2
"civilation 5 is a game that says what it dose multple ways to win all sorts of countries to play as trade routs with other city states/civilations and happynes",41.4
"addictively fun with streamlined options for faster gameplay with the civ feel.",513.6
"i know its been said before, but if you have anything important anytime soon, dont play this game! you will play until you should have left and not even realize it. its always just one more turn.",359.7
"great game, i would reccommend everyone gives it a try",36.2
"the best thing i liked about this game was the realistic approach towards battle and improvements in a country of your choice. if you have the dlc for this game it gets even better! not only does one understand and go through a learning process since the beginning of time and how war was waged and how countries and small states had alliances with each other but you get to make your decisions and they effect you in the long run. you can play a short game starting from the nuclear era and nuke cities and civilizations or you can go back all the way when iron and coal was found and work your way up into a new era! superb game with great and realistic rulers, buildings, monuments, wonders and warfare. a must if you like strategy games or were a fan of games like generals. but believe me, this is way ahead of generals or any civilization game you have ever played !",34.3
"became a great entry with the gods and kings expansion. not worth it without it. if youre not interested in spending that much money, pick up iv gold.",72.1
"great game with many strategy elements. its a ton of fun, and totally worth the price.",339.9
"i like this game alot. there are quite a few ways to win at the game and all of them have their own ineresting aspects of it but i do suggest if you get the game to get gods and kings too. the vanilla version has pretty bad ai so their armies could sit att their base during a large part of the game but they get better in the gods and kings expansion. in brave new world it adds onto cultural victory and allows you to benefeit off of money even more. the ai also get more intelligent in the gods and kings expansion as well.",372.2
"fantastic game, better with the expansions. so fun to play.",145.0
"engrossing, worthy of the civiliaztion legacy. the hexes and stack removal make it very much more like a traditional tabletop wargame, something which i found enjoyable.",129.2
"great game! best money spent on a game so far with this account.",28.0
"great game. bugs need a bit of a sorting out and sometimes make the game not as fun but all together a fantastic experience. i would suggest civ 5 for all micro-management strategy fans out there.",111.4
"250h+ and still so much to learn, play and do! start with just civ5 and move to the expansions as you get bored with the mechanic and switch it up!",235.8
"got the basis civ for 19 euro, and goty update for 10 euro, all well worth it. game is fun as usual.",99.4
"civilization 5 is a great stragety game that can entertain for years. there are many things you can do in this game. i recommend it whole heartedly.",643.2
"its really fun. i dont think its fun without the gods and kings dlc. (havent gotten it yet but looking forward to it). there are many achievements as well.",511.4
"a true overhaul of the civilization franchise. this game brings in big changes. the most notable being the hex-based gameplay and the removal of unit stacking. those two things greatly change the way you play the game, and definitally for the better. the overlay is improved, and now when you end your turn the game doesnt pull you to each city and force you to choose what building/unit to build. which is a small, but much needed improvement. the new systems also make smaller empires more vialbe. being the biggest and baddest empire is no longer the primary concern. the game also makes it very easy to download and install mods, which further improves the game. its good, and feels like civilization while still offering a fresh experience.",174.5
"this game is really amazing if you play it with friends or add a few mods",226.9
"positives: diplomacy is very strong, combat is fluid, very balanced among ai and players, large variety of nations, use of steam workshop, can set up games to your liking and use of historical figures negatives: branching paths of upgrades could have been upgraded a bit more(too small), city-states have very little usefulness aside from getting a new unit every once in a while, and even though certain leaders have a specialized unit, they are actually the same as a normal one. verdict: 8.75/10 recommendation: to those with too much time on their hands. get it. now.",62.7
"this game is my favourite turn based strategy game i have ever play i would recommend this game to anyone who is in to any type of strategy game and has never played this.",6.4
"extremely addictive and time consuming game, you can play for hours and not realise because youre having that much fun!",27.0
"this game is way too addicting. one... more... turn...",48.0

"one of the best games ive ever plyed, very relaxing and fun",318.2
"if you could take your  and  any game... it would be this game.. trust me ive done it, real nice.",355.1
"it is just to good! i bought it last weekend and already have 30 hours in it. if u can buy this game",184.0
"great game you can hours of fun and not even know it. all and all great game just wish it had a battle ground camra feature.",43.7
"this game is great to not only play alone but to also have a marathon with a couple of mates. worth every dollar and never gets old.",251.5
"this is a great game for a parent of a high maintenance infant. the game is turn based and will patiently wait for you to feed and change your kid. then come back and pick up where you left off!",62.4
"yes, yes, yes, yes, ... yes. if you are even just a little bit curious about this genre just try it. this game goes on sale often so if you dont want to pay the 30 dollar price tag because your not sure you can easily wait. although, in my opinion it is easily worth $100. you will lose your life with this game, you have been warned.",65.0
"very fun game to play on both singleplayer and multiplayer. great strategy game that allows you to test different scenarios that you choose to craft. highly recommended to you guys!",463.5
"this game is amazingly addictive... buy it! it has insane replayability, and you can download thousands of addons from the steam workshop to change the game for when (if) you actually do get bored of playing it.",231.0
"this is one of those games i always find myself coming back to year after year. who doesnt like to start up a game vs. the cpu or vs. a family member and imagine the world domination machinations of ghandi or george washington. the games can go on for awhile or just a day but it never stops being fun to take over the world whether your favorite victory is military, cultural or through overt capitalism.",192.1
"a very addicting game. just a great, wich you need to buy !!",158.8
"originally i was very sceptical - for me version v had come way too fast after civ iv which i liked very. i changed my mind with the gods & kings expansion and now it is by far the most played game in my list. the gameplay is superb and i very much enjoy the co-op mode. there is no excuse not to own and play this game, as it is eternally replayable.",424.9
"been an avid player of civilization series since the very beginning on the amiga. a great addition to the series and a worthwhile buy for anyone who wishes to lose a weekend one does not simply play civilization for an hour",343.9
"8/10 very fun game but can get slightly repetitive.",58.0
"highly, fun turn base easy to understand and hours and hours of play.",188.3
"fantastic game! can spend hours and hours playing!!!",269.6
"i love anything civ, but after 3-5 here, they are going to have to come up with some new stuff to keep this series going, they are just messing with ai, ui, leaders at this point and some skill tree stuff. not sure if i will bother with a civ6 unless i see some innovation otherwise im just buying the same product over and over again.",378.5
"ive loved every civilization game since i played civilization iii way back in the day. the scope of these games has always impressed me, and civ 5 does not disappoint in this regard. some die hard civ players were taken aback from the hex-combat mechanic of the game, but personally, i think that the change was a step in the right direction, making me not dread waging war with my neighbors (which in previous civ games always felt like a chore.) the base game is fun, but ive found that the two major expansions really have improved the experience (gods and kings and brave new world). brave new world, especially, is an excellent addition to the cultural victory scenarios. civ 5 is the most played game in my small steam collection, and with the wide array of mods and community support, it will probably stay that way for years to come.",295.2
"so addicting...i cant stop playing....this game cant be healthy for you. so much fun!!!",102.6
"civilization is awesome. the unique problem is to stop playing it. its too addictive. it should be prohibited.",257.0
"i picked up civ v because i have played the previous versions of civ. i love the new graphics. i find the new elements being added with the expansion/dlc very interesting. i do wish that there was a way to turn them off if you want to go back to the base game.",337.6
"while i love the game, i wish they wouldve captured the personality of the leaders more in actual gameplay. ghandi gets pretty aggressive, and im pretty sure he didnt roll like that.",67.0
"a very nice and enjoyable game. but my favorite best of the series remains civ2.",77.8
"one of *the* best civ games to have been released. with the dlc, civ v is better than its predecessors.",39.5
"ing buy it so i have someone to play online you s!!!",158.8
"very deep strategy game with complex systems to master. civ v has done a great job expanding on its concept and reimagining key features from past entries that have really brought this current rendition into the best the series has to offer to date.",9.9
"awesome game! not as much micromanagement as civ iv but for me that is a good thing.",171.1
"10/10 would bang this game is so good it gives me an erection",151.3
"easy to get into, surprising level of sophistication, every game is different. its hard to stop playing!",386.4
"i love the civilization series so much. so intoxicatingly addictive that you just cannot stop playing. i would highly recommend the bnw expansion with 5 as it really improves the game.",285.4
"one unit per hex, combined with the fact that a nations capital has the same size as a company of archers makes for unintuitive cringe-worthy gameplay. on the plus side it looks good enough to make civ iv annoying to play.",13.0
"this game is wonderful the series has been running for ages and it is 10/10.",138.6
"weve got better things to do you . p.s :p::a::y::thed::a::y: is better",51.8
"ive had it ever since it came out and it is still one of my favorite games of all time. bnw is awesome and g&k is also awesome.",319.7
"if you are one of the few people that havent tried a civ game, you really should try it. with a low barrier of entry and high levels of management once you feel comfortable with the systems, it is a grand strategy game that can appeal to almost anyone. with dlc that only fleshes out the experience, this game is good vanilla or otherwise. multiplayer started off slowly, but seems to be working fine, and that is great news, as the game can quickly feel as though youre playing a board game with a group of friends. try it, and im sure youll see why this game has been a favorite of so many for so long.",110.9
"amazing and very fulfilling game, and not too complex.",676.0
"this game is a huge time-sink, and for all the right reasons! each game you play, wether multiplayer or against the excellently done a.i will provide hours upon hours of strategic challenges and an excellent system of micromanagement. with the several different victory conditions and tons of different civilizations to play (each with their own unique bonuses, units and buildings) this game caters for every possible strategy. definitely a recommended game - civ 5 is a great play for veterans of the series and for newcomers.",277.1
"great game as long as you have paitence and dont quit like 20mins into the game. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gods & kings is a great expansion adding religon, new units, new civs, espionage, new buildings, new tecs. five stars sid meier much better than the clustered insanity of alpha centari.",230.6
"an amazing game that may take a lot of time out of your day,but playing with the right friends will make this game the funnest it could be.",41.4
"the hex grid combat made combat more dynamic but the overall ga,e dept suffered before any expansions. after brave new world and gods and kings wererelease the game became a complete experice. many of the smal;l dlc felt like nickle and dimeing the gamer. they should have been added to the base game. but the game is stupid addictive and deep. so i give it a remomendation.",295.5
"the most epic game ive ever played (and i have minecraft)",173.2
"very fun game, but i feel that it is a lot better with some of the dlc",24.4
"really, the best part about brave new world is that its finally addressed every victory condition in the game and made each one not only more equally viable, but also just as busy. weaponizing culture works to bring it more in line with the other conditionsits something you have to work towards and not something you just happen to achieve. on top of that, the diplomacy changes make this system more interesting as well, and it all comes down to one thing: if you have civilization v and want to play more, you owe it to yourself to get this expansion.",152.4
"this game is fun. countless hours of enjoyment await you if you decide to play it. i prefer to play eith others, but this game still manages to pull me in for times when im alone.",3.0
"one more turn you will never sleep again. this game is incredibly fun, but very addicting. watch our for ghandi, hes a backstabber.",161.1
"your people get extremely pissed if you build 2 cities, otherwise great game",83.6
"i cannot tell you how easy it is to get sucked into this game. look at the clock and realize youve been playing for hours on a single match. civ has always been the definition of turn based strategy games, and civ 5 holds true to that statement/ simply marvelous.",133.5
"one of the best turn base strategy games ever created. if youre into stategy games than this is a must!",543.4
"this game kicks major butt. i play it for hours and get lost in its amazingness. be any civilization from a wide array of choices and seize control of the world by whatever means you choose. its definitely a play the way you want game. i cant wait to get ahold of the dlc for this game.",48.0
"one of the best games i ever played o.o extremely addictive and hard which makes it a must-play!",197.4
"i play this game a little bit. highly recommended.",670.5
"this series is always in my top 5 most loved games.",776.6
"if this game were a potato, it would be a good potato.",242.2
"civ v is pretty much everything you could want from an rts. the vanilla version alone is amazing, but if you can get your hands on gods and kings, you can sink hours upon hours into this without it feeling stale or repetitive. none of the leaders is particularly overpowered, so there should be one that matches your playstyle well. oh, and the fact that the steam community pumps out mods for the game like crazy makes it super easy to adapt this to whatever setting you like (fantasy, sci-fi, etc.)",48.3
"just plain one of the best strategy games/ series ever. i used to hate turn based games till i found civ!",16.2
"best game ever..................if youve got all day with nothing to do... :p",442.3
"i remember being captivated by civ1 back in high school while at a friends house. when civ2 was released, it dropped my college gpa possibly a whole point - it was that good. civ5 has taken the franchise to new heights. most of the annoyances are gone and there are many new facets of gameplay to explore like the faith system. im a little late to this game - its been out for a while but i really regret not purchasing this game earlier.",105.4
"absolutely everything you want it to be. the biggest change from previous civ games is to the actual placement of troops on the field -- units can no longer stack. the non-stacking may sound like a nerf, but it adds a new level of strategy to the game where you could previously just throw a huge stack of units at the enemy. the math-hammer is gone, and the game now plays more like chess. its a very simple improvement, but it really makes the game.",291.7
"an inviting strategy game that guarantees a gratifying experience.",59.0
"civilization v is a fantastic game for the turn-based gamer inside everyone. filled with content to the brim and great dlc expansions, this game is a must own.",7.0
"its bigger, better and even more time consuming. its civilization! chariots vs tanks, what more can you want?",200.0
"veryy good game. amazing with friends but also very good for playing alone.",524.1
"great and addictive game, but has a lot of bugs. this game sometimes is disappointing, but worths of buying for 12.5 euro.",89.2
"really great game to play with a group of mates. better over lan however as it can take a while to do all the turns.",104.4
"amazing game, good time waster and great dlc. reccomended to anyone!",67.4
"pretty good. but games take days to complete and are repetitive.",106.0
"its good if you like to click next turn over and over!",175.1
"why would i need to recommend this game? if you dont have it, then i can only assume youve only just reared your head from under a rock...",134.7
"a very good turn base strategy game. basically you must guide your civilization from stone age to the future land. during the game you need to defeat your enemies using weapons or culture. if you like strategy games but your have not good reflexings for real time strategy games then it is a great option. olhausen",69.4
"it is one of my favorite games cant wait to get it.",179.7
"who are you and why havent you bought this game!?",424.0
"very fun game with hours of gameplay to be had. very simple to learn and will be enjoyed by all rts fans",159.4
"ive put over 300 hours into this game. while immensely sad, that does say a lot about how great a game it is.",523.6
"the game. i cant really think of anything i dont like about this game :-) the only drawback is quite unstable multiplayer (which also doesnt support mods unfortunately).",1023.5
"pros: great music, intriguing history quotes, epic intros :d, vast gamplay variety, addictive gamplay, challenging to noobish gameplay difficulties, incredible single player. cons: insanely long normal game, lack of popular multiplayer, long progress systems, hard to find and complex world editor. score: 87.98% reviewed during 2013 holiday sale",83.0
"great game, and very fun to gather a lot of friends to play it with",27.4
"amazing strategy game! so fun to play, endless amounts of fun. it doesnt need a good computer to play on, nor is it too hard to understand when you first get into it! i recommend everyone that is getting into pc or strategy games to play this game first, youll learn so much and develop your skills so much!",76.1
"best game ever! (except for civ iv, iii, ii or the original civ.) ive lost days and days and days to this game series. more addictive than peanut butter covered crack cocaine. oh go on then... one more turn...",73.3
"this game is simply amazing! love it! beat the game 2 on prince, thrice on king , and failed epicaly at godmode. the mechanics and gameplay are immersive and flow like a nose on a cold day. i got a black friday deal that go tme civ 5 and the gold edition for $19.99. () like a boss. the bottom line is, get this fricking game.",45.9
"very enjoyable strategic game. the expansions add a large amount of gameplay elements that increase the quality of an already amazing game. there are some issues with ai not being very smart, and high difficulties working through handicaps, but its an enjoyable game. 8.5/10",390.8
"civ 5 is a smooth, turn-based strategy game about building your empire from the ground up. along the way youll face invading barbarians and other nations, some will help you, some will harm you. i highly reccomend this game, but get all the main dlc, without them the game is pretty trash. 10/10",314.4
"a great addition to the sid meier legacy. the new one unit per tile system is frequently frustrating, but introduces a new stratey angle to the combat system that makes combat much more engaging",326.0
"a lot simpler in the lines of civ revolution that hit the consoles. makes it easy for anyone to pick up and play. just wish it wasnt soooooo time consuming",1.6
"i loved this game you can control how the world is shaped you can make your own history what you do in 500 b.c. could change things in 500 a.d. i recommend this game",426.4
"great game, loads of fun to play. can be confusing if you dont know what youre doing at first, so i recommend watching a tutorial video first. but great game all around especially if you enjoy strategy games.",144.7
"ive only started playing the civilization series with iv. that being said this game is by far the best in the series for me at least. no more stacks of doom where you drag around 30 units on a single tile. real strategy during combat takes place and using the terrain is essential to victory. my fav strategy game by far.",480.6
"awesome, game with a great mod community. be careful, nine hours might pass before you know when playing this game.",24.2
"excellent, huge improvement over the last version!",85.6
"you cant go wrong with the civilization series. all the dlc is great too, and worth purchasing.",596.5
"one of the best turn base strategy game of all time!",28.6

"not as good as iv but still a good game. better graphics and it has some better features.",210.9
"i highly recomment this game. i am so addicted. i origianlly got this game on a dare. when i played it i put in 21 hours in two days so i highly recommend this game for any type of game 10 out 10",155.7

"truly amazing gameplay, immersive landscapes, and an engaging combat style make this game one of my favorites!",11.0
"this game is probably one of the best games i have ever played. never gets old! even without dlc! highly reccomended.",233.8
"great game cool factions. but it needs canada. canada has had a huge history and if the states made it so should canada",215.3
"addicting, immersive and challenging. this is one of my favorite series of all time and the reason for many late nights. maybe a slight learning curve if your new, though experienced players will feel right at home. excellent addition to the series!",20.4
"though i have a small play time i find it fun now and again to create a quick game and take over the world :)",8.3
"finally up to snuff after the brave new world dlc. worth another look if you havent played since the original launch.",107.6
"i started playing the civilization series from version 1 when i was a kid (back when games came in boxes and had big instruction manuals) and have been hooked ever since. civ 5 is great game and still feels fresh after all these years however the game does crash frequently which really ruins the immersion. that said once a game has started kiss goodbye to at least 24 hours of your life!",35.4
"great game. very addicting on sale for $15 dollars! i dont regret buying at full price",127.4
"civ 5 is just a awesome game in general and with its xpacs (gods and kings + brave new world) the game is on steroids... with the introduction to faith / trade routes / tourism / revamped social policies / archaeology / new units are added for every era / more civs / more city states (faith / mercantile) / more luxury resources / more great people (admirals / writers / musicians) spys (engage in espionage and steal other civiliazations tech or make them diplomates and spread propaganda about the wonders and glory your empire is) world congress (vote new laws for the world.. embargo hostile civs or usher in grows in science or art) the game has totally changed in terms of strategy; more angles, more possibilies, more fun!",404.9
"excellent game!! the ultimate turn-based strategy pc game.",145.6
"if you want the same feeling as being hooked on heroin for a fraction of the cost, buy this game and every dlc.",370.2
"a turn based game where you build up an empire with armies, cities, and other factors. the game is played on a risk-style board, but is nothing compared to risk. this game is good, but can become tiresome after a few games, and seems to require a cooldown before you want to go back in. this game is good for people who like turn based strategy and nation building that can be totally different each time you play.",45.4
"its civ, more streamlined, but still grand in scale and a great killer of time. brave new world has made it more complete than the vanilla version, making it one of the best games in the past two years.",63.0
"awesome game for people who enjoy strategy world domination games.",188.5
"on no account get this game if you have incredibly important exams imminent. it will take over your life.",276.7
"the learning curve has some steep spots on this one - at difficulty 3, no matter how much i harass someone, they wont declare war on me, while at level 4, people are trying to wipe me off the map early and often. (ive been told i have abysmally bad luck when it comes to spawning next to warmongers.) but it just makes it that much more rewarding when you manage to hold off everyone long enough to win.",608.6
"great graphics and its nice that i can choose from a lot of different options to get different game plays. i never tire of this game.",692.3
"this game never gets boring. with 250+ achievements, you will literally never run out of ways to play it. endless map variations, resource spots and enemies. with constant dlcs being added, winning becomes more and more varied, used to be either domination or a space race, i was surprised at the many new ways to win. multiplayer is still slow as hell, but again never boring. making offline custom games is my thing. you can customise almost everything, maps, leaders, resources, time periods, difficulty...etc. the list goes on and on. if you are a fan of the civilization series, then this is the one for you, dont hesitate, youll never regret it.",125.8
"how do i recommend this? all i know is that i enjoy it, being a highly technically advanced civ with enough firepower to send everyone to the stone age... if they werent already there.",535.4
"great game especially for turn-based strategy players. i highly recommend this game for great gameplay, strategy,and replay value. with almost infinite replay value and the many dlcs and add-ons i think civ 5 will be the best of the series yet.",115.7
"gets rid of some of the annoyances of previous civilization games while maintaining a classic feel. i highly recommend this to any civ fan.",83.2
"its literally one of the best games on steam, and is by far probably the game that ive logged the most steam hours on.",524.0

"i knew i was ment to rule the world. {evil laugh} this is a pretty laid back, turn based game. its fun :d",74.1
"for kicking back and playing strategy world domination, this game rocks. nothing comes close to choosing your best leader based on how you like to play, then smoothly take the entire world like candy from a baby. this game rocks. eates up some cpus in the longer games, but it just cant be beat.",892.4
"simply one of the best strategy games of all times! its just too addictive! and to the newcomers, buy it! you wont regret!",61.1
"sid meiers civilization v is a game that has attempted something that very little games ttempt to do, and that is to have someone create an empire, and make that empire stay, despite war, religion, politics, money. a great imrpovement from the fourth version of this game, the fifth bersion, right now, manages to remove the stacking of units, and add tons of new troops, new technologies, new empires and their leaders, and is an all out better game than before. this is the thing that will be last compared to a waste of money.",133.3
"an amazing strategy game. fun for hours (150+ on record). make sure to try out each different victory type so that you dont just settle for one. fun to play with friends and alone alike!",228.9
"as a man who has put in weeks worth of time into this game i can say it is more than worth it. though the expansion packs are a bit pricey they make the game so much more enjoyable. this is a game you can lose a whole day playing. 10 out of 10, would bang.",543.7

"its a great time killer. can be pretty in-depth and enjoyable. i recommend for fans of the series and for those who are new to it.",11.9
"civ 5 is very addictive since brave new world came out. the ai can be buggy and the game can have some balacing issues, but its not enough to distract from how much i love this game.",1045.2
"im following the series since the first game and i still love it, nice evolution over the past game. highly recommended but be advice that this game is highly addictived and will take away a lot of your time.",519.6

"streamlined for fast fun, the most approachable civilization yet.",306.4
"its hard not to enjoy the civilization games, and this is so far my favorite. the expansions make it even better.",330.1
"a turn based strategy game based on earths history itself. history is presented in an anachronism stew, but that is one of the charming aspects of the civilization series. absolutely brilliant game design and some of the most addictive fun ive had in a video game.",157.3
"this chapter of civilization, innovates and changes the mechanics of the previous chapters. the game has changed, but retains the charm of the civilization series!",287.1
"fantastic game, doesnt take a bunch of skill to have fun",32.5
"although i miss a few things from civ 4, its an amazing game from an amazing series. since no-ones ever made a remake of alpha centauri, this is the best 5x game.",332.9
"great turn-based strategy game with tons of dlc and scenarios that are never the same! best when played with friends.",43.7
"civilization has been my favorite game since the original! over time it has become better and better, cumulating in civ-v! with the most current expansion, it brings the best of everything from combat, to culture, to economics and trade. if you enjoy resoure management strategy games, civ will be the only game that can satisfy!",335.7
"yessssssssssssssss. my precioussssssssss game issssss beautiful.",75.6
"an addictive and fun turn based strategy game in which you grow a civilazation from the beginning of mankind to the future. more than worth $20 and offers cheap dlcs, i bought the denmark vikings dlc and love it.",62.5
"oh hell yes! this game will consume your life, but youll love every damn second of it",141.7
"this game is awesome. i admit i have a little obsession with this one. its one of them games where you loose half the day before realize you havent eaten or even gone to the bathroom. its turn based strategy at its best. and who doesnt like to conquer the world?",504.2
"good game for people who like controling world! :d",23.7
"if you like board games or stradegy games this is 4 u!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",97.8
"i think we can all agree that civ will always stand amongst (or even at) the top of the grand strategy genre. also... the dutch are overpowered... freaking polders...",283.8
"great game a lot of fun to play! very detailed graphics smooth game play. just good all around game.",827.4
"hands down: best civ ever! and it gets better with every expansion pack. never played civilization? then you missed out on a lot. but dont worry, just start with civ v, its awesome.",674.9
"if you can spend the time to install all the mass effect mods. have fun destroying the krogans xd",37.4
"civ 5 is a excellent contuination of an amazing rts game. although some games can feel like they go on forever, it is still an amazing game to sink your time into",159.0
"this, in my opinion, is the first civ to surpass civ 2. the first was like the first in any new type of game, something that opened everyone up, but it also had many flaws. when it came to civ 2 they found the sweet spot. upon creating the third they added way too many new things that broadened the game, but at release it too many bugs. so arguably civ 3 could have surpassed its predecessor. civ 4, like what they brought to consoles (civ revolution) was made too user friendly and didnt allow you to get deeper in strategy beyond build cities build units. civ 5, they got it all right.",91.7
"this is simply one of the best games (if not the best game) ive ever played. for new players, the long game span may be quite intimidating, but if you start out on easy with the tutorial on, its very simple to understand. if i were to verbalize every feature that i like about this game, it would probably be several pages long, so ill keep it concise by saying that there is almost nothing i dislike about this game.",324.7
"i have always loved the civilization series but was a little apprehensive about the dramatic changes civ v was making to the series. however, after playing for several hundred hours i have come to love the changes. civ iv is a wonderful game and always will be but is probably the pinnacle of what could be achieved with the old civ gameplay (stackable units, etc.). civ v makes several changes that require you to play differently but introduce lots of new strategic options which brings new life to the series. i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves strategic games.",695.4
"this is a great, fun game that is fun not only in singleplayer and multiplayer. overall a great strategy game. :)",236.1
"i play this game for very long hours however they are place for several improvment for example you have very limited option to do with the other empire or when you demand stuff you cant change the 30 turn policy ?! so i am hoping to see the next generation of the game much better than this one",93.2
"oh man. have you played this in game? no? what is your problem asshat? buy this game now or you should just hang yourself. god. 10/10",175.7
"the game is great. not as better as age of empires but still a great game. money well spent on this game.",201.3
"dammit, i love this game too much! in my mind, this game has the highest replayablity of any game ive played! this was my first steam game and i dont think ill ever have the heart to uninstall it. pros: good graphics in depth gameplay religion system greatly increases replayability high replayability low cost cons: most multiplayer matches require more dlcs bugs with graphics",92.7
"sid meiers civilization v is one of the best games i have ever played. whether you win by diplomacy, domination, science, etc, you always feel that sense of accomplishment inside. gods and kings adds a number of great civilizations to play as and meet, along with the addition of espionage and religion. the elements added to the original game are useful and fun to use. brave new world adds a very interesting element to the game, completely changing the diplomatic victory. a very fun expansion, and well worth the price. sid meiers civilization v and its expansions are all worth the price they are listed. i would recommend buying the gold edition for the game, or buying the gold edition upgrade, as they are the same price.",178.7
"very addicting. never count on allied npc countries helping you, though. you are on your own.",708.2
"an amazing game that only is benefitted by its gods and kings expansion and the extra civilization dlcs. i started back with civiii, and im still going strong with the series. sid meiers civilization is the mother of all god games, where you are able to control everything about your country, from the big picture of scientific research and diplomacy to the micromanagement of individual citizens and soldiers. definitely at least try the game.",510.4
"if you want real strategy, this game is it. after 15 hours youll still have things to research, be it military or infrastructure improvement. its complexity is flawless; like managing your own country. 10/10 buy it.",68.7
"great game to play. i can lose myself in this game for hours. just bought the brave new world expansion as well. adding more elements to the game. so many ways to win a game. ai to me doesnt seem completely stupid. fun if your looking to play against the ai, at least for me. havent played much online yet. but i am willing to bet its just as good.",35.5
"hours and hours of fun... just make sure you have hours and hours to play it. you can save at any time, but its one of those games youll intend on playing for 30 minutes, and instead staying up for 3 hours with it.",26.2
"pretty fun, good stratergy and great game when you want to zone out",40.7
"this game is an awesome strategy game. for those chess players who like to build like in games like minecraft. pros- in depth gameplay. multilple difficulties, various game modes. always expanding and you can always find a mod to build whatever world or civ you want. con- lengthy for anyone who only wants to play for short periods. some civs are imba and others stink.",623.7
"perhaps one of my all time favorite games. whether it be peacefully gliding your way to victory or crumbling everyone in your path to global domination, its always a blast!",189.4
"one does not simply play this game for less than half an hour in one sitting.",33.2
"get this game. even if youre not into strategy games, theres something youll enjoy here. its addictive. this and civ 3 are the only games ive played recently where i completely lost track of time for hours on end. theres always something for you to do, and if you somehow get bored with the base game, there are lots of mods for it that add new units, civilizations, scenarios, and even total conversions for various fictional universes, like the future mod and the middle earth mod. at $12.50, its definitely worth it.",134.7
"an amazing turn based strategy game. if you have played any of the previous civ games and havent played this one what are you waiting for?! if you havent played any civ game its easy to pick it up and learn. its fun and addicting and will continue to be enjoyable after days of playing.",24.4
"if you are a fan of the civ series then you will probably like this game.",68.3
"i have no regrets buying this game and every single dlc. worth my time and every singe dollar. although it could use some bug fixes, a ranking system and more realism no doubt one of the best games ive ever played.",598.8
"sure, it starts out slow, but once you take out an entire nation you know, you just know, that this game was made for you.",71.2
"this game was a bust at the begining. but the 2 expension make it wothwhile. for sure, everything is streamline. it minimize the micromanagement. unfortunatly, at the higher level of play the ai is not better, it just get some bonus over the player. overall a good buy when on special.",675.6
"such a fun game to play for anyone -- very rewarding.",28.8
"although i feel that this game has been a bit simplified since civilization iv, it is still a fantastic and addicting experience! at first i was disappointed with what was removed from the vanilla game (such as religion and espionage), but it was remedied with both brave new world and gods and kings. the multitude of civilizations available means that one can never run out of strategies in their quest for their nation to stand the test of time!",301.2
"kill your friends. kill your enemies. but most importantly, kill time. seriously, this game makes plane rides go by like theyre nothing.",216.4
"civilization 5 is yet another masterpiece to add to sid meiers legacy. it has nailed down everything from engaging graphics and gameplay to witty little historical tidbits you pick up about given civilizations. i like the simplification of some systems like cultural land aquisition while the complexity of others like religion, trade routes, and tourism. overall, civ 5 gets a 10/10 from me.",323.9
"this is my favorite game in the world. it will consume your life and youll play it instead of living your life. which is fine because you dont have anything going on anyway.",355.1
"it took me a long time from buying and downloading civilization v to actually playing it. theres a reason behind it, which is i never liked turn-based games. it took me a long time to actually give this game a try, and boy do i regret that it took me so long. without a shadow of doubt, civilization v is among the best games i have ever played. i absolutely love it.",811.6
"im normally not a big fan of these types of strategy games with my add... but i ended up putting in 100+ hrs on this bad boy! great game for a newcomer to the series. pros: easy to get in to and the learning curve was more forgiving than i thought it might be cons: the diplomacy aspect of the game was non-existent and winning by the new brave new world options was very complicated",74.2
"this is a great game. always enjoyable to play whenever your bored. dlc is great too.",191.3
"relive the sacking of rome, the great depression, and operation iraqi freedom - but with twice the fun and only half of the regret.",153.6
"sid meirs civilization v is a amazing game, peroid.",211.8
"really fun with friends and also very stratigical online mulitplayer.",122.7
"sid meiers civilization v is a very fun game for people who are interested in strategy games, but you probably already heard it before if you are in to these kinds of games. i dont play strategy a lot, and each game requires a lot of time commitment, which i dont have.",56.2
"emmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i like this game its good graphic if you like strategy you must try this game :)",45.9
"great strategy game, a bit laggy in the advanced stages of the game. turns from a swift strategy game into a lagging monstosity rather quickly. everything upto that point is more than fine though",93.4
"this game speeds up time around you. look at the clock and then play some civ then look back, and i guarantee you that at least 3 hours will have passed. i have already lost 35 hours of my life to this phenomenom and i expect i will lose many more. 10/10",42.1
"garbage. ... and dont believe the hype, brave new world has exactly the same fundamental flaws as the base game.",31.0
"i have owned this game for about a month, maybe a little more and it is one of my favorites until recently (not saying it isnt good but this is really annoying, still love the game) when whenever i try to load up a save or start a new game, it crashes. besides that annoying aspect, the game is amazing and if you dont own it (one of my friends), buy it.",347.6
"i played this game for close to 30 hours over a 2 week period when i made my new computer. its that good.",260.6

"this game helps with strategy and lots of planing through",15.1
"love this game, have played all in the series. 5/5",71.2
"civ has always been one of my favorite games. civ v does not disapoint. good graphics, more deplomacy chioces, and lots of civs to try.",204.8
"great strategy game, takes a bit to get used to, but once used to the gameplay, very fun. high replayability and a great overall experience. 8.2/10",23.3
"lets be honest. who doesnt like destroying other countries and taking over the world? huh?",95.4
"simply brilliant! i think its much improved on civ iv, though many seem to disagree with me. improved a lot with the addition of brave new world - gods and kings was less impressive.",560.6
"one of the greats, and one of the few my wife will play.",68.3
"its 22hd of december 2013. this is a brilliant game.",209.4
"fun game with modding capabilities. a fun time all around.",96.6
"who doesnt want to rewrite history now and then? particularly if you paid a decent amount of attention in school to world history, there is a certain child-like glee in forcing katherine the great to surrender due to a total air, land and sea blockade by your elite, highly-advanced, nuclear-capable iroquois military (who still move faster in the woods).",44.0
"starting a game at midnight is definitely a poor choice. youll tell yourself that youre going to just save your game and pick it up in the morning. that wont happen.",33.6
"what an awesome game ! i wish i had a bigger harddrive so i can keep it for-ever in my computer ! unfortunatly, my 40gb bs hdd is not big enough. i could play this game forever and not get bored of it. i cant really make a proper review for you, about economical system, military system, social system etc. the only thing i can say: this game is near perfection. i think only tw: rome ii can be over it, altho i didnt play rome ii, its just a thought based on read reviews.",60.2
"each new evolution of civ is better than the last.. this is no exception.",698.2
"this game takes up all of my free time. 10/10 would recommend.",369.6
"fantastic game. be prepared to spend many many hours on a single round.",172.2
"buy it. you will not regret it. i have over 450 hours and i still play this game like the day i first got it",527.9
"sid meier does it again, great addition to the franchise and improves on the last.",639.0
"this is a great game for those who are newcomers to strategy games and those who are either familiar to civilization or strategy games in general. its simple and easy to understand but good enough as both an introduction and continuation to playing strategy games. i highly recommend it on its own but even more so if you buy the brave new world expansion.",542.5
"i find it hard to believe anyone is really reading reviews for this, as this is one of those games that i feel you either are already intimately familiar with, or want nothing to do with. that being said, if you are into strategy games and have never played this, i would advise you to get this the next time steam throws it on sale. if strategy is not your thing...dont.",141.3
"aside from getting nuked by gandhi and getting indoctrinated by the rambo enemy missionaries, this game is more than worth its money.if you dig strategy games and have plenty of time on your hands to build your own empire from scratch on a world stage, then this is for you. only real complaint are the prices on the dlc-s, but thats just my opinion. 9.5/10",249.8
"never played any civ game. tried today and dindt stop playing for 4 hours straight.the singleplayer its a very low pace game (at least i think it is), and i think thats great because it gives you time to learn the game. you should try it.",25.5
"this is the best strategic game that i ever played :) . and be carefull u can forget how is outside youre house .",20.9
"i would highly recomend this game to any person mainly. i have spent many hours playing with friends exploring the brave new world expansion including world congress and religion. me and my friends very much enjoy this expansionas it adds so many new features to the game. highly recomend. once bought just sign your life away. youll love it.",41.6
"great game with expansions and has so much re-playablity. i recomend being egypt for first play through.",53.4
"i would reccommend this game to the strategy gamers and those who have the patience enough to see their empire growing from humble beginnings to a mighty nation. its graphics are amazing and it has an addictive single & multi-player as well totally suitable for friends who intend to have some fun :) lead your nation to greatness!",58.6
"one of the best games in the civ series in my opinion. the game has an excellent combination of strategy, and action (for those who love wars that is.) i would reccomend this game to just about anyone who really wants to play a challenging game, and for those who love strategy, its a must have. with the steam community being extremely active in the work-shop, the game has an abundant amount of mods available to change the gameplay. i give the game a 10/10, and would highly suggest you to buy it, if you dont already own it. itll remain the the game of my choice for years to come.",381.6
"what can i say? its civilization. you come in for a turn, you stay for the night.",799.8
"civilization v is slowly taking my social life away but im fine with that, i got my friends to buy it so theres no need for me to leave the house anymore. i highly reccomend this game, its well worth it to buy the expansions.",190.6

"very fun, but not sure about the mechanics, and games take a very long time; which i guess is good :)",22.4
"they make it easy to mod the game with built in search tools to browse mods guess that is why i have 600+ hours logged in... 750 hours and counting and with the expansions it is like a whole new game",789.7
"if youre a civ fan and enjoy turn-based strategy, it really doesnt get any better than this! all the best parts of civ 1, 2 & 3 without the let downs of civ 4!",194.7
"even after all these years this game still holds up and is worth every peny.",30.2
"if you are a fan of risk or diplomacy or any of that kind of board game you will love civ. even those coming from the realms of aoe and cnc will like the relaxed but more strategic play style of a turn based strat like civ. only downside is its very long games, but if that dosent bother you, i suspect you might have found your new favourite game, if at least for a while.",87.2
"very very good, however i do have some crashes but overall this game is epic",39.4
"a great game a must have for any civ fan easy to play hard to master",89.1
"amazing love it especially with friends such a treat to play",85.1
"this game is dangerously addictive. i really dont want to recommend this game but i have had some great moments whilst playing it. the early game is really engrossing. mid game a bit of a muddle late game a bit of a chore. but you will find that you consume yourself and your time learning the mechanics of the game only to discover that you are ultimately micro managing several sets of numbers. (hammers, beakers, etc..) trying to increase them bit by bit. 169.3 hour on civ 5 and that is nothing compared to others. life it too short for a game like this.",207.6
"very good game if you want to pass time like youre doctor who, golden pass more than worth the extra money. this is one of those games that youll play for a week then stop then later on in the sycle youll start again. once again a very good game to pass the time with praticly no effert.",356.8
"playing the marathon length while tuning the rate of technology discoveries (slower obviously) gives you plenty of time to actually play in each era and makes the game even more fantastic",101.1
"awesome and engrossing game... you tend to take it personally when you get nuked by ghandi (and he started it)!!",488.6
"amazing game - hours of fun. great with friends and the modding community keeps content fresh.",60.7
"i installed the game one evening looking for a few hours of fun. i checked my phone at 3am only to realize it was actually 8am and the sun was peeking up over the horizon. oh god, what have i done?",64.2
"great replay value :d currently very cheap on humble bundle!! get it! thats all.",548.8
"this is probably the best strategy game ever. if you like strategy games, you should, no, you must buy this. its fun and very, very addicting.",212.4
"ive invested alot of time into this game worth it yes it has alot of different play styles and other civs especially on harder difficultys one of my top 5 games only thing i could put down about this is some of the starts are awfull and the crash bug i experience after around 80-85 turns of playing overall good :)",154.2
"8/10. great game that will suck the life out of you until you know everything about the roman empire. ai is wonky at times, but is almost always a fun experience.",276.5
"hands down on of the most effective turn-based games ive played in a long time. only downside is in large player matches...fighting against other people eats up a serious amount of time.",262.4
"this is by far one of my most favorite games ive ever played. every single game is vastly different with so many variables to account for that it makes it a very complex and stimulating game to play. with that being said it is also relatively easy to learn with the varied difficulty levels accomodating all levels of players. being able to see and learn about various things in world history while shaping your own version of it makes this game that much better. i cant wait to see what they do for civ 6.",741.4
"well wicked. got it on the cheap on humble bundle tho lol.",164.2
"awesome game for multiplayer and singleplayer though its really long its addicting.",20.1
"amazing turn base stategy game. with facts and wonders you probably did not know!! if you like a stategy game with historical info i reccomend it so get it yea",369.2
"this game can be summed up in one phrase: one more turn! so addictive that this one quote will be repeated so many times you wont even notice. awesome graphics, animations and soundtrack and one of the few games that not only welcomes but encourages the use of mods, adding massive amounts of gameplay to a game that already can give hundreds of hours of entertainment on its own.",307.7

"one of the more addicting games out there. you will find yourself thinking i will play until i reach the renaissance and hours later realize that you have tanks and that they were definitely not around during the renaissance. my main criticism is that for the game to really shine, it requires the purchasing one of the expansions in addition to the base game. the base game alone is a bit strategically bland compared to civ 4.",609.4

"civilization v is one of the very best strategic games on the market in terms of military activity, politics, culture, science, and economy. once you get attached to this game, itll provide hours and hours of fun and strategy. i recommend this game to any gamer who wants to build a nation, create alternate history, or simply conquer the world.",149.1
"have only played in local co-op and have enjoyed that, will probably make further comments as i play in sp. have satellite for internet so that does limit my games that i can play.",43.1
"epic, the dlcs turn the game into a brand new one..... as good if not better than civ 4",199.0
"a classic game model and one that sid meier is king, i felt this game returned a bit of the magic that was lost in iv not yet tried the multiplayer but looking forward to giving it a try soon. its another one of those games to keep you up until the early hours with that just one more turn mindset. i especially enjoy the fast paced early years in game over the modern era but its fun to just overpower your enemies end game",72.6

"even if you dont have any of the dlc, this game is fantastic. completely a great experience all the way through. normally, im not too into strategy, but this game sparked my interest. again, a truly fantastic experience. one bad thing though, in order to get the whole enjoyment out of the game, you need to put a lot of money, time, and effort into it. one minor blotch on a utterly fantastic game. [9.75/10]",104.5
"civ v is a more casual civ compared to the previous games in the series, however, it is still as addictive as ever and youll find yourself wondering where your day went every time you play.",116.7
"a joy to play like previous civ incarnations, and kept fresh with new ideas and possible strategies with a change to the unit-stacking rules, this is recommended whether youve played previous civilizations or not. some teething trouble at first that was soon patched enough times, i didnt really get into this version until the patches had come out, but i have to say it was worth the outlay. highly recommended like the previous games of the series if you like turn-based strategy games with more victory conditions than just kill everyone else (although eradicating all other players in the game will win too)",1097.3
"awsome game been playing since th 26 of december. good stradagy and war game.",97.8

"civilization v is a great in depth strategy game that combines elements of war, citybuilding and management of projects and resources to form a dense web of gameplay.there are around 40 civilizations each having a different playstyle to match with your personality and prefered victory.the steam community also embraces that civilization has a free mod kit available for download and they create many downloadable content packs to share with other players of civilization.there is a ton of fun to be had with civilization and i highly recomend it. :d",112.8

"the biggest time drain since taking a dump. youll pop in for a quick match then be playing the same match for the next 32 hours. during the time you will love and cry and finally achieve victory. you will stand victorious above all the nations you crushed on your way here and you will stop and think i could do this. then your political carreer begins. vote drtuv 2020",106.5

"frustrating fun! lol ive never finished a civ v game but ...well...i think ill end this review and start a new one, maybe ill get to the industrial era this time. also: i play pangea/huge/standard time/and usually prince..sometimes king for a challenge. the only thing i dont like is that to win one has to be sort of a war monger.",1092.7
"this game is one of the best games i have played in a long time.",465.8
"while not as good as the civ4 series the most recent patches released are getting it there. the hexagon tiles and one unit per tile seem to provide a better combat experience than that of civ4 but almost ever other victory conditions seems less so. i do recommend it based on its own merits alone. it is a fun game and if you like civ games you will like it civ5. however, if you are looking for another civ4 with better graphics this just isnt it ... yet. =)",675.2
"civilization v is one of the best turn-based strategy games out there. sid meiers epic game trilogy contines in this installment of civilization. with the new tile system and a newer type of strategy involved, it takes a true strategic master to complete games on some of the harder difficulties. this game is a must play for anyone who enjoys turn-based games of any kind.",565.1
"a turn-based game, so you can micro-manage your empire as it slowly takes over the world. there are tons of victory/map/civilization combinations, which makes achievement-hunting a blast! :)",124.9

"what are you doing reading this review, you should be buying civilization 5 and all of its game changing expansions! if you dont know what civilization is then you are sad on such a deep level. but, let me show you the light to lead you out of your ignorant ways. this game is the most beautiful piece of strategy than man kind has created so far. you take your group of loyal but hopelessly stupid and simple cavemen throughout the ages and eventually into the future were you drop nuclear warheads, barter for the fate of the world, and host the most splenderous wonders the world has seen in your civilization. see what i did there, i put the name of the game in the description. go ahead, buy it. if you feel that all this seems overly complicated or grandeous, then you are correct and if you turn away from the game because of that, then you are as simple as the cavemen described above.",353.8
"fun complete total world domination. a game to play with or without friends. it can be work some times, however, the reward of victory is very satisfying.",336.1
"fantastic visuals! such an easy game to just dive right into and just hit play now! easy to be good at, difficult to master. online play is an absolute train wreck however.",146.7
"spent nearly 600 hours playing this game, where did my life go? e_e",771.8
"a deep, wonderfully complex (but not everly so) tbs. many different ways to play, many variations of civs. the dlcs add so much more to the game play, they are well worth it to get. if you have the time to get into this, i would recommend it.",108.1
"the best civ game ever made :d if you get civ 5 make sure to get brave new world because it makes the game 1000x better.",44.6
"an great turned based strategy game, with many new things to the series, but still not everything that th eprevious games had. just make sure you keep track of time as you play one more turn for hours.",405.6
"as someone who is no fan of the other civ games, i went into this with no expectations for enjoyment. i was so wrong! great game and with gods and brave new world it is fully featured to make even the critics enjoy it. just one warning. do not start a game at night, you will not be going to bed if you do!",93.3
"great game. civ is one of the most addicting game with great replayablity potential. highly recommended",216.4

"so many strategies. so many turns. so much time. wow.",378.0
"this is the perfect time burner. it cost me days already. even though it is possible to save inbetween, i always get so sucked into the gameplay that i only suddenly realise its morning... the multiplayer is nice, tons of ways to build your empire, as always and a bunch of competition along the way to keep it interesting. can make you shout at your friends finish the round ******  ;)",176.9
"a fun fame that takes very long to finish 1 game and that really helps when bored. also the multi-player is fun but a little buggy. like the city trade bug. (when someone keeps modifing a offer they can get a city for free) but besides that the game is his price worth, and you wont become bored for a long time.",181.4
"great game. i love the hotseat-mode, wich is missing in most modern turn basend games.",359.4
"oh god ive spent too much time on this game. 11/10 would play again.",126.5
"so last night i went and tried the game out because ive had it for a bit. i started it at 2am ish and the next time i looked at the clock it was 4:30am! that hasnt happened in a while for me and a game. stratagey is gread! the tile and turn based systems work flawlessly. its overall a really great and addicting game",16.6
"fantastic strategy game, especially with freinds to play a game of politics, backstabbing and war among other things.",228.5
"never played any previous installments of civilization games. bought this when it was on sale and was hooked from the beginning. it has a bit of a steep learning curve when you first start out, but that didnt stop me from enjoying the game.",55.0
"you will spent a lot of time playing this game. one of the most entertain game i ever played. truly recommended",229.8
"epic fun, a classic must-have game! very relaxing.",331.0

"370 hours logged and still not bored of this game. its just such a masterpiece.",679.7
"this game will suck your life away. so many options for long term strategic play. many different playable civilizations with unique units, buildings and bonuses. one of the greatest games of all time.",377.6
"civilization 5 is one of the first strategy games ive ever gotten into, that being said it has hooked into the entire strategy genre. the tutorial alone kept me playing for several hours, and youll always want to keep playing until you produce that unit or research that technology. along with the addicting gameplay there are some pretty nice visuals and multiplayer is pretty damn fun. all in all i recommend this game at any price along with all the dlc.",45.4
"a fantastic 4x strategy game, especially with its expansions.",184.7
"addictive like you wouldt believe ! im affraid of booting this game and stay stuck in front of my computer all night when i have to go to work the next morning ! be sure to pick it up if you are remotely interested in strategy games ! 9/10",44.0

"loads of fun, but takes to much system resources for what it is.",115.2
"do not play this game if you dont want to waste hours at a time on a game. civ v is a fantastic and highly addictive game through and through. the gameplay is simple to understand but still challenging, and it is a lot of fun to play with a lot of friends. there is great mod content and plenty of dlc, all of which add on to the game really well. the only downside of this game is that it sucks away whole days of your life while you watch your empire be destroyed by ghandi. 10/10",150.1
"grand strategy of the finest ilk is reinvented once again. takes a bit of getting used to for veterans of the previous games, but once adjusted its just as deep and complex as the series name demands. two excellent expansions open up yet more options. **warning** - this game will eat your evenings & weekends with the series trademark one more turn compulsion",65.7
"you werent gonna do anything worth while for the next 8 hours anyways.",660.5
"bought this game, i dont have a life now -10/10 (sarcasm 10/10)",56.3
"possably the best turn-based-strategy series out there, and civilization v doesnt stray from the mark. whether you are returning to the series, or new to it #5 bring a lot to the table. there are a lot of leaders to choose to rule the land with, and even more if you use the steam workshop. many technologies, too many wonders to count, and above all, millions of ways that you can crush the opposition and conquer your map. this game also features a multiplayer and scenarios to test your skill. in all, great game a definate must buy.",43.2
"its a fun game and also a great time sink. would reccomend to anyone with alot of free time and nothing to do.",352.5
"the concept of one more turn is just a problem in my house. i say those words, with no meaning to them, that one more turn is always coming. never ending. great game",206.2
"potentially my favorite steam-enabled game of all time.",429.6
"this is a great update to a long running series. ive got the gods and kings upgrade and i like what the religion aspect adds. i got really pissed at gustavus adolphus for converting my capital, so i did it back to him!",357.1
"only get this game if youre willing ot risk looking up to see 8 hours have gone by and youve accomplished nothing important in your life.",210.2
"great game! immersive content, and very fulfilling. games last long sometimes, and are really fun if its a rainy day and you have nothing to do!",38.1
"good, but really undeveloped as far as strategy games go.",48.4
"loads of strategic fun. play with friends for some added competition!",71.2
"get used to saying to yourself one more turn then ill go to bed",92.5
"hey! do you have a life? nope! but i do have civ v! get this game, its not so much a video game though as an addiction, you will suffer from the one-more-turn disease for a very long time once you own this game. while it might be counter-productive to say this for a strategy game, this game really works only if you make hard tactical and strategic decisions, or you can play on easy mode, and play it leisurely. this game really allows any play style to flourish, and the multiplayer, although completely terrible at connecting to friends, is a complete blast. highly recommended 8.8/10",105.4
"if you like strategy games or just want to start playing strategy games civilization v is a great choice. with its turn based gameplay it is easy to get a feel for it after 1 or 2 games.this game also support multiplayer very well so you and a couple of buddies can either team up against bot or eachother. the gold edition is the way to go and if you enjoy the game at all, brave new world is a must it drastically improves almost every aspect of the game.",571.4
"addicting. i cant stop playing it,and i only started with venilla version.",18.3
"normally i cant stand grand strategies, but this game is just wonderful. great for fans of history and the humanities, and is an excellant excample of strategic thinking.",137.9
"reviews are subjective. civ is a slow paced, turn based strategy, if you like strategy and dont mind spending an evening playing a single game, then give the game a shot. civ does have some aspects that cater to players who prefer shorter games but realistically this is for those of us with high attention spans. i enjoy it and think it is a solid game, there are obviously things i dislike and negative aspects but again reviews tend to be too critical of utterly banal things so i will avoid that and just say i like it, if you have the money and you like strategy, try it out. if not, no huge loss :)",106.3
"i hate the fact that i spent $30 dollars on this game just to find out it is $12.49. but, the game is amazing and has a wonderful upgrading system. get it now before the deal is over and spend $30 dollars on it haha :d.",421.6
"this is the one game that any of my friends or i can rack up 100s of hours of gametime on and still be dying to play more. this is the epitome of the easy to learn, difficult to master mantra. the many different civs to choose from, multiple win conditions, and map generator mean that this game never quite plays out the same twice. the permutations are endless. definitely buy the expansions, as they add new units and mechanics that are fun, interesting, and well-balanced as well as fine-tune existing units and civs.",813.2
"can play this a thousand times and ways. awesome game.",320.7
"admittedly, it becomes same-y. admittedly, it becomes constrained after some time of your empire growing. and, admittedly, the ai isnt up to scratch. but the strategy that invades your purview on the higher settings sets you up for a realistic battle for conquerance. whether that be via war to win the world, victory in science, victory in diplomacy, victory in culture or standing the test of time, it does to great lengths introduce an abundance of components and options that really lack in some adversary total war titles (i know ill hold preference over this game from now on versus imperial glory: one of the games that got me into the pc platform in the first place). id recommend, especially more so as it grows on you as a pastime or interactive board game of sorts. but perhaps buy it in a steam sale, or whenever its on offer.",96.1
"i love you civ buts thats a whole lot of irrelevant decisions.",87.6
"crazy fun turn based strategy game. careful though. its addictive",164.0
"this game defines one more turn level of addiction",83.7
"recomended fully, also, each expansion is absolutely worth it ten times over.",138.0
"this is one of the most polished video games ive ever played. its the best of a great series.",397.0
"this game is simply amazing, and it has draind hours upon hours of my time and i truly love it. absolutely recommending this game :d",85.0
"if you have the time to invest, this game has the entertainment returns to give. build an empire, build an army, make friends and destroy your enemies. what feels like minutes with be hours building your world and make sure someone else doesnt rip it from you.",28.4
"great example of a turn-based strategy game at its finest. easy to begin and learn the basics, but at the same time difficult to master, civ 5 is a great game if you are the type that is interested in leading an empire. i highly recommend it.",340.0
"one of the best games out their, ive gotten almost every dlc out there available for it and it has not disapointed me, best money spent on any game ever, cant wait for the next expansion sid meier. keep up the amazing work! :)",266.5
"this is the best and most well developed with expansions out of any previous iteration of the game. this is absolutely one of my favorite turn based strategy games of all time. there are a wealth of things to do between nations, map size, settings, and achievements. this is a 100% must have for turn based fans, and a great starting point for anyone looking into the genre.",415.6
"a fun and creative game that is great for any fan of strategy games. its lack of realism is compensated for by its amazing gameplay.",105.0
"great game, worth every penny. it may seem complex but once you get the hang of it, it will become one of the best strategy games, in my opinion.",185.1
"the game is fun to play, although games do take a while to complete. better if played over a couple days or even weeks rather than all at once.",204.5
"this game is one of the most fun games i have ever played in my entire life and its even more fun with friends. i absolutly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a fun game. also it gets even better when you get the dlc.",9.7
"best 13 dollars ive ever spent buy the expansions though",110.0
"my all-time favorite franchise. i never get bored with this game. this is my fall back game with i dont feel like playing anything else. this is a must have game for any serious gamer.",572.3
"very good, but does tend to slow down on huge maps.",799.3
"awesome game, great turnbased combat. love the different victories and variety of civs and leaders you can play. great time sink, which is to say that this game will take hours to get through one playthrough. but you can save and whatnot so why not? yall just gotta go rambo style and play mongolia ya dig?",122.7
"great game! needs some work with online play, but other then that pretty good. best strategy game out there",238.1
"trust me when i say that this game will make you play until its 2 am, its that fun. if you want to play a turn-based-stratigic game that grows in time when you play it longer, this game is for you! if you want to play as a japanese warlord, this game is for you! if you want to destroy all nations in your way wihtout feeling guilty about it, this game is for you! (also it has giant robots of death. dont belive me? play the game and youll see.)",48.0
"i really wouldnt suggest buying any of these games, theres no real room for dipolomacy or anything and the ai will freak out at the slightest hint of something they dont like. although the brave new world expansion fixes a  ton of the issues. so, yeah....kinda worth it now.",253.1
"dont get this game. hours, literal hours will fly by before youve noticed. i dont even know if this game is fun - all i know is that half of my day dissapeared and i wasnt aware of time passing. there is something sinister about this game..",35.2
"this game is amazing. when i first bought it, i played for 12 hours straight, crushing all enemies in my path. it has fantastic multiplayer. my only negative is that the games expansion packs are more expensive than they should be.",200.7
"this game makes me too paranoid to function. i love it.",126.9
"bought this game back in 2012. almost three years later and i still love playing this game. i dont think ive put more time in any other game, and ive been gaming since i was a kid. phenomenal depth, easy to learn, theres not much to hate about this game. however, if you do buy it, make sure you buy the expansion packs, gods & kings and brave new world, they make the game so much better than its original version. and the original was pretty good to begin with,",390.6
"if you love empire-building games and turn-based combat games, youll love this game. its an all-around improvement on the previous civ games, and they seem to get better with every new version of the series. the only thing i dont like about civ v is that i cant combine my troops into an army (which was a feature in a previous installment of the franchise). i hope the next version offers the option again.",40.7
"one of the most fun games i have played in a long time, but be warned! you will get hooked like an addict on gaming crack, and there are so many mods that enhance the game, even when you feel like youre done with the standard campaign (and thats without even mentioning the awesome multiplayer) :d would definitely recommend! 10/10",242.0
"so addictive (40 hrs in 5 days?!?!?), yet it lets you set your own pace because its turn-based strategy. i prefer this to rts games like aoe 3.",94.6
"started to play thinking, well i got them all pretty much in that humble bundle, might as well try it a bit, ive heard some good things about it. 7 hours later it crashes and i look at how long i played and after 7 hours of utter immersion and amazing fun. defenitely one of the best games ive played thats been developed within the last year or so.",43.2
"want time to suddenly fly out of your grasp? looking for a game that will suck away your soul? this is the game for you! (seriously, i lose my life ten hours at a time. this is both awesome and horrifying. buy now.)",470.7
"this game is fun with expansions and well made but very poorly programmed, the multiplayer online barely works for anyone yet they do nothing to fix it, the game crashes often for everyone i know and has not improved that since its launch, and for many i know it will take anywhere from a minute and a half to even ten minute to even launch, often for many it will not launch at all yet the game still costs a good deal of money and does nothing to fix these problems. please go find another game, even the previous civ ran far better than this, this game is not worth your money, there are plenty of better options.",23.4
"played against germany 1v1 seperate continents everytime they tried to make a city on my continent i conquered it and they gave me one of their cities on their continent best ai 10/10",47.9
"anybody who likes 4x games, turn based strategy games or micro-management should get this.",820.4
"if you liked the civ series, youre going to love this. pair it with brave new world and it will be even better. enjoy winning a campaign by playing like a dalek to get the exterminate! exterminate! achievement, by playing like a politician to win the diplomatic victory (meh), by playing like a pop artist to win a cultural victory, or by playing like my brother to default into (attempting to) winning by points at year 2050.",77.2
"its not as good as iv. kind of thats it really. no permanent alliances feature, a much more gamey game, made very much for a multiplayer experience or a very gotta beat it experience. civ iv was much more of a simulator of the birth of a civilization. win or lose i enjoyed it because it went through the stages not realistically but logically of a civilizations rise, and potential and almost inevitable fall. civ v is a game about how to best beat the systems it has put in place to challenge you. there is an entire meta around starting location. thats not what i go to a civ game for. if it is for you, great, but it isnt the game i wanted nor desire out of this franchise.",23.5
"in my current game against bots, i am king of arabia, who conquered all of south america by defeating england in 300bc, i then explored until i found africa where i allied myself with china and waged war against germany, greece and the ottoman empire, which was laughably one-sided because i, arabia, am the wealthiest/most powerful/most cultured/most technologically advanced society in the world. i am also taking over earth. its an amazing game, if you love strategy games, an easy 9/10, if you dont usually play strategy games much, its still a definite 8/10. you should really play it, yes im talking to you. you. you should play this. not john, not bob, not saint mary mcloius jeebus, but you.",57.0
"a lot of improvements since civ iv. religion shouldve been in the vanilla game, but theres not really that many problems. definitely worth buying, as long as you have a lot of time on your hands because civ is very addicting and games can take a long time to finsih on some settings.",92.4
"fantastic game, very addictive, but will suck every minute out of an entire day if you dont watch the clock",92.6
"a very elaborate stratgy game with dynamic features. civilization 5 is a great game to play alone or with friends!",155.9
"when a wild civilization game appeared its effect on me was super-effectve!",38.7
"very well done, especially with the expansions. many different ways of winning, leaving the option for warmongering, teching, etc.",126.6
"i was a bit skeptical to jump into something thats notably complex. however, the interface, tips and tutorials as you play are great assests and make the transition much easier than expected. im now a huge fan of the game and purchased the expansions days after completing the purchase for the standard version. dont be intimidated. trust me!",168.9
"a great game for the greatest of gamers. where people help or do war against each other, or have the nations do diplomacy and trade. whether or not you like war or peace or safety or danger this is a great game.",327.9

"wow. such strategy. much addicting. very size. wow.",113.3
"this is one of the most amazing turned based strategy games ive evr played, althought the multiplayer disappointed me a little bit its still definitly worth the buy!",256.4
"a lot of thinking and hard descisions. each expansion makes the game harder yet more fun! tons of strategy and allways different playthrough then that last time!",182.4
"it is a great statergy game, i would recommed to anyone who like to just sit down and play a game as i have played for 6 hours in a row before, in his also good on multiplayer as you can compete with your friends to win the title of great startergy master and overall ruler, i really enjoyed and i hope anyone else who get it does enjoy it to.",102.5
"played about 100 hours 0 dlc what are you doing if you dont have this game?",150.0
"if you havent played civilization before, you might as well just buy it. its an essential part of the history of computer games, and you should play at least one version of it. if you have played civ before, civ v is more of the same. its got more nations, more modes of victory, and more pixels. its good. the biggest change is that in civ v, you cant stack more than one military unit on a square. (actually, a hex. thats also a change.) this, i think, is sort of a downer. it definitely changes how combat feels, but it can be more annoying than it should be, especially because it doesnt work well with path-finding. on the other hand, cities can attack enemies a few hexes away, which is a big deal. it was worth the $15 i paid for civ v plus its two big dlcs, and i enjoyed the 40 hours i sank into it. im not sure it wouldve been worth the upgrade from civ iii or civ iv. its pretty, though!",35.3
"very adicting once you get into it. i had fun playing it. gahndi is a jerk also",114.7
"civilization v is awesome, and with the brave new world dlc it becomes epic <3",84.8
"no such thing as a quick game. you have been warned",146.7
"if you have the patience to build an empire from the ground up, then you will enjoy this game. highly addictive with multiple intriguing ways to win. strategy is needed and having a few friends play with you is an absolute blast. however, the two main expansions (gods & kings / brave new world) are a must-have. the game would feel incomplete without them because they really do add a lot.",178.8
"it is a great game to play with friends and family or even by yourself, enjoy!",97.1
"spectacular game. a blast to play with friends online.",75.8
"another civilization, another masterpiece. still the best game in terms of turn-based strategy.",55.4
"civilization 5 is the ultimate strategy game. 10/10!",1029.0
"sid meier has made another masterpiece! this is a great game! say goodbye to productivity if you buy this game!",14.6
"i love this game a lot. it not only makes you think about your military but also your economy. i love playing as the japanese and russians.",68.6
"as a hardcore strategy gamer who is no stranger to planning out my empires production dozens of turns in advance, ive already turned to civ v for my world-conquering needs  but at the same time, if anything is going to rear a new generation of strategy gamers like the very first civilization did for me, its this. finally, civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",142.5
"this game is well worth a play for any sort of stratergy gamer at any level. weather you prefer war or peace this game is for you! the easy to play style with diferent ways to win means every game is different. with diferent faction units bulidings and effects you can enjoy playing diferent leaders (my faverouts are russia and japan). anyway i hope you buy this game and enjoy this. if you have this game feel free to add me for a multiplayer game.",82.3
"my friends and i play this for hours on end. say goodbye to your social life. forever.",140.6
"whilst this is simpler than civ 4 (especially with all the beyonf the sword expansion) it is more enjoyable to play and retains the depth",350.6
"if this game was a penguin, it would be a pretty good penguin.",225.5
"kind of like the monopoly of the pc games. except you dont kill your friends or family for buying a property.",165.7
"i have played civilization since it was first released, the latest version has got to be the ultimate in strategy gaming. it is easy to get lost in this game, where you control most every aspect of creating your own unique civilization from the ground up! definately a casual game, yet with complexities that can and will rob you of endless hours!",149.6
"a fun game that is recommended to people that like building crap",5.3
"this game is great if you like strategy games, aswell as turn-based games and real-life scenarios. if you are a history geek like i am, you will absolutely love this game!",31.0
"a very good game if you have a lot of free time and want to play with friends",12.3
"have you ever thought why your parents, friends and even people who pass you in the street hate you. its because you dont own this game. it can be as satisfying as using sandpaper to pleasure yourself and after 50 hours it seems to lack depth. but yeah good clean christian fun.",84.8
"it is a good game. until it crashes!! this is inevitable. you literally cannot finish the game. do not waste a penny on this.",143.6
"you can play hours of this game in one go without wanting to leave! it is an amazing mouse only game you you can sit in your chair and not have to worry about any typing! get it naow!!!",29.3
"this is the best civ game since civ ii. combat has finally been made really strategic, with flanking bonuses, units not fighting to the death, and intrinsic city garrisons. if you like turn based empire building, you need to pick this one up.",314.3
"this game, this game. unbelievably addictive and thorough. play this game.",97.8
"indeed a great game. i wish so hard they fix soon the multiplayer performance, cause it is a delight to play with friends.",137.6
"this game has been one of the most enthusiastic and addictive games i have ever played and i recommend this game to anyone even if you dont like strategy games in general you should get it; overall i give 10/10; one of the best games ever made...",349.1
"this is an amazing game, would recommend it to anyone.",247.8
"great game. very addicting. not sure what all the complaining is about, i love the streamlined ui and hex tile system.",38.1
"got several copies for me and friends. great stradegy game, not if youre short on time though....",50.0
"this game is something special, you control civilizations and make choices for their paths and strategies to fight and destory other civilizations. would advise anyone who loves to make their descisions, strategies and ways of playing a game to buy this right now.",95.1
"one of the best games ever. very complex and elaborated, as civ always was. various settings, random maps, scenarios and expansions round it up to have no game like the other. quite a lot workshop mods and dlcs let you modify even more aspects so it wont get boring. it even teaches you some real history while you write your own. only bad thing is that it needs a lot of time to calculate next round if you have a lot of opponents, depending on your hardware. must-have if you like strategy games.",409.5
"ill be honest, i was pretty skeptical of this game when i first bought it. id been playing civ games since i was a kid, and the switch from square to hex grid was kinda weird, and gave it more of a board game feel. still, the game forces you to think more tactically than its predecessors did, because you cannot stack units like you used to be able to. on its own, the base game is fairly weak, but if you get either of the expansions, it definitely jumps to the front of the line in the civilization series. the online multiplayer is incredibly depressing, however, so take that into account.",616.6
"if you like strategy and board games then this is for you. outstanding title.",61.7
"awesome strategy game that is great for the pros and the beginners.",28.0
"i absolutly love this game, it can be ruthless and tough the first time if your new to the series. but that will make the game all the more fun. i have put 5 hours in and it felt like 30 mins, so needless to say that this game is addicting. just dont trust ghandi...",12.6
"awesome game, very deep and satisfying! it was worth every penny! very fun to play with friends and alone, but kinda lacks the giant freaking huge maps that the previous games had, in my opinion. but that might just be my brain playing tricks on my! anyway, totally worth it! buy it!!",57.3
"its really strange that this game and civ iv are such different titles. the fundamentals are all there, but itll be a bit of a learning process comming to civ v over from civ iv. its still just as addicted as iv, but the aforementioned is something to keep in mind.",2.1
"a good game alone, even better with a few friends. only wish we could have mods in the multiplayer.",220.8
"a great strategy game. its different enough from age of empires to make it a unique and refreshing take on this style of game. youll wonder where the hours went after playing a session of this. there are multiple ways to win and hundreds of moves to be made. if you fire up a game today, dont expect to get anything else done until tomorrow.",32.5
"quite frankly, few attributes of games ellicit such anger and discontent as those found rampantly within the broken and consistently inconsistent formula that constitutes this game, civilization v. other games offer more refined methods, with more visually and mechanically sophisticated gameplay options than can ever be conceived of within this joke of a strategy game.",72.0
"great game! so fun being able to win without firing a single shot but also to have the option to nuke cities if i want :)",183.7
"possibly the best turn based strategy game ever released",303.5
"its basically like mixing peaches and apples. 10/10 would write review again.",240.5
"this game is unbe.lieveable. if you like stratagy, well it just never ends... and i mean that literally, i dare you to sit down with friends and finish one game.... i dare you",379.0
"hmm, only a 5/10 from me, im afraid ... id dearly like to recommend this but there are still (after 3 years) outstanding bugs, freezes, lock-ups & crashes that detract from overall gameplay & enjoyment, paricularly with larger maps that have more going on. buy it if you must (& then only when steam have a sale on) but be warned",113.0
"only is this game i will say to myself thank god ghandi is dead 10/10",53.7
"incredibly addictive yet peaceful. you sit down to play and then suddenly it is four hours later.",478.6
"i thought i wouldent like this but a few friends convinced me and omg its amazing. even single player is so much fun that i completly recomend it especially at 7.50$ at that price its a steal",157.3
"very entertaining and lots of food fun with strategy. fun multiplayer",292.4
"this game is awesome, i highly recomend getting it.",63.4
"this one time barbarians took my settler the very first round so i lost instantly........its very fun.",145.9
"a great way to kick back, relax, and have lots of random discussions with your friends.",127.2
"great strategy game that lets you sit back and think about the moves. very in-depth with lots of intricate processes such as faith, happiness and food. there is a wide variety of ways to win for each save game, withn random maps that will provide a collection of resources that will help you on the way. although every civ (ie. english) have different advantages and a couple of unique units, it isnt impossible to stray off their advantage on lower difficulties. this allows you to really explore and get a handle on any win type using any civ.",76.8
"this game game is the virtual military version of monopoly it consumes lives and time and will destroy freindship, still a great game though.",19.4
"very addicting, fun, makes you think, worth every penny.",33.9
"the best strategy game i have played in my life. it puts its predecesor games to shame as well as making the game as close to reality as possible. adding many exciting aspects that i am sure all respectable gamers can enjoy.",337.3
"do have friends? then the best use for them would be to play this game with them. the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is engrossing, and the concept holds it own. you really should pick it up and become a master of civilization!",373.4
"civilization 5 is one of my favorite games! not only is it extremely interesting what will happen the next turn, but it even keeps you wondering the next day! it is very addicting, has many nations to choose from, and has a very uplifting soundtrack. however, the price is a bit high, and i suggest you wait until a sale for the game comes out (for example, $7.49 instead of $29.99). overall, you should definitely purchase this game.",30.6
"amazing game that will definitely make the hours fly by.",427.5
"this game is probably the best strategy game i have ever played. its extremely fun with friends, and its not too difficult to understand while still being somewhat complex. i think it deserves its metascore rating of 90. however, it crashes on me frequently. so frequently that i may have to reload 20-30 times in order to play a single game. after researching this problem, its apparently common in the steam version.",54.8
"this game is pretty rad, but only comparable to civ4bts with all the expansions. best wait for a sale on the whole package beore picking up, kek",6.3
"holy ing  this is one of the best ing games ive ever played in my entire ing life.",78.5
"history, a. learn you some past and get to beat some historical . also,  gandhi that a attacked me unprovoked.",91.5
"absolutely amazing, especially with all of the dlc. perfect for those with a political mind, or a personality that longs for power.",239.6
"with almost 300 hours logged and gifting copies to most of my friends, i can justly say my opion is very high of this game. its beyond addictive and so entertaining. you truly get lost in this game and the hours seem to disapear. so beware.",464.8
"fantastic game. offers hours of game play and makes time fly by.",45.0
"nuking my best friends when they are 3 ages below me its a feeling like your a god.",89.5
"what can i say... its civ - of course its good! initially though i did find it a little more frustrating than civ iv in that every single ai opponent wants to go to war with you - even ghandi!, but they can be relatively easily kept at bay on all but the highest difficulty levels if you are leading the tech race and have a full kitty (and if you dont have either of those - youre not doing it right ;p). overall, an interesting and fairly replayable addition to an already great series.",34.5
"this is a great game, nuff said. there are hours of fun awaiting you if you pick this up. not for the faint of heart.",957.9
"im probably going to have to uninstall this game. ive never been a strategy game player. but civ 5....i cant get off it. the game is great. with so much to do and so many ways to win, i cant imagine getting bored with this anytime soon.",78.9
"possibly the best entry in this genre defining franchise. i would absolutely love to see alpha centauri delivered using this engine.",124.9
"civ v is the turn-based strategy game for the ages. soon after playing for the first time, youll be glued to this game for hours upon hours, and youll love it. great for anyone who loves them a good strategy game, or for anyone with a passing interest in them. the astounding variety in civilizations and game possibilities, as well as multiplayer make this game worth every penny and gold piece. hex grid master race.",165.3
"we are anonymous. civ v is a great game. if you have not played any civ game, you have not yet lived.",26.5
"the best if its genre by a mile and a half. highly recommended if you like your strategy games with a friendly learning curve, but still with that intricacy that can take a long time to master. (has an in built user friendly modding system in the main menu)",80.8
"just amazing, turn based, think ahead strategy game. when on sale, its really worth your money.",161.2
"very good game, great multiplayer, thought it would be boring, boy was i wrong, great change of pace with no hiccups,",7.6
"my god is this game a beauty. i honestly have no explanation for how good it is other than nukes. exploration. conquest. 10/10",39.7
"such an addicting game. i honestly lose track of time when i play civ and i end up playing for hours. such an in depth and immersive world there really arent words to describe it. strongly recommend to anyone who plays rts games. one quick hint though . . . never trust france. ever.",206.4
"great game with a lot of content and diverse strategies. great for playing with friends. it is very time consuming.",563.2
"this is one of the greatest games for pc. i highly recomend it, however civ 5 and the brave new world (bnw) dlc are even better.",419.7
"amazingly detailed and superbly balanced rts game that sees you take one of the many historic civilizations of the worlds history to full dominence of the whole world, through all past present and future time periods.",189.2
"this game is too addicting and i love it. set a timer when playing or youll keep saying one more turn and play til 1:30 in the morning. highly recommended though!",109.4
"i remember ol days when i played civ 1 & 2.. now im spending my hours playing with this marvelous piece of art. 9/10 stuff!",70.8
"now that the expansions are out it is as good as civ4!",291.4
"great game few things can be fixed like the trading ai with other civs.",284.1
"still the greatest time sink you will find on steam.",158.9
"what a fantastic standout from this newist addition to the best strategy franchise in history. so many things to do. it is also the most replayable game i have played.",573.9
"this game is beautiful. does it really need another recomendation? im sure youve heard of it or seen gameplay. one of hte absolute best turn-based stratgey game. p.s. if you get the gods and kings expansion, be prepared to look at an ugly pubic haired jesus wanna-be staring off into the sunset wandering where his life went wrong every time you start the game up... freaking hated seeing his face.",129.3
"what a great game so far... i havent really played it multi yet, but single, online or off, is fun! i recommend this game to all my friends!",41.8
"great game to play alone or with friends, but be warned games can take forever to complete",421.7
"fun game... but warning it eats up time by the day!",136.8
"a game where ghandi will nuke all your cities 10/10",7.6
"this version of civilization is pale in comparison to its predecessor when it comes to depth an complexity, and i dislike it for that fact. however civilization 5 is one of my most played games. civ 5 is part of the new accessible breed of sequels, designed to bring a known franchise down to the knuckle-dragging level of complexity so xbox kids and fratboys dont feel like total dip when trying to master the intricacies of the lowest difficulty. it is simple, it is fun, you really only need to know one or two tricks to win on any map at any difficulty, and then thats it, you get to master civ 5 and brag to all your friends about it. its fun, simple, different, and more akin to a board game than previous civ iterations.",345.4
"this game can drag you out for hours and make you say hey, just one more turn then ill get off. but nope, that nation just provoked you and now youre going to kick their . this game is a classic and is truly fun. dont underestimate it.",16.5
"another civilization game and another stroke of genius. this game allowed for a personal approach to civilization development based on my own preference rather than providing a single formula for success. this is a great turn-based game and i strongly reccoment it.",53.2
"very good rts but the matches could take a day no lie.",46.8
"best game ever but i think more civilizations are needed",351.9
"fantastic gamestyle. ive played civ ii, but this is just incredible! i highly recommend!",85.0
"words can not express how much you can not trust ghandi when he gets his first nuke. this game is crazy addictive, i advise people to play at thier own risk. stuff will not get done around the house when played, it doesnt matter if its turn base youll wind up saying to yourself ....just one more turn then ill get off...",305.7
"great strategy game, takes a little getting used to but definitely worth the time to play.",30.3
"played for over 8 hours straight and didnt finish one game",22.0
"just one more turn, youll be thinking this alot when playing civ 5 fantastic!",101.0
"a fun game!! but it is a black hole for your time... ()",20.7
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played in my life. i put more than 150 hours into this game and the only other game i put more than one hundred hours into is skyrim, and thats sayig something about this game. this game is easily around a 9/10 or 8/10 you will be so addicted",325.6
"imo they have changed the game mechanics to much and at times (although a good game) it feels like it shouldnt even be called civilization, if you love the game mechanics that civilization has been famous for and grown on from the 1st game play civilization 4 not this one. civilization 5 is a good game but its not civilization as should be!",23.0
"in the 100+ hours ive thrown into this game, i can easily say that civ 5 is one of the most addicting strategy games ive ever played. its the turn-based aspect about it that hooks me, i think; i need to just finish this next turn and that turns into 100 or so. ive not been able to delve into absolutely everything yet, all the map types and civs would take probably months of play, or a few nights on a wiki. if youre into a good strategy game and you dont mind putting a lot of time into a match, its good fun.",114.4
"great game if your into strategy not as great as civ 4 but still great game",554.0
"the only game you can play for hours and make 0 progress.",262.7

"honeslty, with all the expansions, who wouldnt own this game?",255.3
"this game has destroyed my social life and caused my friends to alienate me. 10/10",175.4
"this game is great for people who keep a busy schedule. it is turn based and you can easily play this for 5 minutes a day, everyday, for a lifetime. (seriously, it will take a lifetime)",149.9
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played. its charming, witty, funny, and plays very smoothly, with very few bugs. the ai is intelligent, the maps excellent, and the game suceeds where so many others havefailed to captivate me.",196.1
"civ v is a fun game, but be sure not to take anything the wrong way. this game tends to ruin friendships. xd",41.2
"reminds me of the total war series. but better. without the rts aspect.",253.1
"i love this game! its so great. it is both entertaining and strategic. ive played 60 hours so far and i could easily play 60 more!",138.0
"civilization 5 is a very good game, the only thing missing from civ 4 is religion. the graphics are worlds better, it is very smooth, and my only complaint would be the time it takes to process ai movement with a large number of ai.",6.6

"a wonderful game, but takes some time to play and is addicting.",374.1
"when i first got the game i thought i would not like it but after playing it i changed my mind. there is a lot of differant types of win you could go for & there is a lot of choice for the maps this games is fun even if you are not playing with friends. there is a lot of startegy to the game & everything depends on your happyness & luxary resources to trade either to make more money or improve relations with other civs",69.8
"though i was new to the civilization series this game did a very good job at teaching me how to play. this game is a must have to all tbs strategy fans. its fun, good, and not that complicated but still complex.",280.1
"this is one of the best games that i have ever played. most of the time when people play games they get really bored after playing it for a while, with civilization v you get a lot of replayabillity and endless descisions which make it really fun to play over and over again. one good bonus to this game is that, if you choose to, it provides a lot of historic value in it telling what certain heros, millitary units, and even time frames did, why they were important, and how they shaped the world today. the game provides quotes after each technology is reserched which provides interesting, motivational, and even funny parts in the game. i 100% reccommend this game to anyone. although i am a little disappointed that i paid $15 about a week ago for it and it just went on sale for $7.50. even with that being stated i would buy this game even if it was $30.",356.5
"you will never remember how good this game is, sitting in your library for months unloved, then you get bored, open it, and boom 6 hours just dissapeared. use with caution.",191.8

"great game, but even better with the brave new world or gods and kings expansion packs. i highly recommend this for anyone. very easy to learn too, and has mod support!",66.9
"a fantastically polished example of the turn-based strategy genre. it evokes a similar feeling to the call to power spin-offs, which i like a lot. its also a very addictive game: if minecraft has gamers saying just one more block for hours on end, then the equivalent civ 5 addict would utter just one more turn again and again. all in all, if you like turn-based strategy, theres little here to dislike. just be wary of gandhis nuclear strike program.",431.4

"one of the finest strategy games around! the replay value is huge and each game can suck many hours out of you life. theres this just one more turn virus which is unique to the series, this game has it too. there are many different civiliztions to choose from and the game is very flexible, by that it is both friendly to new players while still offering challenge to veterans. theres a huge modding community for this game which makes the game even better. if you bring a friend or two, you wont feel how time flies as you play, the multiplayer is also great and there are many people playing it. overall, if you are a strategy fan, this is a must buy!",454.0
"+addicting gameplay +good isometric graphics (animations/art) +value purchase (spend alot of time playing) -later stages become boring and tedious as you manage your civ -limited variety among civs -not necessarily better than previous game in series you build a civilization from scratch as you diplomaticly, forcefully, or scientifically dominate and eventually win the game. there is alot more appeal at the beginning of the game as creating your first cities and fighting off bandits is more fun than slowly adding more buildings that mean nothing to you later on in the game or slowly eliminating and annexing you opponents cities. for experienced civ players, it is a more brief and slighly dumbed down experience that is made more enjoyable in the process (depending on how agonizing you thought the previous games could get). [get at sale]",75.2
"a series of games that fills a niche market but, does it so well that i feel compelled to buy every new release. civ v is no different and despite having some early woes from incompatability issues (since have been fixed) you have game that is one of the most time consuming, all encompassing, and cognative to be released. at least until civ vi that is.",27.3
"while the expansions have definitely helped, the latest installment of civ isnt quite as intricate as earlier versions. the ai seems to have suffered between games, and several features of the series have been changed for better or worse. that being said, ive sunk a lot of time into it. if turn based strategy is your thing, its a good time. pick up the gold edition, and then if that grabs your attention, upgrade to bnw. dont trust montezuma. ever.",172.2

"a classic. any game where you can say to yourself just one more turn and when you next look at a clock you find that 3 hours have passed has got to be a good one!",38.7

"really really amazing game love it!!!! love it!! love it!!!",425.0
"as a huge civ 4 fan, i recommend sid meiers civilization v if you want to take this franchise to the next level. the graphics are far more beautiful, the soundtrack more inspiring and certain game elements, such as hex-based grid, let you strategize in new fulfilling ways. i also like that the leaders are voiced in their native languages, what i dont like is how time-consuming this game can be. seriously, civ 5 has the power to keep you enthralled for hours on end. it really is that good. one other thing, low-end machines can run the game in direct x 9, which is great if you dont have a powerful monster at your side :)",20.0

"wasted many, many hours playing this. expanision packs are well done and worth the money. great buy at the cost.",766.3
"civilization v is the latest iteration of uncle sids brainchild, and to say the least the direction in which the developers took with this one has me torn. the new combat system (switching from squares to hexes, no unit stacks) is addictive, but reduces the scope and scale of the game by such a margin that your mighty empires dont appear to be as grandiouse as they were in the previous installments. however, the visuals are top notch, the new social policy system is incredible, and its first expansion gods & kings brings back what everyone missed from civ iv (religions and espionage.) all in all, it isnt my favorite civilization game, but civ v is most definately worth purchasing and putting ungodly amount of hours into.",493.6
"return to the inventive mind of sid meiers civilization franchise with renewed civilizations. each leader provides, not only unique units and/or structures, but specific civilization-wide powers. from oda nobunagas power to fight to the end at full strength, to ramesses ii and his wonder building bonus. each leader has unique audio when interacting with them, in their peoples language. this holds true if youre speaking to japan, france, egypt, mongolia, and even aztec and iroquois! if you want to imerse yourself in the cultures of the strategy game series that made the perfect turn-based formula, or just want to prove a civs superiority over all the rest, take up your sword and diplomatic skills for the first time in this generation!",375.7
"its like civilization iv, except it has a v instead of an iv. there are a few other changes as well...",400.5

"great system, well organised. more ideal for multiplayer usage, and more fun with closer friends than strangers. make sure you have a lot of time to invest, or you will be taking a lot of breaks and games can go on for weeks, maybe months. highly advise to get the dlcs that improve gaming content, and are extensions, as they tend to include importany and game defining features. 9/10 recommended for those who have friends willing to take the time to play a city building game.

"my god civ v is such an addicting experience. while it might not be the perfect grand-strategy experience, it certainly achieves what it tries to do. like every civilization game, its played best with expansions, and both brave new world and gods & kings are wonderful addons that really add to the experience in great way, the world congress is a perfect addition to the game, and that is just one of many features that these expansions succeed with. i dont really know what makes civ so addicting, its just so varied and you can either play as a warmonger or a peacekeeper, its up to you. this is one of my favorite games ever and ive had so much fun with it, as i will continue to have. if you like turn-based strategy, this game is a must.",427.4
"this is the civ game with the lowest barrier to entry. the tutorials are nice, the pop-ups informative, and the gameplay very addicting. if youve even thought about playing one of these games, give this a whirl and thank me when 8 hours go by without you knowing. ;)",26.9

"no, i would never recommend this game to anyone. my problem is not with the game, the game is excellent, brilliant. the problem is steam. you have the worst customer support of any company i have ever dealt with. ever. i would not subject anyone i know to your arrogance, refusal to interact with a live person, and continuing problems with the simple concept of downloading a game i already own!",1048.8

"easy to grasp yet complex game. fraxis games keeps showing us that they are the very best developers of turn-based strategy games. last expansion (brave new world) gave the game kick in needed. this game will surely be one of the best or even the best strategy game of this decade. and that place would be well earned.",91.0

"to try and keep this brief, civilization five in one of the most refined strategy games on the market. the fact that even recently the game is still recieving both offical expansions, and user content should be a testament to that alone. building on the framework of pervious titles, and reworking nearly every aspect into a more streamlined approach might have back fired. yet, it still remains addicting and fun even after the years it has been released.",241.2

"this is a very fun and addicting game! some things can be unlikable, like the hexagons, but you can disable that. all in all, this is totally worth it. reserve at least 5 hours at a time when you play; theres no such thing as one more turn.",51.3
"fun strategic game but takes too dang long to complete a single civlization/game.",2.1
"this game is brilliant if you like strategy games, however it is not for everyone. there is one problem, its addictive. if you get a chance play the demo or if a friend has it ask to play as it is much better to play than watch.",303.7

"really additcting game, spent multiple hours taking over the world through dominitating and destroying with robots and nukes and also through winning the space race. their are multiple ways to win a campaign and that just makes it even better. civ 5 is a must buy for strategy lovers!",121.7

"just one more turn... i need... to... get one... more turn! now!",13.1
"amazing game. vastly interesting as it has countless scenarios (not to be confused with the game mode scenearios) in which you must strategically lift your civilization above all others. great strategy game, and in my opinion, doesnt get boring. even better with a friend or two.",468.7

"too few civs and too many useless civ bonuses (celts? really?), but other than that, its pretty solid. a lot of people  about the combat, but being a fan of civ iv, all i can say is that its infinitely better now than it was. there are some regressions, but there are a lot more improvements to balance out the little bit of back-sliding. once again, i cant really recommend it at full price unless you plan to play it really seriously. its a goty, so its absolutely going to be on sale eventually. just be patient and pick it up with the gods & kings expansion (which is sadly an evil necessity.)",170.3

"i am addicted to this game and love playing it. the combat is turn based but i love it anyway and i cant get over the city building idea. i enjoy the easy setup for multi-player and play regularly. the race for the wonder is amazing when all your friends are rushing the same wonder and well all finish at the same time, but wait he just got more production points hes going to win. this game is for all ages above 10 and is always great for multi-person games. i recomend to all civ building fans out there and even if you are not one yet. pass on the recomendations to your friends and families! have fun ;) i would rate this ****** (6) stars",124.5
"a great time killer with so much to do and so many valve supported mods to add to the fun!",194.1
"this game will devour your time like a greedy child hovering over a cookie jar. when played in conjuction with gods + kings and brave new world this title is everything i love in a turn based strategy; addictive, fun, complicated and fun in single or multiplayer. it improves on many aspects of the previous games and introduces quite a few changes for the better. its a steep learning curve, but once you know what youre doing youll be stomping across the map like the english empire reborn! im just shy of 400 hours game time as i write this review, 95% of this in multiplayer and im not bored of this game at all. if you enjoy games that span a few days, where your decisions really matter and every move can lead you to defeat or victory, buy this game - you will not regret it.",627.3

"a very fun game. i was a newcomer to turn-based strategy games before this. ive been thoroughly enjoying it so far, and i highly recommend getting it if you even remotely enjoy strategy titles. everything is well executed, and seamless. on another note, it is amusing playing as the roman empire and having nuclear technology. beware, this game will eat up hours upon hours. but youll enjoy every minute of this game.",54.2
"i found this game pretty fun, its the first civ game i ever played.",54.7

"i first saw a friend playing this and thought it looked fun. i never really decided to buy it until recently though. i saw a mod for the elder scrolls map in this game and decided to buy it. this is a great game. playing it consumes your time really fast though. i would highly suggest it. it offers a strategy game for any experience of player on a hexagonal map. this makes it more challenging than squares and the landforms are awesome. if you like gaming, you like this.",149.3
"great game, i recommed this game to anyone that loves rts or turn based strategy",411.0

"absolutely love this game to pieces. its great for a social occasion, get everyone with their mics on and play a game, even if it does cause bigger fights than monopoly. my biggest issue however, is that the achievements someimes dont unlock, which although dont count for anything can still be awfully annoying.",235.7

"never trust gandie. poldra folklore op. bretty gud game. nuke gandie",441.2
"this game is amazing. words cannot describe the sheer amount of fun i have playing civ 5. the already enjoyably vast content is expanded by the workshop. and if there is a civilization you want to play as that isnt already there, than most likely its already been added to the workshop. if you like a game where you can run your own empire in a hundred differnt ways, this is the game for you. i recommend everyone with at least a single commanding bone in their body get this game. only in civ5 will you here yourself saying, thank god ghandi is dead.",641.4
"at first i thought it was just going to be another one of those rts games, but now that i see it, and play i have done a complete 360. if anything, this is a smart game. its lush and challanging, and i have so much respect for that.",66.8
"civ 5 is the captain captain, the captain of all captains of all turn-based stragedy games. its really the mother of all tbs. its epic! as i have started with the game (civ 5 gold edition + brave new world), i played directly 12 hours at a time. you can really enjoy this game.",76.9

"the best thing i liked about this game was the realistic approach towards battle and improvements in a country of your choice. if you have the dlc for this game it gets even better! not only does one understand and go through a learning process since the beginning of time and how war was waged and how countries and small states had alliances with each other but you get to make your decisions and they effect you in the long run. you can play a short game starting from the nuclear era and nuke cities and civilizations or you can go back all the way when iron and coal was found and work your way up into a new era! superb game with great and realistic rulers, buildings, monuments, wonders and warfare. a must if you like strategy games or were a fan of games like generals. but believe me, this is way ahead of generals or any civilization game you have ever played !",34.3
"became a great entry with the gods and kings expansion. not worth it without it. if youre not interested in spending that much money, pick up iv gold.",72.1
"great game with many strategy elements. its a ton of fun, and totally worth the price.",339.9
"i like this game alot. there are quite a few ways to win at the game and all of them have their own ineresting aspects of it but i do suggest if you get the game to get gods and kings too. the vanilla version has pretty bad ai so their armies could sit att their base during a large part of the game but they get better in the gods and kings expansion. in brave new world it adds onto cultural victory and allows you to benefeit off of money even more. the ai also get more intelligent in the gods and kings expansion as well.",372.2
"fantastic game, better with the expansions. so fun to play.",145.0
"engrossing, worthy of the civiliaztion legacy. the hexes and stack removal make it very much more like a traditional tabletop wargame, something which i found enjoyable.",129.2
"great game! best money spent on a game so far with this account.",28.0
"great game. bugs need a bit of a sorting out and sometimes make the game not as fun but all together a fantastic experience. i would suggest civ 5 for all micro-management strategy fans out there.",111.4
"250h+ and still so much to learn, play and do! start with just civ5 and move to the expansions as you get bored with the mechanic and switch it up!",235.8
"got the basis civ for 19 euro, and goty update for 10 euro, all well worth it. game is fun as usual.",99.4
"civilization 5 is a great stragety game that can entertain for years. there are many things you can do in this game. i recommend it whole heartedly.",643.2
"its really fun. i dont think its fun without the gods and kings dlc. (havent gotten it yet but looking forward to it). there are many achievements as well.",511.4
"a true overhaul of the civilization franchise. this game brings in big changes. the most notable being the hex-based gameplay and the removal of unit stacking. those two things greatly change the way you play the game, and definitally for the better. the overlay is improved, and now when you end your turn the game doesnt pull you to each city and force you to choose what building/unit to build. which is a small, but much needed improvement. the new systems also make smaller empires more vialbe. being the biggest and baddest empire is no longer the primary concern. the game also makes it very easy to download and install mods, which further improves the game. its good, and feels like civilization while still offering a fresh experience.",174.5
"this game is really amazing if you play it with friends or add a few mods",226.9
"positives: diplomacy is very strong, combat is fluid, very balanced among ai and players, large variety of nations, use of steam workshop, can set up games to your liking and use of historical figures negatives: branching paths of upgrades could have been upgraded a bit more(too small), city-states have very little usefulness aside from getting a new unit every once in a while, and even though certain leaders have a specialized unit, they are actually the same as a normal one. verdict: 8.75/10 recommendation: to those with too much time on their hands. get it. now.",62.7
"this game is my favourite turn based strategy game i have ever play i would recommend this game to anyone who is in to any type of strategy game and has never played this.",6.4
"extremely addictive and time consuming game, you can play for hours and not realise because youre having that much fun!",27.0
"this game is way too addicting. one... more... turn...",48.0
"an awesome game of strategy. gives you an education bit too, world wonders, different empires, etc.",88.5
"one of the best games ive ever plyed, very relaxing and fun",318.2

"it is just to good! i bought it last weekend and already have 30 hours in it. if u can buy this game",184.0
"great game you can hours of fun and not even know it. all and all great game just wish it had a battle ground camra feature.",43.7
"this game is great to not only play alone but to also have a marathon with a couple of mates. worth every dollar and never gets old.",251.5
"this is a great game for a parent of a high maintenance infant. the game is turn based and will patiently wait for you to feed and change your kid. then come back and pick up where you left off!",62.4
"yes, yes, yes, yes, ... yes. if you are even just a little bit curious about this genre just try it. this game goes on sale often so if you dont want to pay the 30 dollar price tag because your not sure you can easily wait. although, in my opinion it is easily worth $100. you will lose your life with this game, you have been warned.",65.0
"very fun game to play on both singleplayer and multiplayer. great strategy game that allows you to test different scenarios that you choose to craft. highly recommended to you guys!",463.5
"this game is amazingly addictive... buy it! it has insane replayability, and you can download thousands of addons from the steam workshop to change the game for when (if) you actually do get bored of playing it.",231.0
"literally science or buying citystates and ruining friendships",134.5
"highly addictive. played every civ from 1 up to 5, and this is my favourite. tech tree is familiar if youve played the others but there are new additions, plenty of wonders to build, and the soundtrack is amazing and quite varied. if i had to make one complaint it would be the length of some of the battle animations, if someone attacks your city with several bombers you might as well take 5 and go for a snack, theyll still be circling and diving and bombing by the time you get back.",277.6
"one of the greatest turn based strategy games which is only made better by the dlc. i highly recommend the game and any dlc that peaks your interest at the very least buy the expansions if you really wanna up the gameplay features.",89.1
"i came from playing civilization revolution on ps3 to this, and this game is absolutely amazing. most of my hours on record are with gods & kings, but brave new world adds a whole new dimension and makes going for the culture victory fun and rewarding. guiding the many unique civilizations through 6000+ years of recorded history is rewarding in itself, but then throw on the different victory conditions and the mulitple options you have every time you set up a new game, and you are almost guaranteed to have an exciting and one of a kind game every time.",719.5
"very good strategy game and very fun to play with your friends very chaotic and sneaky to try and steal their tech. :)",49.2
"one of the best turn-based strategy games. totally recomendded!",93.4
"enjoy playing this game, lots of gameplay to it...",239.2
"this is one of those games i always find myself coming back to year after year. who doesnt like to start up a game vs. the cpu or vs. a family member and imagine the world domination machinations of ghandi or george washington. the games can go on for awhile or just a day but it never stops being fun to take over the world whether your favorite victory is military, cultural or through overt capitalism.",192.1
"a very addicting game. just a great, wich you need to buy !!",158.8
"originally i was very sceptical - for me version v had come way too fast after civ iv which i liked very. i changed my mind with the gods & kings expansion and now it is by far the most played game in my list. the gameplay is superb and i very much enjoy the co-op mode. there is no excuse not to own and play this game, as it is eternally replayable.",424.9
"been an avid player of civilization series since the very beginning on the amiga. a great addition to the series and a worthwhile buy for anyone who wishes to lose a weekend one does not simply play civilization for an hour",343.9
"8/10 very fun game but can get slightly repetitive.",58.0
"highly, fun turn base easy to understand and hours and hours of play.",188.3
"brilliant game, best strategy game i have ever played",32.6
"this game is a massive hit on statergy and fun because its a all round amount of awesomeness !!!!!!!!!",2.3
"best turn based game on the planet. i just wish the mods wouldnt crash.",275.5
"so addicting! you will say 1 more turn for hours on end!",103.4
"one of the first rtss to grace the computer game industry, and one of the greatest. using turn-based exploration, building, and combat you expand your civilization. win conditions include racing for culture, science, domination, and economy. play the game at a rushed pace, or take your time in a marathon session to achieve global victory.",88.5
"i never played a civ game in my life because i never thought much about it. that is, until my girlfriend recommended it to me during a steam sale is when i decided to get the game 12 bucks. i wasnt really expecting much, until i checked the time on my clock and discovered i spent around 10 hours playing straight with no breaks. it just goes to show that sid meier developed a time-machine. a time-machine that only sends you in the future with no control of how far you go. by the time you want to take a 15 minute break, youll discover you just played for days.",95.0
"it is a nice change from civ iv. not being able to stack a massive force on one tile made taking cities an actual challenge rather than a massacre. the religion aspect of the game is interesting, sometimes accepting another nations religion is actually better for you. the city states were helpful for the most part, but sometimes they would just spawn in a terrible area that would make settling annoying, especially when they pretty much surround your capitol. the detail of the tiles and cities was nice, even zooming up close they still had good detail. in the end i personally rate this game a 3.9/5",93.1
"great game! it blends together strategy, micro-managing, and action, to make the perfect genre!",552.0
"this is a great game!!! within the first hour i found myself hooked, and the mods make everything even better. this is the best turn-based strategy game out there. i would definatly recommened buying civ 5!",308.4
"the latest installment in a series that defined a genre, need i say more?",615.3
"awesome game, great polish and presentation, very easy to get started, and can really eat up your time into the wee hours of the night, in a fun way. with the newer patches, the game has become very strong in all modes. playing with friends is a blast. it gets better with time, and the new scenarios help mix up single player and add value to the dlc. all the civ dlc is pretty good, nebuchadnezzar is not quite worth it however. the map packs are a bit weak, as maps are random normally, and you can get map mods for free if you want specific maps. the developers are really showing this game love and support, so give it a chance.",162.8
"take sims right, and make it into civilizations. say you wanna be the french, youll start off with 1 settler and a warrior. you use your settler to make a settlement/city and use your warrior to go out exploring/hunting barbarians which are like bandit in tes games. people who cant even enjoy games because of motion sickness or multi-tasking can play this game because your not doing much movement. it is turn-based and if you play single player you can take as long as you want! if youre into world domination, world peace, or even building the first space shuttle you will be able to do that in civ5 and doing each of these requires certain things to do. so civ5 gets a 9/10 for me. if youre interesting in playing hotseat with me, pm me. tl;dr civ5 gets 9/10 because its best strategy game..",130.5
"always it comes down to a civilization game for me to get my fix for strat since the death of the c&c series i have really enjoyed the civilization series more now.",69.1
"awesome game! not as much micromanagement as civ iv but for me that is a good thing.",171.1
"10/10 would bang this game is so good it gives me an erection",151.3
"easy to get into, surprising level of sophistication, every game is different. its hard to stop playing!",386.4
"i love the civilization series so much. so intoxicatingly addictive that you just cannot stop playing. i would highly recommend the bnw expansion with 5 as it really improves the game.",285.4
"one unit per hex, combined with the fact that a nations capital has the same size as a company of archers makes for unintuitive cringe-worthy gameplay. on the plus side it looks good enough to make civ iv annoying to play.",13.0
"this game is wonderful the series has been running for ages and it is 10/10.",138.6
"if you like turned based strategy this is the game for you. countless hours fly by without even realizing it. multiplayer is there as well; its fun to get two other friends on the same team and watch your research skyrocket while you gang up on all the other cities. great game, well made, and all round fun to play.",81.8
"amazing game if you want to do a world domination game with friends or a.i.",76.6
"i vouch for this game if you got ocd like me. ill beat it, then say im gonna do it a different way next time around... then i done played it half a dozen times and still wanna try new ways.",292.6
"why havent you bought civilization v yet? you have? well, its time to kill that  ghandi once and for all! play for countless hours by yourself or with friends! you can even play senarios like the civil war. its too overwelming? get to know the game by playing the standard game without the dlc then once you get farmiliar with it, upgrade. 10/10, would civ v again.",132.6
"this game is so ing fun. its a relaxing game to play after a long day at work or a good workout. more fun with friends, like most games. definite buy.",78.5
"civ 5 is a great addition to the series after all this time since its release i still dont know what to make of the city states features or the removal of the stacking of troops. civ 5 is as addicting as all that have come before - a series i have played again and again since civ 1 came out.",233.5
"it one of the you dont thing your going to like , you start playing 80 hour+ you cant get off the game . it one game want you start you dont stop .",132.4
"if by any chance you happend to see this on sale... simply buy. i find myself constantly be back in this game to the drawing board. even if i wont spend but a few hours at a time leading my civilization to glory or destruction, its always a joy non the less. :) 8/10",174.2
"civilization v is, simply put, the greatest strategy game of all time. i highly recommend this wonderful game to anyone even remotely serious about gaming; it is an absolute must. civilization v is easily a 10 out of 10, and stands at the top of the mountain as the undisputed strategy experience of a lifetime.",532.1
"this is one of the absolute best games i have played. every civilization is balanced, and it is great fun! it costs alot, but you should get it! by the way, if you can, get the dlc, it totally changes the game! (to the better)",7.5
"this game is quite addictive, youll play for quite a while.",76.4
"an amazing game about ruling the world, going to space, and dropping nukes. need i say more?",176.5
"this game is a huge time-sink, and for all the right reasons! each game you play, wether multiplayer or against the excellently done a.i will provide hours upon hours of strategic challenges and an excellent system of micromanagement. with the several different victory conditions and tons of different civilizations to play (each with their own unique bonuses, units and buildings) this game caters for every possible strategy. definitely a recommended game - civ 5 is a great play for veterans of the series and for newcomers.",277.1
"great game as long as you have paitence and dont quit like 20mins into the game. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gods & kings is a great expansion adding religon, new units, new civs, espionage, new buildings, new tecs. five stars sid meier much better than the clustered insanity of alpha centari.",230.6
"an amazing game that may take a lot of time out of your day,but playing with the right friends will make this game the funnest it could be.",41.4
"the hex grid combat made combat more dynamic but the overall ga,e dept suffered before any expansions. after brave new world and gods and kings wererelease the game became a complete experice. many of the smal;l dlc felt like nickle and dimeing the gamer. they should have been added to the base game. but the game is stupid addictive and deep. so i give it a remomendation.",295.5
"the most epic game ive ever played (and i have minecraft)",173.2
"very fun game, but i feel that it is a lot better with some of the dlc",24.4
"really, the best part about brave new world is that its finally addressed every victory condition in the game and made each one not only more equally viable, but also just as busy. weaponizing culture works to bring it more in line with the other conditionsits something you have to work towards and not something you just happen to achieve. on top of that, the diplomacy changes make this system more interesting as well, and it all comes down to one thing: if you have civilization v and want to play more, you owe it to yourself to get this expansion.",152.4
"this game is fun. countless hours of enjoyment await you if you decide to play it. i prefer to play eith others, but this game still manages to pull me in for times when im alone.",3.0
"god jesus this game is . buy it if you havent already, im serious. this is such an amazing strategy game. you wont be dissappointed.",61.7
"yeah, lets just put all these empires on a map where they arent really. but dont worry, it doesnt need to make sense when you are winning.",10.3
"be warned, once you start playing, itll be hard to stop. definately one of the most addictive games available. a must buy if you enjoy turn-based strategy games like xcom.",192.6

"amazing game , id recommend it to anybody. one of the rts games around. a must buy",66.7
"i would personally suggest this game for anyone who like strategy games and the previous civilizations.",475.7
"this game is a beast strategy game with great graphic and is just fun :d",145.6
"civilization v is just easily an incredible game. before you complain about how its nothing like civ iv, well, deal with it. theyre not the same game. if they wanted to make a better version of civ iv, they wouldve just added another mod pack, wouldnt they? civ v has a broad selection of mods and abilities, and there is not quite another feeling much like obliterating your technologically inferior rivals with the heel of your giant death robots. (no, im not kidding. that is their name. and they kersplode everything. except certain mod units.) seriously, though, but it.",598.5

"this is a very addictive game, there are so many options for the maps and the opponents and everything, there is technology, history, science, culture, strategy, warfare, tactics, and more all combined, i created a game with all 14 civilizations and i have spent 3 days on just that game, and it is still not finished, but i have a glorious empire soon to crush germany, then either the empire down on the bottom right or egypt. my idea is play with large continents, take over one of them completely and then fortify it and do what you wish from there.",102.5
"never trust japan. this game is amazing and i had trouble leaving the computer for so long only because of this game. the expansions completely changes up the game and so when you think youre done, you try g&ks or bnw and instantly the game feels fresh. truly and amazing games that is worth the 1000s of hours youll end up having put itno it.",116.8
"this game is fun when playing against humans. its terrible playing against ai. the npcs are way too predictable and non-threatening. if you build up your military quickly, you can overrun them every time. graphics are better than previous civs, but still just ok. ui and tutorials are good.",82.1
"i would love this game but it i get so far and it shuts down every time.",51.0
"this is an amazing game. you can easily spend hours on end playing and it has matches that can last easily over 20 hours. with varying difficulty levels, it allows both casual and hardcore gamers a tough experience. although, the game is a bit incomplete and unbalanced without the expansions, it is still a good base game. i strongly recommend getting brave new world and gods and kings along with the game. it adds so much more functionality and realism to it. ive sunk many hours into it and it is by far one of my favourite games of all time. with hours of replayability, you can entertain yourself forever with this game.",287.8
"the last civilization i played was civilization iii and after that i didnt expect, that i would buy another civilization, bcs the balancing was really bad, but in civ v the balancing is much more better!!! (in civ iii: enemies declared war, when you didnt gave them the atomic bomb in exchange for the wheel thechnology -.-) since it lasted a long time, when i played a civ before, i got into the game again really fast, bcs its really newbie-friendly. i really like the graphics of the cities on the map (tiny monuments :3), but the streets are horrible ^^ (maybe i upload a screenshot to show you, then you know, what i mean ^^)",57.2
"still flaming mad about spending 13 hours on a campaign just to have the huns convince everyone to attack me. it is a great (albeit time consuming) strategy game. im interested in trying the turn by turn play. 9/10",17.7

"one of the best historal battle games ever made! this game will drive you crazy as you want to build your empire more and destroy other empires even more! you will discover the attitude and grow relationships with other empires as well as start wars and take over citys. this is one of the best games ive ever played, and in my opionion one of the best games on steam and in stores!",784.5
"gotta play this game, complicated, but great great fun",60.4
"a much more welcoming civilization game and frankly found it more fun in this that civ iv. rather than remaking civ iv than, this civ game has its own identity with a overhauled (and significantly better) combat, completely unique civilizations and a different winning conditions especially with bnw. my problems with this are: *the modding, is not as flexible as its predesscecors *those freaking load times are long and show up everywhere even in the menus. *the diplomacy is really barebones such as not being able to see what others civs think of others",61.9

"if you like strategy this game is for you! it is the perfect game if you like forming a civilization and conquering the world in many different ways",117.6
"fun game, great strategy elements and combat elements. its very awesome to watch your small settlement grow over thousands of years into a world power (or fail trying). very highly recommended, just make sure you have a few hours set aside when you play. they forgot to put for min sys req: 8 hours for game session.",94.5

"civilization 5 is a very addictive game. between the expansion packs, the steam workshop mods and the addictive gameplay, you could be spending your entire life playing it. i recommend this game. i also recommend the two expansions packs gods and kings and brave new world. they both add a lot of new content to the game.",160.4
"theres nothing more fun than leading china to world domination :)",81.0
"excellent addition to the civilization franchise. it took a while to get used to the new culture system, but i would highly recommend this game to any fans of civ.",49.4
"intensely fun if you like turn based race games of which this franchise began (as far as i remember from my youth). a little buggy, but not so bad that it detracts from the game once you get in. in game animations go away durring multiplayer mode, which annoyed my brother but didnt bug me.",95.8
"a welcome addition to the civ family. has some definite imporvements from four, including a new hex grid system. downgrades include the loss of troop stacking.",75.2

"endless strategic fun to be had here, just be prepared for long game time!",63.6
"one of the most addicting and fun games ever made. if your new to civ you probably shouldnt buy any dlc until later because it makes the game much more complex. my only problem with the game is that the ai is sometimes not very smart and once you have played for over 100 hours you will not find it hard to win.",164.2

"a very good turn based stategy game with a very good combat system and numerous ways to win. the choice of civilisations is also very good, each being specialised in their own way, be it for a domination victory or a cultural one. there is however one big issue with the game that i find really annoying; the automatic camera. the camera will jump to the next unit that needs orders, this can be sometimes be good, however it jumps to units all over the map, rather than the closest ones. overall it is a good game and i reccomend that you get it.",391.7
"civilization v is one of those must play games before your computer dies. civilization is a strategic based game in which you choose your faction, and build an empire to dominate the map. the biggest selling point of this game is that it is not specific to one period. as your technology and research progresses, so do your cities, and you can find yourself marching towards the modern era. civilization can also be played on single or multiplayer, which is a great asset to a unwavering game. the game play, although a little predictable, is very enjoyable and you will find yourself missing your bed time as you charge your forces into new and distend lands. very few games can provide this endless type of enjoyment, and for such a simple game, it is remarkable how addictive this game can become.",34.8

"a great strategy game that is easy to play singleplayer or with others, and very easy to pick up on.",52.5
"this game gets 0/10 budder blocks hail sky. its full of a bunch of squids who think they can run a country. they also dont let you mine budder and make shrines to lord sky. this needs a remake or a dlc to add budder and move it up to my standards hail sky",80.2
"5 out of 5 stars. easily the best pc strategy game, even for being a few years old now. civ 5 is a legendary game that includes so many strategic decisions to be made. the multiplayer is always fun, and the singleplayer is not bad also. would recommend to anyone of any experience level with pc gaming.",597.5
"an addicting, strategic masterpiece putting you in position to rewrite all of human history from the moment we discovered agriculture. a game that will have to getting pissed at america for building the pyramids before you do, and will have you clapping at your own cleverness when you convince genghis khan to help you attack egypt.",350.3
"awesome game, many choices of winning and different leaders to play. can play for hours without stopping",89.3
"another game of the category why is the sun rising already?. this is not a fast-paced game, you can easily sit there for ten hours straight and enjoy the calming, yet epic music. of course it lacks the historical background of total war or europa universalis, but it gives you an entirely different sort of satisfaction to build your empire from scratch, to place every single city. you have to consider strategical positions, ressources, farmland - and all that while your civilization advances from dusts of the ancient era to the invention of the internet. the diplomacy of a multiplayer game is much more fun than reading game of thrones, but you can always try to achieve your goals peacefully (except when you live next to gandhi).",448.3
"few games hold the as high replay value as this franchise does. even if its been stripped of the micromanagement the previous installments had, civ5 adds a whole new combat system that by itself makes this game worth to play.",636.4
"best sim stradegy game ever. why dont you own this game yet?!",879.5
"i loved playing this game, ive put countless hours into it and still find the fact that i can win in thousands of other ways amazing. anyone even remotely interesting an a strategy game should pick this up.",394.6
"if you like civilization this is a definite keeper!",71.1
"get it, its really fun. however, do not ever make gandhi angry once he has completed the manhattan project. his words are backed by atomic bombs.",68.0
"its very hard to stop playing! feels like playing monopoly or risk when played with a couple friends.",80.9
"the premier multiplayer simultaneous turn based game out there. rich in variety and options. late game is the only weakness as games may bog down, however the game is still fantastic.",597.8
"it is my first civilization game ever and im addicted!",474.9
"one of the best civilization games, or for that matter empire building games, to date. be tactical, be religious, be cultural, be scientific... the possibitlys are endless...",114.0
"addictive, challenging, and ridiculously fun. wholeheartedly recommended.",561.3
"civilization v is truly the best game when it comes to building your own civilization. its complex, its beautiful, and you will find yourself playing more than you planned. beautiful experience worth playing and adding expansions.",18.6
"this game is beyond awesome. what else is there to say",74.0
"i think the better question is: why shouldnt you get this game?",287.1
"love it, enjoying it more than total war series. politics, strategy and religion are much more important than just making an army.",61.5
"ok sid this game is nice and all but youre not getting any of those dlc funbux from me until multiplayer ing works",36.5
"beautiful game. i play this for hours and hours without losing interest. sid meiers games are one of a kind.",272.6
"just buy it now, play it for a bit, then look at time played! enjoy :d",148.3
"when youre playing civilization, history becomes your creation, learn to write before you can read and build the taj majal right in cleveland!",549.9
"civ v is great. although it seems blasphemous to say, i like the hexagonal tiles, the no-unit-stacking rule, the addition of a maintenance cost to roads, the ability of cities to defend themselves, and the various other changes relative to its predecessors. overall, civ v makes small actions (like connecting a city to your empires road network) seem significant and large actions (like building a wonder) seem genuinely game-changing. if you want the best experience i recommend getting the gods & kings expansion, which fine-tunes some mechanics, like civic policies, and adds others, like religion. religion, in particular, is much improved over civ iv.",227.3
"this tbs (turn-based strategy) game is probably the latest and greatest of its genre. there is a good reason the civilization game series has had 5 releases, because they are great games which reek of success. it should be noted however that these types of games are not for everyone. this game is most approprate for those who have a real appreciation for strategy and possess a lot of patience.",624.0
"to be honest, i prefered civilization iv until the release of brave new world : this add-on makes the game much better than the original one (or even gods and kings) ! still, the game without any add-on is good, but at least take the gold edition, not so more costly than the basic one. :-)",136.6
"this game is a game. someone told me to get this game. it is game.",42.4
"the best of the saga. full-stop. only negative thing i have to say is the graphics: good overall, nothing jaw-dropping...but why its so heavy on a graphics card only sierra knows",156.2
"great game. just make sure you get the expansions.",296.3
"awesome, and even more awesome way to game with mod enhancements. many ways to alter ur view of play.",691.5
"this game is really cool.shows alot of potential and is work into it.i reccomend this game to everyone that likes stragety games.",178.2
"pretty darn good game. gameplay is smooth and responsive and the ai is pretty intelligent. i like the idea of running a civilization and being able to conquer others. only thing is the dlc is expensive.",89.5
"you play as the undisputed dictator of your own nation in this fantastic national socialist germany simulator, you win can through other methods like diplomacy but thats no fun.",53.7
"excellent turn-based strategy. its like risk, monopoly, and simcity combined.",108.2
"just one more turn, one more campaign i swear... (6 hours later). not recommended for low-end computers, as late-game turn processing can make the game lag and heat up your computer. definitely play dx11 mode if you can handle it though, its much prettier to look at and you get animated world leaders.",221.5
"i highly recommend this game, one match could keep you entertained for hours!",142.9
"great game, played for years. as soon as i tried to utilize the steam cloud functions though, the entire thing crashed. now, every time i try to load or save a game the program crashes to desktop. ive been in communication with steam support for 9 days now and they keep giving me the runaround with solutions that are not affecting my problem at all. 2k support didnt even bother responding to my request. whats more, right before all this happened i encouraged two friends to buy this game, now i cant play with them at all. im terribly vexed.",276.0
"i think the civilization series is great. overall i give it a 8/10 concept: same as other civilzations, 7/10 gameplay: outstanding at how many options there are! 8/10 graphics: incredable: 10/10 price: waaaaaaaay too pricy,but thats what happens to big company games. wait a couple of years it will go down though.",77.7
"i think i permanently damaged my right arm by playing this game.",134.9
"the brave new world expansion basically saved this game. it fixed all the issues i had with the base game. both diplomacy and the latter half of the game has been given a tremendous face lift. civ v is now on par with, if not more fun than, civ iv.",182.3
"the endless possibilities, scenarios, and beautifal gameplay make civ 5 an easy game to lose hundreds of hours in. smart and stylish civ 5 will can make burning the midnight oil easy. it really does embody all the greatest things about the franchise and the expansion packs fill in all the wholes left in the original game. highly recommend this title.",270.0
"a board game that could only exist as a video game, with an immense amount of depth. its easy to play and almost impossible to master, and its a different game every time you play it. pick up both major dlcs (brave new world and gods and kings) for the best possible experience.",73.6
"one last turn! fans of the civlization franchise have been screaming since the series inception and civ v is no exception. with many mechanics being overhauled and refined, every bit of the game is even better than the predecessor. fan or not you must check out this game, for it will consume your life (in the best way possible of course).",24.6
"for strategy nerds, history nerds and anyone who wishes to see wild inaccuracies in history just for teh lulz (the aztecs conquering the french? who knew?) its a great timesink for anyone craving strategy. its good for newbies and experts alike, ranging between i can do this to the ai is straight up cheating a personal favorite thing about this game is that it plays in turns (so you can watch some tv or whatever and wont lose because you got distracted) and that it doesnt require precise controls, making it perfect for playing in a laptop without external mice or keyboards",188.0
"culture, science, religion... gold.. these are the stuff of civilization. an excellent marriage of strategy, turn-based combat, and resource managment. lose sight of your civilizations goal... and neighbouring leaders may leave you in the dust. leaders come and go... cities crumble... so too will the tangible relationships of your family and friends as you whisper to yourself just one more turn",66.9
"great game. it will ruin your life. seriously, buy this.",438.2
"civ 5 is one of the greatest games i have ever played!!!",130.3
"love this game so much. if you like strategy games this is a must have.",127.5
"excellent strategy game that is almost impossible to stop playing",191.9
"played a game at 2 pm, was not even halfway done at 12 am! very fun, and time will fly.",70.4
"hope you like the opening cinematic cause its unskippable for the most part and you see it everytime you load the game",67.9
"picked this up about 1.5years ago cause it was dirt cheap in a steam sale. never played it till this week and i have to say this game is amazing! i never saw myself as a fan of turn based games but my god is this game addictive. youll find yourself starting a game and all of a sudden its 5 hours later at 3am.",65.5
"absolutely amazing game, gives me shivers whenever i watch the trailer.",279.5
"you actually need to think to be successful. plus, where else can you nuke whomever you wish? 10/10 (and get bnw!)",240.7
"what can i say that others havent? this is a great game that i keep coming back to!",388.7
"civilization 5 is an amsing game if you just want to play as your favourite civilisation eg,rome,grease,america and england. this game will take you alot of your time ,a short game can go on for 8-10 hours.civ also has amsing mod supourt that are easily acsesed by seam work shop",67.0
"it is just civ, in a new look, but im loving it and play it for hours",429.1

"brilliant game, you will likely end up playing til like 4am saying just one more turn",247.9
"hours of possible playtime, and many facits to enjoy",343.8
"must buy. no more needs to be said, absolutely amazing!",70.7
"dont buy this should you desire to live a productive life.",14.8
"after playing civ i, ii, iii and iv + expansions - this is one of the finest! little midgame inbalances though.",444.5
"an exceptional political simulator. whether you are a micromanager wanting to ensure that every detail is right in you thriving civilization, or you are just a warrior with a lust for strategic battle this game will satisfy you.",323.0
"hugely addicting game, i play for hours and its as if only a few minutes have gone by.",65.0
"you die a hero or you live long enough to become a villain",231.4
"i have long been a fan of the civilization style of games, though ill be honest, alpha centauri is my favorite sid meiers title of all time. all time. with that said, civ 5 is by far the most polished game, and with all of the addons coming in at the original cost of the game, im more than content to pay the price. hours and hours of gameplay and replayablilty. modability adds in even more replay value. steam workshop compatible! definitely a game for someone looking to do more than point a gun at something...",111.8
"the defining modern civilization simulator. everything is excellent, makes even the best computers hot with all the amazing engine work and calculations it does.",452.7
"probably the most fun ive had in a game for 10 years. easy enough on the lower difficulties to get a hang for the game, and hard enough once raised to difficulty 6+ to continue challenging your strategies.",322.8
"stunning and beautifull graphics, immence gameplay x",19.6
"i started playing civilization v when it first came out over 3 years ago. i still love it. this is my favorite game of all time.",719.4
"this game is fun, but complicated to learn. i would recomend this to experienced strategy players who a looking for a nice smooth game. there is a variety of ways to play, and new map sgenerated everytime! it also has a very good multiplayer system, you can play with turns, or even at the same time! hanks for reading this recomendation, i hope you choose to buy this wonderful game.",30.4
"civ v is one of the best computer games i have ever played. the 2 dlcs, g&k and bnw, are totally worth buying. they both change the game a lot but it is in a good way. the amount of community mods that are aviable are exceptional. they add a ton of great content and make the game even better. i would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.",73.5
"awesome game. it is definetly something you have to play as a gamer who loves strategy and economics.",140.8
"just 5 more turns... just a few more turns. just one more turn. alright, ill finish this research then im done for the night. just one more turn. ok, i really should stop... after this turn. ill save and ill close the game - after this turn. its 6am and im still playing, after this turn i should probably go to sleep... ive lost control of my life im ed.",116.3
"far too often has been the cause of 6am bedtimes. fantastic",50.6
"good game if u like turn based rts games but get all the dlc as the original is balls",113.8
"if you love stratagy, city building, and crafting your own empire, you will not be dissapointed 10/10",101.4
"hours of fun. gives me just one more turn syndrome. mods help extend its longevity. expansions make it way better.",29.0
"great game, if you get the dlcs called g&k and bnw. only thing i have against it is that mods are not supported for multiplayer.",756.6
"this is simple. if you like turn-based strategy games, this is the king, the must-have of these games. get it on sale off of steam if you must, but get it, you will not regret it.",465.7
"such a fun tb game to play. if you like playing turn based strategy games, obliterating enemies, or just want to try something new, civ v is the game to play!!!",74.6
"great game, you have to understand the game is great!!!!!! but if you dont know how to play, dont give up instantly... actually try to learn it. if you dont know what youre doing youll love it.",434.7
"one of the best ways to spend a day, literally. you will spend at minimum 8 hours playing this game once you have it. be warned.",99.3
"fantastic playthrough and very involved multiplayer. have spent too much of my life on this ^.^",174.1
"hm wow what is there to say about civ five.... a whole lot. its a good game",23.9
"a good game with some good ideas. however the ai is still severely lacking (especially after playing betterai with civilization 4). the new happiness system is still really hard to use. the ai receives bonuses in this regard (and with most other things too)",172.6
"great game i enjoy it each time i play, it makes you think",842.7
"when you start playing this game time gets away from you way too fast! excellent game cant wait for civilization: beyond earth",72.1
"great game if you are looking to destroy hours of your time. for achievement hunters like myself, there is always one more thing to do; and the multiple offical mods are fun (not to mention the unoffical ones). pick your favorite historical figure and mess up history like a kitten with a ball of yarn!",559.7
"one of the best 4x series and the 5th installment does not disappoint.",79.4
"civ 5 is an awesome game if you are patient and like strategy games. if you are not patient or do not like strategy games you will not like this game at all. before you start you pick a civilization to rule as, the lenth of the game, the size of the map determining the amount of other civivlizations, the map shape, and the difficulty. then you start the game and play as your civilization you picked from 4000 bc to 2050 ad or until you win or get taken over. there are a few different victories; cultural, scientific, economic, and domination victories. you can also play after you win so you can take over any county, win the un, or launch a space program whatever you want to do. i would recommend this game for any one with a decent amount of patients.",42.1
"its an excellent 4x game. its almost like a really comprehensive version of risk but on your computer. offers very large replay value has a high skill ceiling while still being accessible for new comers. easy to play hard to master. would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a quality strategy game.",68.2
"civilisation v is a quite complex (and lengthy) strategy game. if you are into strategy games and have several hours to kill, then civ v is my prefered game of choice. despite what you may hear, even the worst of computers can run civ. however the problem with civ v is that for it to be a decent game you need to get dlc. i personally suggest saving up about 30-40 and buying all the dlc in the summer sale, where it is much cheaper.",173.9
"a game intricate enough to make me not desperate to win it. the game play is fun enough on its own, without the added joy of beating someone.",49.6
"civilization v is a perfect strategy game. if youre new to strategy games you will still love it and it offers you hundreds and hundreds of hours for gameplay. multiplyer is amazing too espically with friends. also try to buy the brave new world expansion pack. that will enhance the game and youll play it even more. even the angry army supports this game. (angry joe).",452.6
"it is super fun to play and you learn a new thing very time you play",325.0
"great strategy game that gets better with each release. my initial impression was that a lot of features were simplified, but after several playthoroughs the strategic heart of civilization proved itself alive and well. just one more turn, is alive and well here.",90.5
"my go-to game since i joined steam -- and while havent logged as many hours as some -- this game has an unbelievable amount of replay value.",100.8
"awesome game! the single player mode is flawless and the bnw expanison pack gives cultural victories more interesting. one major flaw is the multiplayer. the game tends to truggle towards the mid/late game period. player discconnect more often the longer the games goes on and it makes it very hard to complete a full game. however still and amazing game.",238.7
"such a fun addicting turn-based strategy game. its very indepth with all the different civilization leaders and their different playstyles.",204.2
"give at-least 6 hours of free time before attempting to play youve been warn. you will be glued to your screen.",172.7
"one of the greatest games i have ever played it just never stops surprising me.",230.9
"is a good game, get the dlc though. and dont play from 8 pm to 5 am. ps",410.7
"this game is a looooooooooooooooooooot of fun. defs recommend.",42.4
"simply stated, the civ franchise is the best turn-based strategy games. civ5 has done the franchise justice while continue to improve the game overall from its predecessors.",999.6
"this game is addicting and can be super intense and relaxed at the same time. if that makes any sense.",34.7
"best stratigy game out there. compex but simpe, and there is plenty of epic civ 5 falures, and even victorys. buy it now, and i am off to play civ 5.",147.8
"civ v is definitely a breakthrough performance compared to other strategy games i have played. it is turn based instead of real time strategy, which for some that is a plus. this is a great game to sit down and conquer the world with or against your friends. i highly reccomend this to anyone who enjoys the build-em-up style of gaming and also to anyone who enjoys a good strategy game!",164.1
"i havent played this much, but i enjoyed what i have played! it is a great game, probably better when played online!",5.0
"if you have a lot of free time its game for you :))",105.0
"the game takes some time to get into however once you do get into the triumph and conquering youll never want to stop winning!!!!!",459.1
"highly addicitive and fast paced - this game is perfect for any fans of turn based strategy games and is a brilliant starting point for people who want to play them. the plethora of leaders and winning conditions make the replayability of this game huge. i highly recommned it! :)",210.2
"its an awsome game just a bummer that you have to buy all extations",77.9
"an immense time-sink. the amount of variables in map generation, civilisations and the tech trees means you will never have the same game twice. incredibly fun and great to play with friends making secret alliances and sudden betrayals. thouroughly recommended.",196.9
"turn based strategy thats accessible to you, your mom, your dad, your sister, your friends, her friends, his friends... everyone, basically. 10/10. get the dlc, too. just brave new world if your trying to save cash-moolah. it really rounds out the game.",333.8
"if youre looking for a more challenging, but slow paced strategy game with a huge amount of content. this is the game for you. probably the most complicated rts game ive ever played, but isnt that what makes it fun? :p you start off from an ancient civilization and move up to each era as you finish researching each breakthrough in our human history. (except for the future era) ;p this turned-based game will have you pressing next turn again and again even after saying okay, next turn im done. good luck and have fun with this game. :d",100.8
"spend 6 years building your empire only for it to be destroyed by the one known as gandhi",21.7
"an excellent way to try to rule the world. really, no part of this game fails to work.",42.8
"reason why you should play? play as gandi and behead adolf hitler. thats why.",151.1
"this game is a time machine. if you spend 5 minutes playing, you are teleported 3 hours into the future.",33.6
"worst fps moba rts third person rpg ive ever played. 10/10 would play again tho.",0.5
"civilization v is one of the best games ive ever played. buy it.",138.9
"its like risk except ghandi nukes the  out of you if you piss him off (which is always so kill that skinny little  first.)",6.4
"history lesson in a game. this game is a huge immersive time sink! they should call it virtual crack instead. highly recommend for anyone with a thinking brain!",48.3
"an awesome game well worth buying if you have the time to play and are wanting of a challenge.",222.3
"i was never much of a strategy guy myself (save some strat rpgs when i was younger) and this game got me hooked on the genre! if youve never played a strategy game before, give civ a try. itll introduce you to turn-based strategy mechanics gradually, but always give you room to make your own goals and do what you want. while the game is pretty damn deep its not as esoteric and complex as most newcomers to strategy games think they all are. you just have to accept that the game is not going to be realistic in the slightest. altogether id recommend this to anyone whos been scared to try out a strategy game, since strategy fans probably know all about it by now.",43.2
"great turn based game taking the time to invest into it, and checking out the comminuty workshop etc makes this a game you should play seriously atleast once then all the fun can happen afterwards great single player, with or without add ons and additions, multiplayer can be fun but prepare to spend alot of time playing it, especially if you choose a slow game pace with 8 players...could be loading and saving the game for months great game though",255.7
"awsome!!!!!!!!! its sooo good that i played it for hours, and never trust most of the other leaders some times they can really stab you in the back so hard that you lose the game.",191.6
"excellent game. you will lose sleep playing this game. good repeatability and re-playability. one of the best games ive owned. expansions are actually old fashioned expansions as they add to the original game.",443.3
"ive always been a fan of the civ games, so i was of course excited to get back into them with this edition. its great for passing time and fans of casual and turn based games. give it a try",4.5
"you wouldnt think a game about ancient civilisations would be fun, how wrong i was...",19.3
"hands down, *the best* real time strategy game ive ever played. engrossing, long-lasting matches, excellent multiplayer, and nearly infinite replay value. civ just cant be beat.",159.0
"just when you thought you were out, they pull you back in again. and again. and again.",245.2
"i think best turn-based strategy game ever.once you play you cant quit anymore :)",436.5
"really enjoyable game, keeps you entertained for hours",29.2
"i had to quit because ghandi kept ing me over. 9/10 its ok.",38.4
"fantastic game - once you get past the learning curve that is!",279.2
"fun strategy game, enjoyable. except for the warmongering ghandi.",91.4
"its a very good game. very historical civs and technologys. i recommend because i love this game.",65.2
"this game is pretty good, but after about 50 hours, i got bored of it. still a good game though.",78.1
"i have so many hours logged on this game and all of them were good ones. i love this game",160.0
"*do not buy this game if you have no self control or are really stubborn. with that being said, it has been a while since i have gotten this addicted to a game, my only complaint is that i have stayed up way to late playing a game because i have to keep taking turns! a fun game and its laid back! so yeah, i reccomend this if you dont want to have a social life any more!",370.6
"multiplayer needs serious work. play delay for quiters, and game passwords",790.5
"hours will turn into days, days into weeks... i hope you remembered to feed the cat.",127.6
"historically accurate representation of famous world leaders such as mahatma duke nukem ghandi 10/10, its alright. - ign",443.6
"now im not saying its a bad game, but you better have nothing else to do for the entire day because this game takes forever to finish a match. but if your playing single player, you could obviously save the game and continue it later, in multiplayer its really hard to finish a complete match. but if you just want to pass some time then buy it",102.9
"if you get this amazing game be sure to clear your schedule. but this game is a freaking amazing game that will have you spending hundereds of hours on.",266.7
"would recommend to people who like being randomly attacked by france and montezuma.  those s",131.5
"this game will leave you geeked out for dayssss. overall fun as hell!!!",267.5
"this game has taken away my life, its highly addictive and therefore much enjoyable. o wait, its my turn again, gotta go!",323.5
"i though this was the worst strategy game ever... i was wrong! with the brave new world this game is one of the bests. it is hard to learn and boring to wait turns but diplomacy, war, trades, civilization... every single this is great. buy it.. no no wait... buy both civi 5 and the next game: beyond earth...",24.7
"great and fun game, worth its cost during summer sale!",18.7
"its civilization so what really needs to be said about it that hasnt already. really the most important thing to know is this has to be one of the easiest to get into.there is so much stuff that easy to find when you need it but not in your face when you dont. you can far better understand what your units are able to do, and moving them around feels like a really good of chess sort of. plus you have so many ways to win that you almost always get some thing new to play with.",149.4
"great game but the price of the dlc is beyond stupid. stop selling games in peices to me!",288.7
"this game is amazing! its a board game that you can play online with friends and family!",126.2
"if you have enough time to play it (except you never want to finish a longer match), this game is totally worth it. balance isnt an issue either in this game. would r8 8/8 m8",95.4
"great game and is loads of fun for any strategy enthusiast",336.3
"timesink. the feeling of just one more turn is so big in this game, its ridiculous. recommended to get it with gods and kings. the dlc/add-on, makes the game so much better.",22.9
"civilzation v is one of if not the best turn based stratergies ever. not only does it include difficult choices that have a direct impact on empire but it also opens up a whole new world of imagination where you can create and mould the world as you see fit diplomaitcaly or forcefully. create your own alternate reality today and buy this game. 10/10",420.5
"kinda steep learning curve, but as soon as you grasp the basics you will lose yourself in this game, it has so many things going for it, from the nice clean layout to the different victories, civilisation v will keep you interested for a long, long time.",163.3
"whether civilization v is better than iv is a debate that has raged on for many years. in my own opinion, this game is the superior of the two, mostly due to the expansions. yes, it sucks to no longer have to worry about the health of your cities, and golden ages happen far too frequently, but at the same time, the combat and movement systems are far improved, and you wont have to worry about having massive stacks of hundreds of units just to have an effective military. if youre new to civ, this game is the best choice for you, but if youve been playing civ for a long time, iv might be more up your alley.",117.3
"this is probably the most amazing game ever made.. but it also takes all of my free time.. sooooo much time..",876.7
"my definition of a perfect game! takes quite some time to get used to and learn, but once you do, there is no limit to how many hours you will want to play this game! spent 100+ hours on the campaign edition (not through steam)",133.3
"even just the base game is so in depth in every aspect. if you set down to play you better have at least six hours to play. incredible game 10/10",211.7

"this is possibly the most awesome game ive ever bought. seriously. you can jump in without ever having played the other civilization games, as it has a full tutorial. there is masses of dlc you can download. though that being said, you can play the game a thousand times, and itd be different every time - so the dlc isnt necessary to enjoy the game.",179.1

"i am new to the series, wtf did i wait so long for? i have never played this type of game ever, but i was hooked after about 30min in my first game, literally once i started to figure out what i was doing i considered calling into work at about 3am in the morning..lol..theres a pretty good learning curve if youve never played one of these but i highly recommend it..side note: i bought the complete edition off of greenmangaming for $25 and activated it on here...",4.0
"this game is one of the most amazing games i have played in my life. i recommend getting the game and at least one of the dlcs because it just makes the game 10 times better, and the more you get, the more fun you have. trust me if sid doesnt make another civ game i will flip out .... i recommend you get this masterpiece.",891.9
"i played this game for a long time before i got the steam version. i got the steam version for all of my friends, but since i have been playing since civ 2, nobody wanted to play after a couple of matches. i great way to say goodby to long stretches of time.",46.9
"i have to say this is probably the most addicting game i play. youll tell yourself that youre only going to play through one more turn...only one more...okay this is the last one...until finally the sun is coming out and you hate yourself. the only con is that the game really needs the gandk and bnw. it really makes it a complete game.",147.3
"another fantastic installment in the civilization franchise. i have been playing since the original version and although they evolve and change release to release, they always deliver. civ 5 is no exception.",266.2
"by far the most detailed game in comparison with other sid meiers civilization games. if you do not mind killing time for 4-5 hours per game then you will love this game. not only does the game introduce new mechanics, but it also allows the players to play a leader throughout time and change the fate of history... forever!",660.2
"civ is an odd game. to someone with no knowledge of ancient civilizations, its mystifying, having dozens set out before you. but its great. and dont think, because its a bit confusing, youre getting flung in at the deep end. there are highly intuitive controls, and great tutorials (totally optional). i seriously recommend this game, and hope that you get it at some point.",115.8
"its really fun if you have time on your hands. its better if you have friends to play with.",50.3

"the most addictive game on this side of alpha centauri! seriously, this game is great and you should get it.",389.9
"ive been playing civ since it first came out. this version works well with steam and on the mac. the units and action are enjoyable. lots of content included in the basic version. theres a slew of downloadable content. my only complaint are some interface bits that could be better explained. looking forward to downloading all of the dlcs.",12.9

"ive got over 50 hours played but the funny thing is, is that ive only sat down to play it maybe 8-9 times......so lets just say i developed the wait one more turn then im done disease. you will too i guarantee.do yourself a favor and just buy it.",56.2

"civ v is one of those games that you cant really say no to. as a turn based strategy made by the famous sid meier, this game lives up to the name of civilization. although ive encountered a few, but rare bugs in the game (such as a ship magically jumping into a lake from the sea) this game is a game you cant put down, you spend hours on it because you want to see what happens in just one more turn, what you can accomplish. 5/5 id say for this game. i recommend it to anyone from every part of the gaming spectrum",30.3
"deep strategy, awesome community mods, awesome game overall 10/10",275.9

"you time travel with this game. started playing it and hours disappeared off the clock like they were minutes with the just one more turn mentality. super addiciting.",23.7
"such an amazing game that i thought i wouldnt like before i played it",131.5
"a great game but i highly recommend you also get the dlcs as this will improve your experience even more.",222.8

"what can possibly said about this game? you wanted to play for an hour or two after work to destress before bed? tough luck, your entire night is gone! i could never play for less than 3 hours at a stretch and it took a lot of self control to exit the game.",34.1
"ive certainly sunk enough of my time into this game. ive long been a fan of the civilization series, which has pretty much become the standard for turn-based strategy. this game brings a slightly more strategic approach to the classic civ gameplay, requiring that units occupy their own space. this makes grid movement much more important, as opposed to the enormous army stacks that the previous entries focused on. for those that are new to the civilization franchise, this game is not for those who want something they can pick up and play for an hour or two a day. its turn-based, so technically you can play it like that, but you probably wont. typically if i start a game at 2 in the afternoon, ill be finishing it up at 4 the next morning. so if youre prepared for that kind of commitment, i highly recommend it. :)",414.0
"awesome game careful tho you can end up playing all day",50.6
"great game, extremly addictive. this is a fun game which will run on the wrost of machines. it does have a few glitches but nothing you cant get past. super fun recomend to anyone.",100.3
"amazing game, really! spent so many hours saying just one more turn! ive lost countless hours to this and plenty more to come. keep up the great work firaxis!",104.2

"ive been playing the civs since version iii. though i dont play on-line (just for my own enjoyment) i really like these games. civ v carries on that tradition. at first i didnt care for it compared to civ iv, but after giving it a fair shot, i really like it and highly endorse it for those who enjoy these types of games. ;o)",256.6
"each game takes hours to master. especially if you set for large scale maps (i favor earth personally) and slow times with many players and city-states. i seem to have a problem completely taking over enemy capitals in war. ill deplete the entire health but it wont give me an option to make it into a puppet or anything. be prepared to spend days combating other players missionaries (man i hate islam..) and never trust gandhi. great music, good voiceovers. its a thinking-mans game and i give it a badass stamp of approval!",19.1
"at first i didnt think strategy games were the type of thing i would like, but i love this game. i would recommend this game to anybody. warning: you might be at your computer for a lot longer than you originally planned to if you play this game :)",32.8

"this is simply one of the simplest yet deepest strategy games ever. it deserves a spot in your library.",23.5
"civ v reminds me of one of those crazy german board games in the best way possible. there are some smart improvements in here for newcomers to the series and the hex grid system works perfectly but it never captured me in the same way civ iv did, its just a tad too clunky for my tastes. nevertheless civ v does everything right, if youre looking for an endlessly replayable strategic experience then you should look no further, civ v is the best in what it does.",86.9
"great mechanics with lots of replay value. any strategy fan will enjoy what civ v has to offer. the expansions also add lots of content.",25.4
"this game will consume a good chunk of your life. you will constantly find yourself itching for just one more turn and then the next thing you know, 3 days have gone by.",30.1
"by far the best of its genre, addicting as can be.",270.2
"india is directly north of england (me) and is constantly trying to slaughter me with guns and cannons while i crush their armies with swords, bows and catapults. 11/10",50.7
"kill gandhi, live another day. seriously,  gandhi.",117.5
"this game is one of the best... if not the best turn based strategy games out there... i have been big fan of civ 4... but now that i played civ 5 with all expansions (that brought a lot of fixes) i must say civ 5 is far better... espionage is fun, exploring, lot of different nations and ways of how to play... the game is fun and it is time sink for sure! but game has few downs: some bugs... and on harder playtroughs diplomacy becomes pain as its really easy to get on nerves of npcs and really hard to be good with them (that needs still fixing and balancing) and few ai fixes are needed too... not to mention how ai cheats a lot (having lot of money and being in minus with income, spawing extra military units etc...) only thing i havent tried out yet is multiplayer... but hope in time i will have fun with that too :) but anyway... really good game :)",449.7
"a game you can play and literally lose days at a time, then after 20 or so hours of gameplay and lose so its all been for nothing! fantastic game, if i ever get bored or have spare time on my hands, throw it on and watch the day disappear. easy enough to pick up as well, cant wait for next expansion..",81.2
"ing great game, better buy the complete edition and not be a bum like me.",87.5
"nice game if they would stop the  dlc system! make it free! only ask some money for big expansions. also make no expansion and expansion compatible in multiplayer!",102.4
"incredible depth and tactical gameplay, with its numerous difficulty levels this game will keep you coming back for more. just... one... more... turn...",154.2
"this is one of my favorite games. caution: extremly addicting.",619.2
"its an amazing game. the graphics are incredible. the actual running of the game is smooth, and it is a very strategic game. will you win by clture or domination? which civ will you play as? who will be your allies? my favourite steam game by a longshot",151.4
"kill that scumbag ghandi before he nukes you, trust me, he will. 10/10",336.9
"when trade stops mysteriously  everything and build an army",152.9

"11/10. one of the best games ive ever played, sid meier again makes a fabulous game. smooth gameplay and infinite replay value make it top notch! with more than a dozen awesome civs, and dlc that is very much worth the purchase, its a game i asbolutely love. cant wait for civilization: beyond earth!",281.1
"this is by far is the best most in depth strategy i have ever played. i would recommend it to any strategy fanatic out there, you can get sucked in to this game for eight hours at a time. i give a huge thumbs up.",954.5
"so i dont have very many hours on this but let me tell you something this game is a game that you buy if you want to do nothing except this in your free time. this game is even better when you have a friend and you can just screw him over for the fun of it. 20/10 would buy again except i have no monies.",51.6
"one of the most addicting games ive ver played! note to self: dont ever trust ghandi! 10/10",156.9
"this game has got to be one of the best turn based strategy games in the entire pc gaming universe. i recommend anyone to play this if they have time on their hands and like to have more strategy in gaming.",88.8
"not the greatest civ game i have played. not being able to stack units and the hexa-tiles sure makes things different from the previous games. you have to love civ to look past the flaws to enjoy all the beauty that is this game.",76.5
"extremely addictive game, loving the dlc that comes with it and also the many mods that have been created to go with it. many hours have been lost playing this.",537.2
"ahh, civ 5. ive ignored talking to my girlfriend so much because of this game and i love it 10/10",130.3
"this is a game that will entertain you and you will never want to stop. i recomend this to anyone who like openworld and the civilization series",39.6
"excellent game. 10/10 great graphics and everything!",84.1
"this is one of my favorite games to play, the realistic physics engine and amusing themes cast this game into one of the most difficult and fun strategy games ive ever played, especially now that they have added monetary constraints, the community development is superb and the game is constantly being updated and patched.",96.5
"the best civ game yet and the dlc improves the vanilla version dramatically. the one thing that has always bothered me about th civilization series is the diplomatic side of the game is very basic and would love to see some more depth. i love the new hexagon map layout and the replayability of this game is excellent.",482.3
"a fun turn-based strategy game where you can build your empire and conquer the globe. its very easy to use and will suck the hours away if you arent careful. be careful in the tutorial though, you cant save.",50.8
"excellent game! be sure to nuke france atleast once!",110.9
"i love this game and would highly recommend it, although it would be best to get the dlcs too as they add much more to the game.",283.7
"one of my favourite games, if not my favourite. 10/10 would nuke france whilst being ghandi the ruffless dictator.",315.9
"yes however, a lot of maniupulative online bugs have been found",301.6
"ive played them all (civ i through this one) and i like civ v the best *now* with the additional expansions. the hex-based map is much better for realistic environments and movement. single unit stacking is also much better - no more soak-off attacks (where you have a stack of spearmen with one modern armor and the enemy kills off your spearmen one at a time while your armor remains unharmed.) it also makes upgrading your military units important because now it matters if you are holding a mountain pass with a single legion versus using a rifleman unit. beyond combat there are a lot of nice additions with diplomacy, religion, and civics that give you more ways to play and win (replayability is very important to me.)",82.1
"really awesome turn-based strategy. better than the original, with awesome strategic and tactical options, and great graphics. it has less replay value than civ 4 though, as after a dozen games you will fully understand all the nuances, and the additional downloads offer little of interest for spicing things up.",473.8
"this game is loads of fun single player, and even more multiplayer. 10/10 would buy again.",42.5
"this game became my life i play it almost everyday. i highly recommend this game, but be prepared to cancel all other activities. this game will become your everything start easy then work your way up. prepare to lose yourself in this truly amazing game.",241.8
"hours of fun packed in a gorgeous setting. this requires dee strategy, and long hours.",254.4
"we shall be as gods, watching over our people. guiding them to new eras of peace and prosperity. then ghandi went and dropped a nuke on me, who even does that?",99.7
"awful game dont even bother, a complete total let down the turn based style is dull and very confusing. the grapics are ok at best the story is so ing dull. i wanted nothing and still felt let down.",3.3
"its a sid meier game so by saying that, you already know what you are going to get out of it such as hours on hours of gameplay that youll keep going back to year after year.",200.0
"an all time favorite. removing stacked units has really changed the strategy in this game compared to previous iterations.",566.8
"i bought and downloaded this game from your site and its glitching out constantly",452.8
"this is my favorite civ game, ever. each of the different leaders really has a distinctive playing style all their own, theyve added a culture bonus tree which is kind of like an mmo skill-tree, and now they indicate which things your advisors want you to build or research without having to talk to the advisors. the interface is very intuitive, the voice acting they added in some places gets me wicked pumped to play, and you dont have to wait for your culture to rise to acquire resources near a city.....if you have the dough you can just buy that hex. i am very glad i picked this up and if you like civ, you will love this game.",102.0
"some would argue that civ v dumbed things down from civ iv. i would argue the opposite - iv had overcomplicated the genre, and i think v has brought back the accessibility of the franchise, whilst stepping up the graphics and ai. one of my favourite games.",757.1
"**** this game. **** its bull**** options that are bull**** and do bull**** things. you want to play with a friend? you want to start in the same general area as your friend? while on a team? against all the other ai? hahahahahaha nope! our options here at civ 5 are bull**** lying trash and we **** in your faces. enjoy never being able to have the game you want, thanks for the money. 138 hours of reloading the game to try and get a spawn with a friend anywhere close while the option start together is selected vs emporer bots. nope! because here at 2k sports its in the game! as long as it isnt an actual options menu that matters!!! eat butt.",241.3
"ive played this game at least 20 times and never finished it. 10/10.",127.9
"if you have 10+ hours that you are willing to spend on one round of a game then this is for you.",114.2
"play this game if you like micromanaging numbers and the feeling of success when your numbers are higher than your opponents. the only non-numbers thing is positioning (of cities and units). and i suppose diplomacy. the gameplay is very good though. it has a moderately steep learning curve, but once you understand the mechanics and learn the costs of everything you will start to think more strategically and thats when it becomes fun.",45.6
"love the game, the graphics, and gameplay. its easy to play and fun. i give it a 5 star rating and a 10/10. anyone who loves strategy games will love this.",32.6
"i get a bsod every time i try to play it. its been working fine for about 6 months. ive logged over 120 hrs in the game. ran memory diagnostics, no issue. check disc was fine. uninstalled and reinstalled game 3 times, same issue. bsod. tried both direct x 9 and dx 10/11, same issue in both. tried running in windowed mode, same issue. the game is completely unplayable now.",162.3
"its the best i bet its better with dlc i havnt bought them yet but they must be good!!!!",52.7
"ace game tonnes of fun online and off if you havent got no internet and you wanna submerse yourself into your own world for a few hours (more like 8 hours)",40.1
"one of the most complete and advanced games in the world!",42.5
"some aspects are a bit dumbed down from civ iv, but the exansions will fix that and even exand on them. also combat is extremely improved, youll no longer lose attack helicopters to cavemen.",48.9
"most addicting games ive played yet. can play whenever you want. during when doing homework, work, etc. so far my most played game.",274.4
"i had never experienced being awake through the night until 5am. until i got civilization v. and despite my sore eyes the next day, no regrets.",112.7
"it wasnt worth the price i paid for it, but its still a great addition to the civ series.",10.7
"a good civilization game that changes/adds enough to the mix to also be its own particular experience. be advised that the two expansion packs (gods & kings and brave new world) are a must.",64.5
"not quite as good at civ iv in some aspects, worlds better than civ iv in others. im still a sucker for some empire earth or age of empires, but as for tbs games in general, civ v has a lot of moving parts, is a very involved game that can take days or a few short hours depending on rules, setup, and play style. good replay value. great with friends.",68.7
"this game is extremely fun and easy to get into. from bows and arrows to nuclear war, dirt roads to railroads and catapults to tanks, its fun to watch your civilzation progress. you almost feel a sense of pride watching your glorious empire rise and your enemies fall before you. you feel defeated and terrible if your grand civilaztion crumbles. this is just a great game to make your own story and alternate history. i reccomend this to everyone who likes creating your own story. 5 stars.",512.0
"this game is like crack, you always want a little more.",129.4
"good game overall, a bit repetitive at times but definitely fun to play!",139.4
"civilization v ranks in as my favorite pc game of all time, hands down. the depth, the strategy, and the amount of fun in this game while playing long matches that take several days just to complete is wonderful. there are so many countries to choose from and each have their own special stats and boosts. it takes a long time to be able to play at higher difficulties, but thats the beauty of it. the replayability is the highest of any game ive played. this is by far, a 10/10 game.",318.5
"so this game needs to be reviewed as it is one of the greatested experiences ive ever had in gaming. this game is smooth and true to the franchise in every way. the dlcs add and change so much they almost feel like a whole new game. civ 5 brings to the table a fantastic turnbased experience that i can sit down and play for hours. trial and error, new straegies, different paths you can take will completely changed how the game will turn out. smart ai adds to the games sense of running a real country in a real world. the single player on its own makes this game great but like many other games nothing beats playing it with a friend. if you have the money i reomend picking this game up with all its dlc its well worth a look.",198.2
"this is a great game. whether youre looking for a intense challenge, or just to unwind after work or school, this game will provide the experience you are looking for. i am not very good at strategy games, yet i have spent many hours enjoying the nuances of this game. the expansions add depth to the experience and there are many mods (my favorite being the song of ice and fire mod) which further add to the game. i would recommend this game to just about anyone.",390.9
"brilliant game. its an excellent time killer and its not hard to get a grasp of either. the diplomatic panel is smooth and pretty easy to use and the movement is basic but effective. 9.5/10",459.2

"a friend had told me about civilization for a while now, and i finally decided to pick it up during the summer sale. glad i did! civ is an awesome game so far and i literally instantly got hooked on it the first time i played. multiplayer is amazing so far even with just playing with one friend. awesome game!",140.6
"buy. this. game. i have over 400 hours invested into this game and it has not gotten boring yet. make sure you get the downloadable content with it. it makes a huge difference and brings all new and exciting ways to play to the table. you have to be careful when playing this game because you will start playing and bam next thing you know you have been playing for 6 hours straight. one of the best games i have ever bought. there is one con to this game. when playing online make sure you try and play with all human players so there are few or no ais playing with you. this is because for some reason the ais wont declare war on anyone while it is in online mode. they will in single player, just not online. honestly that is the only negative thing i have found about this game. word of advice, the zulus are s and mahatma gandhi is an even bigger . 9.5/10",431.4
"good game, spent hours playing it to death. no regrets. the ai is somewhat stupid but the difficulty settings make it quite the challenge. lots of replayability and great multiplayer to go along with it.",921.8

"civ 5 is very much differnt then the other civs in many smalls ways which makes it a big way. i personally love this game, its hard to seige a castle, but its not impossible, and can even be easy if you know how to do it. it can be as easy or as complicated as you want. as easy because it can all be done automatic and all you need to do is watch, to as complicated because you can micro manage everything, including where your citizens work. civ 5 has a play style for everyone who likes turn based simulations. from dominating everyone, to being the best in a curtain amount of time, to being great friends with everyone. i strongly recommend this game, and as a hint to winning. pick a way of winning and stick to it. there are many ways to win, and if you stick with one, you will win.",251.7
"an extremely addictive turn based strategy game that will keep you up all night for just one more turn. not for the average gamer however, as an average game takes around 6 hours :p",28.0

"the single player is weak, with less expansion and over all intelligence then previous civ titles. but the multiplayer is reasonably well put together. the game could handle some optimizing to run smoother, but overall its a fun title that adds a lot of new features to the series. get the full pack on a sale if you plan to buy it, its not worth the price of buying all the dlc seperately.",232.8

"it is like the best game. you guys gotta get it :d",94.1
"one of the best strategy games out there! theres plenty to like for fans of civ iv, but this game has reformed most of the major mechanics of that game, some for the better, some for the worse. if you like 4x games, this is definately a must play, but only if you have a lot of time to burn, multiplayer is especially addictive!",200.8
"a great addition to the civilization game family. very fun and creative in game play. totally worth the money.",100.5
"my great civilization was destroyed by the great warlord ghandi. 11/10 would play again.",33.0

"one of the best games ive ever played. it gets even better with mods.",89.8
"there is no better feeling than playing as gandhi and nuking your first city. i wish that everyone could feel what a rush it is to do such a thing. god bless america! 1776/2000",14.6
"for beginners, it is so complicated. many buildings, civilizations, leaders, units, policies and production to learn.",11.3
"this game is freaking amazing. get it. its kind of hard, very intense and strategic. but fun overall. great purchase.",398.5
"i really adore the civ series and civ 5 is no exception. very fun and there are so many ways to play. with all the expansions and the free dlcs the fun is endless",333.5
"i love this game it is all about human history featuring real charcters throughout history. be careful though dont get mixed up between what happends in the game and what happend in real life :) i reccomend this game because it gets complicated when you start but in the end its great fun and its all worth it.",360.2
"amazing strategy game. i have spent countless hours in this addicting turn based game.",157.4
"civ v just feels lacking for some reason, particularly compared to civ iii. cant really put my finger on it but it just feels like civ for those that dont want to really learn a complicated game. 6/10.",39.7
"love it! i have played sid meiers civ since the board game! it seems to just get better and better",737.7
"frustrating when you lose. glorious when you win. fun either way. buy it.",33.2
"this is a fun game and a great game that ive wasted many hours of my life life on. i definitly reccomend you to be friends with england though cause she whill #### you up if you dont.",92.7
"fun game. lots of different options keep it different every time.",450.9

"when people discuss whether games are art or not, this is the answer.",798.8
"a highly interlectual game with many qualites love the many victorys and the gameplay just a brilliant game and i certanly recomend anyone to play it",318.3
"one of the most engaging and fun strategy games ive ever played. although, not quite as mechanically interesting or deep or as the previous game in the series (civilization iv, my personal favorite), it still manages to steal hours of your time. highly recommended.",46.4
"an absolutely amazing turn based strategy game, where you play as a civilization out of the ones available ( the more expansions, the more civs) choose a world type which can be even based on the world itself and work your way up to a modern day of life and even the future. you can go to war or be buddies with everyone. but you must always be prepared in this highly addicting game",112.5
"one of the best games rts games out right now. consistent dlc and steam market make the game even better!",165.1
"this is an amazing game with some good graphics for sure i really like the way you have to think about where you are going to place your new city because if you place it where there isnt food it is going to starve but if you place it near multiple resources than you are in good luck. when you want to have a good time and you have nothing else to do, then play civ 5 this makes my top 10 great games list the only thing the game doesnt do very good is that it seems you cant ever get the ai to make a declaration of friendship you just have to wait for them to ask you. anyways amazing, amazing game definitely recommended",103.5
"one of my favorite games! i will always recommend this game to anyone who has played the civ games before!",75.4
"if you are a fan of empire builders, or have been addicted to civ in the past - this is a fine rendition of the series. just keep in mind, they are looking to change a bit from previous games, and there are some shockers - like the removal of stacking units - that can be a blow to peoples strategy. still a well done game that even plays good on the mac - just update to snow leopard first (or it wont run).",51.8
"civilization v is one of my favorite games i have on my computer. its like creating your own history. da is good :)",486.2
"its a great game to change history. wish rome was still around? play as augustus caesar and rule the world. wish carthage hadnt fallen to rome? re-fight the punic wars. just like nuking everyone into radioactive particles? go ahead, but dont expect to be popular...",498.6
"really good game if you like the idea of bulding a country the way you want it to be, even alot more fun with friends.",319.6
"civ v is a really fantastic game to play with your friends. the single player, though, is good at first to learn the ropes but you will become bored of it after the first few games. this is probably because the amount of fun you have with your friends in the game is in sharp contrast with the amount fun the single player is. if you have friends that have or want this game then get it. if not then i would recomend waiting for a discount or price drop.",118.9
"amazing! pure beauty of the graphics got me into this and the lovely gameplay got me playing more and more... you seem to lose sense of time playing civ ... that is so true :d i recommend this to all history, strategy and turn-base fans!",120.3
"so addictive, its like crack covered krispy kremes",87.9
"this is an awesome game to pick up if you enjoy strategy, planning ahead, and control. you first pick your nation (rome, russia, america, greece, persia, etc.) which all have perks. then you start controlling your own empire. the goal is to win. how do you do that? its all up to you on how to want to complete the 1 of the 5 goals to win. this game will have you playing it for hours. 10/10 p.s. never trust ghandi",193.4
"this is one of the best games i have ever played. if you like strategy then you should definately buy this game.",188.8
"one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever played a must have if you play pc games",34.8
"have poured so many hours of my life into this game, definatley reccomend getting this game",613.1
"to be honest i dont think ive ever been more absorbed by a game in my entire life. dont think that you need to be amazing at strat games to enjoy this one, this is my first civ game and the games tutorial system is extremely helpful without being annoying. it does a wonderful job of bringing you along in a way that just keeps you coming back for more. i advise setting some kind of alarm when you play this one though, this game is the closest the human race has come to building a time machine. buy this game, stop reading reviews and buy it.",127.6
"dont even think of one quick game before going to sleep, youre going to regret it..",46.5
"hours upon hours of fun! i love this game and cant wait for the next franchise!",107.5
"so, so fun! great single player game. if you love stratergy, and you love games with a layed back casual, fun play stile. you will love it. i mainly play online games, but this swayed me away from online gaming for a long time! must buy... awsome.",93.9
"this game is amazing, i never played the old civilization games, but when it comes to turn based games this is definetly one of the best, the graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack is just great, it really fits whatever situation you are in, all in all this game really makes you think",69.6
"stays true to the series, a worthy new title in the civ lineup.",319.7
"fun game to make you think, but you can get lost in the game and time flies by.",297.8
"fun mods and really long games that you always have something to do. and multiplayer can be great, but without your friends having it, playing with random people can be boring or anoying. main problem is that its not that stable with mods and will crash so save often. look at the dlcs too, because you may think somethings in the base game that isnt like trade routes or religion. to get the completed game costs alot",101.4
"this game makies the hours you are playing it seem like minutes",1004.4
"gandhi was my friend the whole game; then he nuked me for no reason 10/10",675.4
"got this in the humble bundle. all ive got to say is: great graphics, dont need a top level computer to play, and has very different gameplay than most strategy games. only played for 3.4 hours but no bugs seen so far. 10/10",31.7
"probably one of the best stradegy games ive ever played. i recommend this game, but i warn you its only half as good as it can be without the gods and kings expansion, and the brave new world expansion. so, if you plan to get a full experience from this game you should purchase the complete edition. being a tun based this is for people who like to plan out stradegies, and out wit your foes. i also find that many who just want to play a casual game will also like this stradegy game due to its turn based nature you can enjoy a relaxing game. it also offers a strong multiplayer with many customization options. i would recommaend this game to most gamers 9/10 would buy again ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- jollywatson",245.9
"great game, endless replay value, i always come back to it",314.0
"this is a very good game if you like turn-based strategy. very much worth the $50 for all the dlc.",822.6
"have you ever sat down and wondered i want a game where all you have to do is make sandwiches for cats? well then you came to the wrong place, because this game will take you on a journey where every turn is a new adventure. you can destroy nations, launch nukes, make cats sandwiche- wait......... no, yeah thats right. so i recomend you pick up this game as soon as you can 2/10 would play again.",20.7
"poassibly the most addicting game that exists. easy to learn, difficult to master. this edition of sid meiers franchise is the new standard for turn-based strategy.",322.6
"this game tears family and friend apart. i started a game with my friends and by the end everyone had betrayed each other, bonds broken, friendships destroyed. 10/10",75.1
"very fun. you will easily rack up hours on this tbs. friendly to beginners. gods and kings and brave new world are almost mandatory if you want to use mods from the workshop. there is too much dlc, but the core game should keep you happy for hours and the big expansions (gods and kings, for example) are actually substantial.",114.4
"i loved all the civ games but civ 5 and its expansions have really brought new depth and strategy to the genre. my only complaint is how quickly the ai will turn from friend to foe...but then again maybe thats how real politics work. 10/10",478.7
"really love this game so addicting and so much fun be requires the brave new world expansion pack",247.9
"i have 77 hours played on this game and ive probably played no more than 10 games",80.9
"great game, highly addictive, strategical and competitive. the obly con are the laoding screens= too long :/ overall one of my best games i own :)",92.5
"you start with little and keep playing one more turn to unlock that new tech that no other player has, or one more turn to strategize a a siege against the other civs. then you realize its been a hour. ok well just a little more. one hour turns to three then five. great game.",68.7
"great game. very addicting. the game should be called sid meiers civilization 5am oh god work starts in two hours it was 9pm 15 minutes ago!",856.3
"this game is just amazing and the dlc makes the game even more enjoyable",90.3
"if you like stragety games then this is a good 1 because if you wanna conquer land like the romans then go ahead",82.0
"its a really fun game that stimulates the strategy part of the mind and teaches you a bit of history at the same time =d",119.8
"endless hours of entertainment (for the patient). multiplayer that will have your friends at eachothers throats. scenarios for the less creative of us. mods. need i say more? i will though. this game nearly made me fail my first year of university. 10/10",619.2
"good if the game wouldnt bug out every time i have to launch it",8.3
"if you have 8 hours to kill, this is the game for you. protip: never trust ghandi.",115.6
"if you have a few years to spare this game is perfect :d",126.8
"tenouttaten highly recommend not a fan of strat games myself but this game is fun i played it for 2 days straight got one of the worst nose bleeds of my life passed out for 15 mins and woke up being weld to the ambulance turns out i was dehydrated but thats not important the point is this game is awesome itd make yo momma say dammit kyle youre going to kill yourself playing these video games nonstop you need to sleep! highly recommended",107.1
"i gotta say if youre married this is a really good game to get your spouse into! great for couples!",54.2
"classic game, can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? 8/10",265.4
"i like this game beasase it includs lot of stratagy. it feels like you are aculy runing a governmen in acent times. the trading in the game is epic you can creat friend ship with coumputer controlled peaple or with real peaple. for the cunclshonh you should buy this game.",43.0
"really good strategy game! i recommend it to those of you who strategy games and who like ancient civ",429.8
"highly reccomend this game to anybody who loved 4x games.",97.9
"one of the best games ive played! i highly recommend it!!",665.7
"havent played it much, i need brac  dlc to play with nick and collins... what the  i buy the game 5 dollars 6 years ago dont know hwo to play why did i eeven install it? 14/14 - its alright",15.3
"this isnt game dosnt have the highest played hours in my library for nothing... well maybe its that the game takes days and sometimes weeks to complete... but with infinite play through possibilities its a game one could play constantly... :)",602.1
"this game gave me trust issues. f*ck you, egypt and arabia! 10/10 would play again",27.2
"firstly and most importantly: i have never played a civ game before. secondly, the first time i sat down and played civilization v, i played for almost 8 hours. consecutively. the game is that addictive, and i havent had that kind of hook on a game for a while. there are many ways to play and ultimately be the best civilization. the game might look unappealing and boring to some, but the game is really easy to understand, yet extremely deep at the same time. im mostly a strategy/mircomanagement person, so take this game recommendation with a grain of salt.",103.7
"an improved hexagonal movement/combat system as well vastly improved graphics, a new interface, and a diverse technology tree makes this a worthy entry in the civilization series. its not terribly different from previous titles, but the improvements made are welcome, and its just as addictive as ever.",94.4
"strategy at its finest. be the culture that inspires the world, the warmonger that crushes anyone underfoot, be a diplomat and prove that pen is indeed mightier than the sword, be scientific and nuke the world leaving nothing but soot. many ways to win and so many different civilizations and leaders that history fans will grin and swoon for their favorites, and for the rest of us, theres building the pyramids in japan as the mayans while you make war with egypt. yeah, history is great.",57.4
"like turn-based strategy games but had enough of those old and  graphics? get civ v. plays as awesome as civ iii!",33.6
"on the one hand, the hex grid layout is an improvement, though i dont think its a huge one. cities having their own defenses is also a nice update, and makes a lot of sense: cities in this game really ought to have static defenses. ranged attack units attacking at, you know, long range is also a bonus. that said, i think combat has, overall, taken a huge step backwards. units cant stack. that means a combined arms approach is much harder, and the amount of space an army takes up is actually less realistic: really? a unit of spearmen takes up as much ground space as an entire city? for all its flaws, i think civ:ctp was the only one of the series to get land combat right. as a final note, this is the first civ game where ive ever said ill just play one more turn and actually followed through. draw whatever conclusions you will from that.",319.1
"very good but i reccomend you get the collection pack with it as it gets fairly old after a few hours with no dlc",59.8
"the civ series is now more in depth than it ever was. i love it",88.9
"absolutely brilliant game. solid mechanics, great civ variation, and a good introduction into strategy games. often leads to some rather fun and interesting games. easy to learn, hard to master, even harder to not enjoy. 10/10",585.6
"wake up every morning at 10 oclock at night, half an hour before going to bed drink a cup of sulpheric acid play civ v 29 hours a day *insert city* wants whales *insert leader* denounces me *insert city* wants whales *insert leader* attacks me for no reason *insert city* wants whales gandhi nukes me leave the world on a spaceship/kill everyone/build a perfect society/wait until doomsday repeat 10/10",252.1
"if you have any interest in strategy games, you probably already have it and a couple of its predecessors. otherwise, buy it and your only regret will be that the wife left you, got the house and the kids. but hey, chances are you wont notice anyway.",914.8
"best civilization so far. improves in almost every way.",159.9
"super gameplay, a lot of replayability and all the goodies from later civs. great game.",222.2
"really good game, love it, maybe it would be cool with religious victory, but super aweseome one of my favourite games ever!",186.8
"few games offer the satisfaction of raining nuclear fire on your friends pwetty touwist city. *continuation of friendship not guaranteed*",679.7
"amazing game! very girpping and doesnt get boring at all. if you a are a statergy gamer who loves to play a game a different way each time - civ 5 is for you. civ 5 is very dynamic and no game ever plays the same way which is easily the most thrilling thing. if singleplayer isnt exciting enough for you then mulit-player will blow your mind. anything could happen, your empire could crumble in a few minutes or soar and destroy all other civilisations instead! a must need game for stratergy gamers!",29.9
"fantastic fun, but be warned; its very easy to still be playing 2 hours after youd planned to stop.",30.6
"if you love em you love em, if you hate em you hate em. they are what they are. civ v is no disappointment as a successor to the series.",237.1
"with the release of brave new world, the mecahincs of civ v finally feel reasonably streamlined. always something to build, lots of ways to achieve victory, and culture and tourism really feel like epic options to pursue. i would have to recommend getting both expansions to get the most comprehensive experience. the map and civ packs are also great additions, as each has radically different civs to try. theres a civ for every playstyle",107.6
"very cool game, ive played about 10 hours worth and still have no clue what im doing, looking forward to seeing what i can do though :d",15.6
"its a great game i was wanting to get it after i watched one of my favorit youtubers play",56.6
"no matter what you do, never trust ghandi!!!!!!!also, every once-in-a-while, check your clock, cause it probbably been a couple days since you started playing. 20/10",44.2
"just like in real life people in this game seem to instantly dislike me and want nothing to do with me. anyway this game is still enjoyable, unlike real life.",64.0
"fantastic game. like you should buy it just because i say so.",21.5
"buy this game if you have nothing to live for and you want to ruin your life",63.0
"best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr~ needs more optimization for really  computers... im tired of playing in strategic mode.",79.1
"this game is amazing. all the civilizations are great and the game provides endless fun because you never really need to stop playing a world.",117.5
"great! i dont think ill ever know everything there is to know about this game! i highly recommed it!",55.3
"this game makes my manties moist. if you dont own this, castrate yourself.",535.4
"one of those games thatll turn 5 minutes into 5 hours and will have you always questioning what ghandi is really doing and dead certain that songhai will always betray you. its easiest to just wipe them all out. always go for the overlord victory.",171.4
"one of my favorite games of all time. i have loved the franchise since i first started playing civ 3, and have not found another love since. it is one of the best strategy games of all time, and with additions of brave new world it has become and even more accurate representation of the world.",678.5
"a great game to test your strategy and political capabilities. there are some mechanics in the game that i disagree with and feel that ruin the immersion a little, however it is overall a great game. i also originally disliked the decision to switch over to a hex system, however it is something i have adjusted to and now, even like. now if only i could stack my armies of units onto the same space like the older ones :)",45.6
"good strategetic game wished for more action like age of empires or mythology so faster war and results.",62.2
"i enjoy the game. but i cannot get any tech support from steam. now when i try to start the game i get an immediate steam error: missing executable. i have followed the suggested guideline for correcting this, but it did not work. i have e-mailed steam twice and have waited 5 days since my first call for help. i would appreciate some type of assistance with this.. if onw cannot acquire tech suppport, i guess you need to consdier whether you should purchase games from steam. if anyone can asssist me pleas send email to",588.3
"got raided by barbarians, got to silence attilla the hun, removed england from this universe, nuked gandi back to the stone age, i recommend this game",65.1
"just like all the rest of the civ series this is an amazing and addictive game. new dlcs give you the ability to host a wold council and make global decision. this is probably their best game yet.",162.3
"hands down the best strategy game in existence. there is literally nothing wrong with it in any way, shape, or form, and it is superb. id say if you like games like halo wars, the total war series, or any military/war game, then you should get civ 5. and if you do, i strongly reccommend getting the dlc. best purchase ive ever made (just look at how long ive played it)!",63.8
"forget sleep. sid meiers civilization v is what you need.",91.0
"great game overall, learning curve might be a little challenging but once you overcome that, you will spend hours upon hours on this game... 9/10 its okay",369.5
"great game! its really satisfying going from the early beginning ages to the futuristic ages. definitely dont start a new game before bed.",16.7
"amazing. needs the expansions to really shine in the endgame.",31.6
"pretty decent, if your a civ 4 fan with all the expansion packs then this game will suck in comparison. no spies, no religion, no icbm. but once you get past that its unique enough to play for a while.",249.8
"been playing this since civ i and this reiteration is just as fun as the first time i stayed up for two days straight playing i. great game for hardcore gamers and noobs alike. great gf/wifey game too!",264.4
"sid meiers civilization v is a strategy game where you can play as many different empires ranging from rome, to the united states. the goal is to become the best civilization through domination, having your culture overthrow evryone elses, building a rocket, and many more ways to win. plus, there are many fun scenarios in the game! wanna play as the union in the american civil war, or the confederate states? do you try to prevent rome from falling in the fall of rome scenario, or try to take some if it? there are so many possible stories you can make up about your game too! just one more thing... never trust gandhi! give it a try!!!",192.0
"civ is like kill everyone, build city, and dont let no one kill my peeps or i will cry",85.3
"0/10 you cant quik scope and my aim bot didnt work",689.9
"if you havent bought this game you dont know mindbending challenge beyond comprhension in a turn base strategy if you have its excessively great right.",62.6
"this game is fantastic, and i love it. 4/5 for me. one problem though. literally 90% of the workshop items require the dlc brave new world. this is an extra 30 dollars. dont get it if you want mods, but dont want to spend an extra $30. other than that, fantastc game",134.9
"turn based time suck that is the de facto standard. this game is highly addictive and impossible to put away.",112.9
"huge time-vampire. worth every minute though- its still fun, challenging, and mentally stimulating. my 95 hours is about 5 whole games on the fast-paced setting. this is the game you play when you want a week of your life to disappear suddenly. its easy to learn, but hard to master- especially with the all additions to mechanics the expansions make. again, 95 hours, no where near mastery myself. i reccommend that you get both gods and kings and brave new world- without them, the game is a little lacking.",105.1
"after playing civilization revolution a few years ago, i thought it was the best thing in the universe. however, i was not aware of its beng a series. as such, when i walked through wallmart and saw this, i lost my . (not literaly of course) if youre thinking about buying this game, while it is amazing, civilization beyond earth is about to come out! just get that! ohhhh! i cant wait! goodbye life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",229.6
"i love this game. i play it with my wife all the time and i can say it has strengthened my marrige! the couple that plays together, stays together. :)",849.5
"fantastic game the dlc makes it even better very worthwhile. it requires a lot of thinking especially at higher difficulty. there are some great mods for the game in the steam workshop and it is probably my favourite game of all time. i have put more than 500 hours into the game so far and am still playing.",706.2
"very fun, and time consuming game, easy for new civilization players. the only downside is once you start to know your way around the game you see how simple the ai is.",43.9
"anyone into stratagy games should really check this one out. a++",229.7
"wery good game but europe universal is much bether",14.2
"you can spend hours playing this game and never feel time pass. its pretty cool",519.9
"there is a lot to this game and unless you care any bit for a strategy game i would not suggest this game to you. it can be fun, there are a lot of different modes and a ton of different choices in this game. it takes awhile to get to understand. there are tutorials to help you understand the game and get better at it but you can still play the game, not have any idea of what your doing, and still get somewhere in it. i would know ;o.",41.5
"its like age of empires meets risk, its just amazing and i cant stop ing playing it.",181.9
"i dont normally play strategy based games, because i dont like the pace or the game play all that much; but i really enjoy this one. the historical accuracy of military units makes me pleased that there was ample research put into the background of the game, and it is also pretty fun that you can win in a variety of ways if you dont want to just focus on having a military. it makes it a more diverse game with lots of replay fun, imo. :)",325.3
"should do a fun mod.. make the barbarians zombies ..",423.9
"it is really really fun. i got it not really knowing what it truly was. i just wanted to make the 2k sale worth it. but when i started playing, i was immediately entranced. i recomend it to not only fans, but everyone.",45.2
"great game. ive been a civ fan for a while, and i wasnt dissapointed with civ 5. the ai i a little screwy, but it doesnt take away from the game.",133.5
"definitely the best civ game thus far; the combat element is far more tactical when you are restricted to a single unit per tile and dont just end up with a stack of trebuchets like in previous releases. as always, there is a good spread of difficulties to play on, and you should be able to find one to suit you that is sufficiently hard to win against without seeming impossible.",200.4
"i swear time ceases to exist as i play this game. whether you are crushing sparta with the legions of rome, or using the advanced technological knowledge of babylon to send a rocket in to space, you will love the epic that is civilization v.",245.1
"this game is addictive in singleplayer and delightful in multiplayer. 10 conquered civilizations out of 10, would buy again.",54.5
"love this game. at first it got boring after a few minutes of gameplay but upon learning the core of the gameplay and strategies, this is one addicting game.",277.5
"having played all the civilization titles from the start, including the spinoffs, i definitely will say i have enjoyed civ v the most. many of the questionable mechanics have been refined, and playing militarily actually takes strategy as opposed to unit spamming.",166.2
"just started playing but i really dig it already. little slow paced at first but it picks up steam fast!",113.0
"this  pretty tight its like an asian girl with big boobs just very suprising and underrated",357.1

"hands down one of the best turn based strategy game imo.",102.5
"i just bought this game and finding it very difficult to work out how to upload expansion packs? ............. why is this so bl;oody hard ?? please help .......",858.1
"such an awesome game! i never really liked strategies such as warcraft 3 or red alert, but this just opened my eyes...it is so massive and there is so much to do. unlimited replayability (or at least there about) and it is tons of fun.",138.3
"nice in-deph turn based stratey game only a few texture bugs here and there but it doesnt affect gameplay high recommended",37.9

"good classic game, but there are too many bugs in multiplayer.",275.9
"this game provides an amazing experience for fans of strategy games and empire management. if you purchase the base game, also purchase brave new world, and gods and kings, if you can afford it. the rest of the dlc is also worth the price. the game is so replayable that it justifies the price.",733.9
"super!! really nice and smooth gameplay. one of the best civilization games atm, its not too difficult and the mods are pretty awesome. i play it nowadays with several mods and having a lot fun playing it when i do. so yes i would recommend this game to the gamers that are interested in it.",92.6
"i highly recommend this game because it is fun for all the family. it is a great game to play with your children as it helps them learn about history. also, how you advance through eras is very cool! you will get poon with this game! ~ mattwheeliebin",308.5
"amazing. everything! say goodbye to your life. say hello to your new one, in sid meiers civilization v!",140.4
"if you love turn based strategy this is a must own game. the only issue is the game software does not efficiently use the hardware of your system so you need some powerful hardware to play this game on top settings on the largest maps, especially during the late game the lag can become nearly unbearable.",896.5
"most complete and compelling game in the series, the add-ons and patches fixed just about anything i had to complian about over the years",211.5
"if you buy this, you will lose your sense of reality.this  is more attractive then drugs and trocadero combined!!!",150.0
"out of all the games that i have, this is the one that i keep coming back to everytime... outstanding game, great gameplay, the best user generated content, and unending combinations. if you even remotely like strategy, board games, or even just history, this is a must have.",612.2
"can play this game for years at a time, no pun intended. this game does take up so much time. well worth it.",245.4
"great game, worth every penny ive spent on it. not good if you enjopy having a social life.",394.9
"possible side effects for playing this game are: lost sense of time, sleep loss, convincing yourself for just one more turn, anger issues, trust issues, gandhi issues, believing you can be a good leader, complete loss of social life, mental and physical health loss, addiction, and possible hallucinations of hexagons.",305.0
"civ is the only franchise ive routinely played for nearly a quarter of a century. amazingly fun, educational, challenging and satisfying. nearly infinite options for variation and replay. most importantly, now available for those of us using steam on linux. the only problem is that i lose days at a time when i play through the longer scenarios. definitely worth $30 and a steal when on sale.",78.9

"this game blows. after decades of civ2-4 play, i tried over and over to get into this game. i couldnt. its civ in risk: the board game form. actually, id venture to say its less complex than risk. dont waste your time. its unfortunate im about 4 years too late on this one.",34.9
"i love this game! i am a huge history nut and being able to relieve great parts from history as great leaders was real good fun. i have the base civ 5 game & looking into getting the complete edition which incl. all dlcs and scenarios. this is the best game out of the civ. franchise by far! great fun & i cannot wait to play it with friends.",7.1
"this game is addicting. would be the 4 words that i would say if somebody asked me about this game. civilization v is probably the most fun ive had in a game. every turn, you move your units, manage your cities, interact with other civilizations, not knowing what awaits you next turn. you can become friends with the warmongering genghis khan, or piss off the peace loving gandhi. this game offers a ton of civs to play as, so youll be spending alot of time in it. also, if youre worried about getting demolished, dont worry, civ v offers a really good indepth tutorial made for getting beginners into the game. if you can get a good deal on this game or the ultimate edition, i really would recommend buying it, and prepare for getting your soul sucked in. 9/10.",343.9
"i pretty sure 90% of the hours ive put in have been on one single game... unit stacking needs to come back but besides that highly recommend.",64.1
"i made a succesfull 4th reich as bismark annihilating every civilisation ever and turning them into my slaves. best game ever. also, gandhi nuked me ;_;",37.3
"this is great it is 60 bucks but is worth it. you run your own empire through the ages where your millatary goes from clubs and spears to giant uraniam powered mechs and everything inbetween. just [if youve got 60 steam dollars]hit download and youll see what im talking about.",40.8
"i have played the game for 49 hours and i have enjoyed ever second of it creating my troops and when i can upgrading them to make them more powerful and conquering other nations. the graphic are great but you need a powerful grachics card to run the game better smoother and faster.",82.7
"get this if you want to waste 5+ hours in just one game :-)",446.2
"ive been playing games in the civilization franchise for a long time (since civ 2). this is a great version!",301.0
"civilization is a series i have probably put so many mindless hours into, by myself and with friends. the series is legendary and in my eyes the best strategy series in existance. the fifth entry has its ups and downs, but with gods and kings (the first expac) the game begins to match the scale as the third and fourth before it. balance is getting there and the overall changes it makes are superb. i love the hex tiles versus the square tiles of the first, and removing stacks is a very risky but rewarding move. overall it gets a 9.5/10. if you liked any previous civ pick this up but dont forget gods and kings.",228.7
"an rts that takes the major civilizations of earths history and puts them in a what if scenario. how would the huns fair if they were peaceful diplomatic people? or if ghandi was a horrible tyrannt? what if venice was in the desert? could they build a civilization to withstand the test of time?",84.5
"this game is so addictive. i suck at it and i still keep playing it. awesome game!",119.4
"its a great game to play with a friend.. besides the whole disconected after every turn for a 10 minute loading screen to restart the game",80.2
"fantastic game, super addicting. you start playing at 5 pm next thing you know it is 5 amand there is still more to do in the game. prepare to binge",48.4
"the base game is a little weak compared to civ 4. with both major pieces of dlc (gods and kings, brave new world) however, civ 5 is the best in the series. the playable civilisations are very varied, the diplomacy and faith systems are solid. city-states add an extra element of risk/reward and trade routes are very lucrative. multiple play styles are viable game winners and fun. the only real negative is the high cost of the dlc. overall the game is fantastic and offers huge replayability. a must have for fans of the civilization series and 4x strategy in general.",327.2
"this is by far the best tun-by-turn stratagy game i have ever play! get it asap!!!",92.9

"just wait until sid makes civilization beyond earth expansion pack.",330.4
"before playing sid meiers latest installation in the civilization series, my friends and i played civilization: revolution on console and had a blast with it. about a couple weeks ago, i scraped together enough cash to invest in civ 5. my first thought upon playing it was how deep the game really goes. land has to be cultivated, you have to have private meetings with other world leaders to cross into their land, and the people you watch over can praise or criticize your rule. my own example would be giving the leader of the aztecs a passport for trade in exchange for ivory to fuel my growing circus enterprise in boston. the cherry on top of all of this is that the game subliminally teaches you history, and what your characters did in real life that made them worthy of leading an entire empire. in short, if you dont have this, get it. now.",28.6

"just buy it if you havent, worth the money. get the expansions aswell, theyre amazing. as in the game itself, you spend countless hours with different civilzations that you can play as on different kinds of maps that you choose. theres a lot of types of victory; being science, culture, diplomatic, dominance, etc. theres different eras you progress through and with science you get new buildings, units, etc. i have spent a lot of hours into this game and im still not bored of it.",176.9

"the highly moddable nature of this game really adds considerably to the life of this game. tools are provided to allow users to do anything from adding new civiliations, to changing the ui, to changing game rules and ai behavior. definitely worth a look for anyone who is a fan of turn-based strategy.",504.7

"i wake up and look outside to see a great day.  i think i might go outside today. i say. but steam pops up on my desktop.  but look jake, my pc teases.  i have civ 5 up for you and only one more turn wouldnt hurt. i sit down and look at my screen and think  whats the worst thing that can happen? days later my finger sting from the blisters covering them. my steam feed says 420 hrs. in last week. i crawl to my bed and fall back asleep only to repeat the cycle again tommorow.",124.9
"its great for experimenting with civs by your self, but even better when you go up against friends.",140.2
"warning: this game has a tendency to try and consume your life. i must say i try to only play this game occasionally, reason being it sucks you in and doesnt let go, i have passed the 390 hour mark and still find myself saying just one more turn. if you like this type of strategy game you will not be disappointed and will gain a massive time sink in your life, p.s, dont trust ghandi!",477.6

"the most amazing game yet from the sid meiers civ series! must buy for any gamer.",9.9
"to be honest, i would recommend buying this game if you dont have exams coming up. i am speaking from experience here as my friend and i spent almost an entire weekend playing co-op. the addictiveness is incredible, as i just want to play just one more turn, and of course at the end of that turn, war begins or you complete a world wonder or you complete your nuclear missile that ou were planning to fire against amsterdam. in other words i thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it almost 100%. 92/100",74.7
"when will this go onto offer got so many friend wanting it but wont buy it until its gos on offer overall tho, bloody good game !",95.4
"loved this game, always just wanting that one more turn before you quit. even the vanilla game itself is expansive, immersive, and has tons of content. i have yet to get bored of the base game, as there is so many different ways to play this game, whether its to gain a culture victory, science victory, diplomatic victory, or domination victory; all these types are exciting and intuitive to play! i would recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy games",101.1
"time sink. hella fun. bought it from amazon for much cheaper, used the key from there to download in steam. get it, its fun.",17.1
"fabulous game! 10/10. tip: declaring war then making peace will lead to a denouncement the following turn. [betrayal als!]",259.3

"the only game i have ever played where i dont want to kill everyone immediately.",55.3
"civilization 5 is the ultimate strategy game. it not only combines strategic warfare and combat sytems in times of war but also the complexity of ruling a sprawling empire in times of peace. as you navigate through diplomacy, maintaining happiness, science, city output, wealth, and a slew of other concepts in this game that make it one of the hardest games to achieve mastery on. spending countless hours on your regular game grinding and laboring to get to some precipice of achievement is nothing short of an average game. civilization brings strategy gaming into a whole new light making each and every game a challenging exercise of the mind to outhink and outsmart your opponents whether it be ai or friends. all in all, this game deserves every recognition as it is truly a fantastic and intriguing game.",506.1
"i made a religion with the jewish star and called it communism. 10/11 would reccomend.",68.5
"latest expansion pack, gods and kings, definitely makes this the civ game i was hoping for.",66.3
"great game. makes you think. lets you have fun. i recommend this game for anybody who likes strategic games, anybody in general. even if you dont like strategic games, at least give this game a couple goes.",12.0
"one of the best strategy/turn based games ever. it is complex at first, but it truly shines once you grasp all of its mechanics. additionally, the expansions add needed depth in combat, diplomacy and trade. brave new world improves the gameplay significantly whereas gods and kings did not add much to the game.",146.9
"best played with your friends. great game...definatly recommend.",78.1
"civilization 5 is very time consuming, but a fun game even the less. i can recommend this game to people who like strategy games based on board games like risk. there is not as much action as in other strategy games, but theyve improved the combat part since the last game.",43.5
"this game sucks the hours from my life, similar to that of the machine from the princess bride. anybody want a peanut?",189.9
"it is fun to build a civilisation from the ground up even with out the dlc 10/10",112.4
"i like it but every time i play, i just wants me to play age of empires more.",86.3
"a nice game, but i prefer civ 4 for several reasons: - diplomacy in civ 5 uninteresting; its too simple and doesnt play an integral part of the game. - there is a lot of places where micromanagement is beneficial (probably more places then in civ 4), but it is often hidden and has a cumbersome interface. one example is the assignment of tiles that a city works. even the prioritize production etc. choices dont always choose the best placements (f.ex. when building a settler). - combat is obviously very different, but also an interesting change, however a small map can become too crowded making movement almost impossible.",558.2
"this game lets you play as jah and start a religion called rastafarianism. i dont smoke ganja but if i did i would probably like this a lot more.",14.8
"this was hard at first but is still a very great game its a very different rts for those strategy lovers out there",99.5
"sid meiers civilization is the perfect fix for anyone who loves a strategy game. v is just better and more refined than its younger bretheren. it is totally worth the buy, though it must be said, that if you havent heard of civ before this review than you must be a damn barbarian.",187.8
"absolute classic of a game. i have been playing since civilization since i was a young kid and each instalement has been highly enjoyable. a very in depth strategy game that you will gladly spend many hours playing. there are always a few negatives however, i feel the game can become quite boring half way through once most of the primary resources are taken (unless you are at war).",333.5
"amazing game 10/10 but could add more dlc expansion packs",152.6
"on my first playthrough, i got to play as washington. i got the opportunity to liberate the indians with freedom and nuke japan. 11/10 would murica again.",107.3
"one more turn... one more turn... civilization is the pinnacle of turn-based strategy gaming (arguably challenged only by its branch-off game, sid meiers alpha centauri), and civ v brings many improvements (and streamlining) to the series. well worth it, but beware: saying that this game can consume your soul is not an exageration. youll easily spend many hours in a row playing this without even noticing.",22.5
"this game is very fun but beware it will take a lot of free time away from you its fun even if you dont buy the dlcs it requires thinking but not a lot of it theres so many cool little things to expirament with and with the steam workshop it so easy to mod just click a button and bam you have a mod 100% worth the investment proably has over 1000 hours of game play alone than another 1000 with the dlcs all it takes is a few practices games and maybe watching a tutorial on youtube and then before you now youll be playing like a pro.",588.2

"stop reading these reveiws and buy this game now!!!!!!! its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",76.7
"as a poor guy, i tend to make sure all my purchases are durable. anything i put money into should theoretically last me as long as possible. i bought this game in the summer sale two years ago, and after many hours of playing, i can assure you, civ 5 is a durable game. i love replay value and, in my humble opinion, this game has replay value in spades. i have taken long breaks, but thankfully firaxis has been good about dlc and updates to keep the game fresh and me coming back. i love this game.",266.7
"great game. you play for seven hours, lose miserably, then come back instantly with a new sure-fire strategy to beat the pesky ai. best strategy game imo",44.7
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played. limitless possibility for victory based on tech rushing, militarisitic expansion, trade, cultural influence and more. some might complain about being turn-based, but i personally enjoy it much more than any rts ive ever played, including starcraft ii.",126.2
"watch before your very eyes as entire day vanishes whilst you give gandhis swarm of knights a nuclear suppository.",171.1
"personally i am a huge history buff and yet i had never played any of the civilization games. i purchased it skeptically (after purchasing microsofts similar game) and was blown away with civilization. if your into history, great game play and fresh expansions (with a decent steam community behind it) - get this game!",24.9
"no other game quite matches civilization for the level of revilement and repulsion instilled in my partner whenever i play it. i say, one more turn, aware of the damage my lies will cause. she will say, ill leave you! ill call her bluff and hold out my non-dominant hand, looking away from the screen only between turns. shell plead, at least eat something! ill devour whatever meagre portion of food she gives me. assignments become secondary. work becomes secondary. life becomes secondary. holding your bladder for 15 straight hours isnt normal, on civilization it is. 10/10 would destroy life again.",316.5
"i really wish they would fix and/or fine tune some of the things that have been annoyances since the beginning of the series. like some seemingly minor, but incredibly frustrating, ai issues for example. but still, great game. 9/10.",172.6
"not the best civ game ever made but who doesnt like ruling the world???",77.0
"definitely the best game in the civilization franchise. and one of the best turn-based games ever. highly recommend, and i cant wait for civilization: beyond earth!",11.7
"addictive doesnt begin to cover this game, especially if youre playing with friends. the amount of time youll accidently spend simply by losing track of time is astonishing. worth every hour.",206.3
"i love this game, i love the new things you can do but also a little sad to see some of the old features removed.",76.7
"great game for stratagy fans, the base game is good but it is musch better with expansion packs. i think it is well worth buying and would reccomend it to anyone.",162.2

"just  consul montezuma of the aztics . never. trust. that. son of a . this is what this game will do to you. rivalry will be brought up . its such a good game that gets on my nerves. oh and dont ever play this game before going to bed. its one of those games that you will never get tired of. oh and if youre planning to get this, get the dlc packs as well, its worth it. just get the complete edition. its 100 percent worth it. you may get lost at the beginning , since there are a lot of stuff to go through before you get your civ ready to go. definitely worth the 30$.",19.1
"steam workshop makes it a whole new gae, i recommend getting the complete edition and downloading some mods, r.e.d is a good one.",244.8

"very fun turn based game. if your in to that sort of thing then its a must have",139.3
"ive never played a game as much as this- except for maybe wow. it is an engaging, fun strategy game where decisions you make from turn 1 have repercussions at turn 500. whether or not you play with or against friends or against ai, its an incredibly fun experience and a must-have for any fan of strategy games. i cant recommend it enough. the only problem i have is the piecemeal dlc. why cant they bundle all the dlc civs into one cheap pack? not to mention i dont think ive ever seen non-expansion dlc on sale...",701.4
"this is probably the greatest game ever conceived by man. it draws you in, enticing you with a varity of choices, takes your hours from you, and wispheres into your ear one. more. turn. you realize that the night has passed when the sun glints through the window and you decide to adjourn from the game, but your mind never leaves it. you are always thinking of you next move, your next turn. you are an immortal authorian leader of a country, yet you are benevolent, you look to make your people happy thourgh the centuries and always looking for you next conquest, be it scientific, cultural, or by military. this game doesnt just define hexagonal-based strategy games, it defines you.",123.1
"a great strategy game. i have played this game constantly since i bought it, and have loved it. the dlc expansions add a whole new life to the game, and even without it is fun. be prepared for long games though if doing multiplayer, they can last for 3 hours+.",136.0
"great time killer. very easy to learn, i picked the basics up quickly, but you can go much deeper into the strategy of it.",378.9
"civilization v is a well-crafted game of domestic, international, and military balancing of power. you create an empire from the sands using your decisions on which race to how large you will grow, and where you will grow. your empire is shape by yourself and by your neighbors. the tech tree and military units allow you time to become use to every changing battlefield conditions which happen naturally over the course of time (using knight then cannons) as a caveat i will say playing this game you will lose hours of your time and not know where they went, but end that time feeling satisfied.",209.9
"had this game for a while, a long while, but ive never sat down and written a review for it. until now. if you like turn-based games, then you will love this game. its not as in-depth as it could be, but it is fantastic all the same. get the complete edition, vanilla is ok but each expansion pack does a lot to make it even better. take it from a guy who has spent almost a month of his life playing this game, civ v was and is the best purchase i have ever made. one final thing, the ai in this game is not all that great, but i think its still playable in singelplayer.but the game is easily one of the most addicting games i have ever played, so word of warning: this game will consume your life. you have been warned.",879.3
"like turn-based strategy? like age of empires? then this game is for you! its a fun game, even though the ai is a bit off at times, but that wont interfere with the gameplay. with the challenges, there are many different ways you could play, and win. you may declare war on everyone and go for a domination victory, or you can gather enough science to build a spaceship and go for a science victory. its a fun game, and it gets an 8/10.",158.6
"this game is great to relax and play after a long day. i really didnt think i would like it, but after giving it a try i am having a blast. this game is very easy to mod and customize to your liking. i definitely recommend this game.",24.4
"this is a great game. is a good starting point for anyone who wants to play a 4x game. it can be simple. but as you start to gain more experience with the game you start learning how much is acutally going on within the game. it is a great single player game and a great multiplayer game. i have had tons of fun playing with others on this game. the games can be long, but they are a fun ride the whole way through.",138.9
"you begin to play your first game of civ 5, curious. after a few hours, you are pleasantly surprised. you finish, and you are addicted. this game will consume you. its strategy... you say to yourself, attempting to justify the days you spent attempting to keep ai citizens happy. 100+ hours later, you look back and wonder, why didnt you just play tf2? 10/10 must buy immediately.",217.0

"very fun game. requires a lot of strategy, and is a great time waster (not that its a waste of time). really good mods, also.",275.2
"civilization v is one of the best strategic games i have played in a long time. while the ai can be a bit ridiculous (putting this very lightly) at times, the game itself is well crafted. the interface is clear, but not overly simplistic; and the tutorials, mixed into game itself, allow new players to quickly jump into the game. whether youre a veteran to strategic games, or someone just starting out, civilization v is the perfect addition to your steam library.",84.0

"i was one of the first to buy this game in 2010, and i was also one of the first to stop playing this because i, like many others, felt it was a watered down version of civ iv. however, with the two expansion packs that seem lovingly crafted by firaxis, the game is easily one of my favorite 4x and strategy games of all time. the end-game was brought to life by bnw, and g&k fixed all the ai concerns i had. if you like strategy games at all, buy this game.",60.6

"i half to say this game is much better and feels more complete and thought out than its previous versions. almost like the serious version of the civilization series and the additional content makes the game significantly more enjoyable and adds more diversity. i recommend this game to people whom enjoy strategy games or sophisticated game players...yes, quite.",107.5

"this game is amazing, but it will consume your life. its impossible to play without telling yourself just one more turn at least 200 times. the vanilla game is great, but you should add a few mods to enhance the gameplay a bit because its not perfect. i definitely recommend getting brave new world as well because it adds a lot of depth.",853.1

"my brother and i downloaded this game at the same time... i made fun of the gamers that played around 200 hours. then i realized this game was terrible, annoying and it was way to simple of a game. all it wanted was to just be played more, and i had to comply with its demands. i hate it, and yet i continue.",215.1

"an utter piece of  unless you have every piece of dlc, especially gods and kings as well as brave new world. with these dlc, the game goes from being an abomination to an actually fun sequel to the brilliant civ iv. it has its issues even with all the dlc and patches, but there is definitely still a lot of fun and enjoyment to be had with it.",310.4

"dont like board games, just because you dont like boards? bada-bing! civ 5, !",17.2
"ive played civ 5 for hundreds of hours at this point. its an excellent game, always challenging and a great way to spend a weekend. this game is endlessly replayable, and each new expansion just makes it better. with a huge community of mods, you can always find a new or interesting scenario, civ, or strategy to play. you can play it as deep or superficial as you want, although understanding the nuances of the game does give you a significant advantage, as you might expect. well worth your time and money.",459.1

"the best civilization ive ever played there are a lot of dlcs availeble, which in my eyes feesl a bit like farming, i got myself a few but there are not much improving the game - but see for yourself. the game itself is super, you nice graphics, the soundeffects are a little bit annoying when you play it a long time, and if you start it is hard to stop, its quite addictive. so all in all it is worth bying",236.1
"the civ franchise has be my goto crack for gameing for over a decade now. its like a love hate relationship.",244.1
"i bought this game thinking the reviews, though exaggerated, were positive. 24 hours later, i realized i had to work in the morning. took one more turn, then another, once more, then went to work. almost fell asleep at work. got home, more turns. perfect distraction on the way to the grave. 10/10",71.5
"this is one of the greatest games ive played, and one of the first big-time games i really went into. sure there have been bugs, and sure there have been moments ive really gotten annoyed at the way its worked, but overall i give it my highest approval.",223.9

"this was my first civ game so i cant compare it to past games, but ive thoroughly enjoyed this game since it first came out. each expansion has added a ton to the game. the first gods & kings expansion gave civ v a lot of depth and introduced a lot of new elements, i wouldnt buy any less than the gold edition for a new buyer. then the brave new world expansion added even more, so if youre able just buy it all.",118.1
"hardcore strategy freeks this is a must buy but i cant recomand this for anyone else youll be irritated by its pacing and how nearly every match becomes a battle for who can aquire the most uranium.",337.7
"this game is great if you like the strategy type of city/civilization builders. *note* gandhi is a smug piece of . he will come to ruin you if you denounce him... even if you trust him hell stab you in the back. theres no winning with that jerk.",2.1
"i could write a lengthy and detailed review but i cant lose much time, augustus is being a little  again. 10/10",111.1
"wow, what a game. it is so easy to spend hours upon hours into this. im not much of a fighter, so im glad there are ways of winning without firing a single shot, but dominating other players in single player is so much fun.",57.9
"... just ... one... more... turn... dangerously addicting, you have been warned.",88.5
"started one game, now have 100s or hours in. this will ruin your life, you wont be able to stop go back now, you can still save yourself! also cross-platform would be nice",49.0
"exellent game for those who like strategy, its a very creative game, i recomnd it... get it if you can",50.9
"this is definately the absolute greatest turn-based strategy game ever. i have been a fan since i first played civ iv and i could not wait for civ v, and i have to say that i was not dissapointed at all. the level of realism in the decision making aspects of the game is incredible and the graphics are phenomenol. if you are a fan of any genre of strategy game, i definately reccomend you getting this.",157.7
"why must i download the game that i own the cd for?! steam suxxxxxx!!!!!!!",0.7
"i love this game. it is the type of game that you can take a break from and come back to it weeks later and feel as if it were your first time. there is an infinite amount of ways to adjust the difficulty and no two games ever play the same. you may strive for world dominance and yet find yourself a cultural empire that is winning the hearts and minds of the youth around the world. a must buy if you like strategy games. just check out my hours logged...",535.6

"this is brilliant, to begin with, i was pretty unsure how the turn base would work, being a rts player for a long time. but, i have to say, the turn base is very smooth and quick when playing against ai or humans. this game has so much depth, it has civilizations and tech i had never heard of before and it has amazing replayability. i have only put in 42hrs so far, so playing online can be a bit intimidating, but the experience is amazing, the feeling you get when you discover gunpower and then an enemy rocks up to your city with tanks and nukes is amazing and makes you want to become a better player. 10/10 would recommend.",185.4
"played 37 hours of this  in the last 3 days. if you buy it, dont expect to re assimilate back to the real world.",81.3
"there are no stacks of units, every unit has its place and therefore meaning on the map. and i like that the most in this game. except this civ5 is very user friendly, and by this i dont mean simplicity of the ui only, but also general friendly design of the game. its beautiful. although the original game is all-sufficient, the 2 major dlcs introduced quite a lot of interesting content which organically fits the game mechanics and add a lot to the gamplay while still keeping the simplicity of how things are handled. the only thing i can complain about is a bit strange way of using mods, though the devs fixed it mostly. recommend.",165.7
"i have been playing civilization games since i was about 8 and have always been impressed. it has only gotten better over the years. if you like turned-based strategy games with multiple ways and fun interactiveness, then this is the game for you.",126.8
"this will not be a review but instead im using this as a way to get the word out to all new civilization players in general. the game changer for me was misterciv5s channel. watching his series of tutorials is the best set of intructional videos for all levels civ v. yt search:  misterciv5 over the many years, ive played all genres of video games but never a turn base game. let alone one of the most complicated or highest learning curve required to play a civilization game. theres a reason why i avoided civ game in the last 10+ years. but in the age of youtube tutorials, ive tried to give civ another go.",74.0
"among all games ive ever played, this is the one with the greatest long-term motivation and replayability. last bought the gods and kings dlc. it invented the religion points and many more features. it brought some new aspects, units and buildings which are useful and interesting and let you play the game again and again. so ... this game is my all-time favorite!",118.2
"civ 4 is a lot better..... they noobed it good for the casual gamers.....",9.5
"i need only one reason to not recommend this game. i wasted 3 days playing (at least 15 hours) because i accidentally pressed the retire button on the menu when i opened it to save my game. the game said i abandoned my civilization but that they were not worried as i would some day return, and also it gave me 2 options, go to menu (or something on those lines) and no. one more turn, one more turn. i used the last option thinking it will not actually retire me, so i kept playing, saved the game, and after many our when i finally get the diplomacy victory (world leader) nothing happens. surfing the web i learned that confirmation technology is not available in this game due to its compliated nature, i mean are you sure you want to throw all this time you spent to the trash? of course! you dont need to confirm that. seriously, what the  firaxis?!",120.3
"civ 5 was the main reason i dropped $900 on a hardcore gaming computer so yeah its got my recommendation",160.9

"some people just want to watch the world burn. ghandi prefers a nuclear winter.",67.7
"fantastic game. used to be a bit rubbish, but was massively improved by the expansions they released. now its incredibly engaging throughout the whole timeline of the game, even at the very late game. being in a position of power doesnt make the game any less interesting, because of the numerous victory methods, so the other civs always keep you on your feet.",72.6

"if you want to get a game that is worse than the total war ones then get this.",21.3
"not sure if it quite surpasses civ 4, but it gets significantly better with every expansion, and is itself an amazing game; its system is quite a bit different than civ 4, and is therefore worth playing for any lover of civilization",253.6
"an amazing game to take away some time, and loose your self in a world where your the god and can dictate the turning of time.",513.5

(cause why give cookies when you can give cakes?!)",862.8
"this game is not for the faint of hearted, sure there are lower diffuiculty levels but this game is not for the casual gamer. that is the thing i enjoy the most about this game is that you really have to think and the victor is determined by whomever has the best strategy. growing up on civ iii and then civ iv this one is by far the most fun to get into.",106.3
"only have to say one bad thing about this game... the d.l.c. is waaaaaay too expensive.",35.5
"super fun strategy game thats really hard to quit.",121.4

"good game, not as good as civ iv, but good none the less",848.1
"i dont normally write recommendations but for the sake of the steam promotion, heres one! hard to go wrong recommending any game in the civilization series, this game being the latest. it doesnt improve upon (or replace) civilization iv in every way, but it is prettier than civ iv, and introduces some interesting new mechanics. i dont play it frequently, and thats because a single game of civ can take tens of hours, and is consistently difficult to tear yourself away from once begun. if you look at civ screenshots or gameplay videos and you think, that doesnt look fun or that looks too hard - youre wrong on both counts. you need to play it to understand why its so compelling, and its not as difficult as it looks. if youve never played civ, id highly recommend it, and this isnt a bad place to start.",70.6
"i enjoy it a bunch. a single game takes hours to complete, and the suspense of a new world each time you play helps to change up how the game will be played. i recommend it to those who enjoy sitting down to play an intense game for an entire afternoon.",364.1

"over the course of the last week i managed to play for one day. the rest of the time the game refused to start. i tried everything from driver updates to windows updates, from restarting steam to rebooting the whole machine... but no, the game doesnt work correctly anymore. there also seems to be alot of people who also have that problem, while others dont. i dunno why that is so and i dont care. if its an error with the program itself, they have to fix it. if its an issue with steam, they have to work wit valve to fix it. since its pretty much gambling wether you can start the game or not, if you dont have the game yet, i would say save your money. also the last civ ill buy for the next years, since i dont trust them to do better with the next one.",256.1

"i founded new berlin right on top of where modern day edinburgh sits today. we built such wonders - the brandenberg gate (naturally), the leaning tower of pisa, big ben... we even built the great wall of china right across hadrians wall. people loved that city and came from miles around to marvel at its majesty. great men were born - rommel and alan turing, marching arm and arm across the rooftops of the world. at one point one of my famous playwrites even penned the fabulous wizard of oz. but then, just as we were on the cupse of the atomic age... the manhatten project poised to usher in a burning nuclear dawn over the south of england (and a unit of stone age archers id left forgotten down there), i was confusingly defeated by a random vote at the un which appointed my hapless opponent as world leader. game over.",157.5

"ive always been a great fan of the civilization series and have played all of them, except 2, as they came. though no aspects of it are anything id consider too radical from the original ideas, the steady improvments built on the previous versions have made it better and better. if you enjoy these style strategy games, civ v wont let you down.",756.2

"immersive does not begin to describe this strategy game. its easily one of the most addicting games out on the market, thanks to its decpetively quick turn-based gameplay. each turn is quick on their own, which sets up the just one more turn mentality. which is why any gameplay session - lasting from either five minutes to five hours - will feel like it has gone by quickly. if you want to have your sense of time distorted while roleplaying as an emporer, then this game is meant for you.",355.0
"love this game. game play is excellent, but i do miss the cheats from previous version. i dont like that i have to run steam on mac to play it, the software slows down my computer, runs with out my consent, has to be manually configured to not launch whenever boot the machine for example.",81.8
"i have been playing civ since civ2:tot. tot still remains my favorite as far as interesting game modes and simple mechanics. civ 5 is no louse though. i love to complicated ways i have to work and the mods are absolutely a blast to use and give me back the civ 4 and 3 experience.",770.0

"having not played civ since my old uni days (many a decade ago) i found the latest iteration simple to pick up and get my hands dirty with, the ui is pleasing and aside from some minor gripes well thought out. gameplay is still addictive and the one more turn ethos still permeates through and it is very hard to put down i havent yet played mp as yet as i am just getting my old head round all the mechanics before i dip my toe into that",104.4
"as a hardcore strategy gamer who is no stranger to planning out my empires production dozens of turns in advance, ive already turned to civ v for my world-conquering needs  but at the same time, if anything is going to rear a new generation of strategy gamers like the very first civilization did for me, its this.",57.6
"awsome strategy game, for all sid meyers fans: this is one to pick up. bought at steam sale, well worth every cent.",7.1
"calling this game good would be a bit of a stretch. it has some nice new inovations likw the hex tiles........oh thats it. i personaly feel this game is in every single way inferior to civ 4 and the way that the modding has been almost imposible is shocking. the mod comunity for every previous version of the game added to the flavour. sid seems to have decided that they should be  blocked like they did with xcom which was another shocker.",15.0

"good game. much better than sid meiers civilization and revolution. apparently not as good as sid meiers civilization iv but i wouldnt know as i have yet to play it. very enjoyable game. plenty of free mods available. have to admit though, the multiplayer is slightly disappointing but you can spend hours on singleplayer.",210.4
"this game is like a drug dealer. it starts you off simple, and is real newbie friendly. then the next day you come back for some moere. before you know it, its 3am and youve foggoten to have dinner again and on the rare moments when you do sleep you hit your alarms snooze button muttering to yourself just one more turn.",295.3

"i am totally addicted to this game. three hours flew by as things started to get heated.",9.6
"good game if you like strategy... unlike most historical strategy games, war is not the priority (unless you go to a domination victory). this game is very random, you can discover the newest technologies with iroquois or babylons, or start in ancient era with america. i reccomend. 9/10",73.4

"if you love causing mayhem and you are great with strategies you will love this game!!!!!!!!",112.2
"dont have a single dlc for it and it is by far one the best games ive ever played! easly in the top 5, the ai is a bit weird, like gahndi once he completes the manhattin project just spawns nukes everywhere, but realy thats no reason not to buy this marvel of computer gaming, because the real reson to buy this is for the multiplayer. if you even consider buying a grand paradox game buy this now!",135.2
"this is a turn-based game which you probably already know.it doesnt have the smartest ai.but it has a ton of replay value.tons of fun.if you do buy this game buy the complete edition.ive had the burden to buy most of the content that didnt come with the game.",55.9

"great game. extremely time consuming. i never thought i would play a game for a whooping 325 hours (so far) in some 6ish months. i you think about getting it. do yourself a favour and get the gnk and bnw dlcs; they add a crapload of gameplay. vanilla game: 75/100 game with all dlcs: 95/100",631.5

"sid meiers civilisation v is, quite simply, the best strategy game i have ever played, if not the best game full stop. with its ease of access for newcomers, plus depth and multi-facetted strategic gameplay for crazy strategists, this game is just as good as you hope it will be, and then some!",92.9
"probably one of the best strategy games ive ever played. really fun to play on teams with your friends. very time consuming but so strategical. put many hours into this game and had some amazing and hilarious outcomes. would definetely recommend picking this game up.",72.5

"very nice game, it maybe is for ppl that are new to very difficult but after some time you grow to like this game and its not very hard.",316.1
"the game limits your expansion with a crude happiness mechanic and the ai has no idea about hex based tactics resulting in a sadly broken game. lacks the charm of the 1st.",44.9
"super addicting turn-based strategy. can be played by newcomers to the genre & by hardcore gamers. i have had a lot of fun with this game in single player & also in multiplayer co-op mode with my non-gamer girlfriend. highly recommended!",64.6

"something about watching ghandi drop nukes on the aztec empire is just really, really appealing.",267.2
"so, if you have a grudge against certain people and or countries i think this game is perfect for you! economically demise anybody, kill them, or become their friend in this game and make sure that they dont  you over. this game is a strategy game that allows you to have complete control and it has easy to grasp mechanics, you just have to pay a little attenion. 10/10 would suck  for it",165.6
"i really liked this game. i struggle with it, but enjoy it. thats life i guess :$",78.9
"this game is absolutely immersive and utterly amazing. most who have watched me play the game are reminded of the board game risk, but i find it to be much better. the tech tree is ridiculously thorough and even includes everything from pottery to giant death robots. the gameplay dynamics are complicated, yet, elegantly integrated, and very rarely get old. i can find almost nothing bad about this game, other than perhaps unreasonable ai. 9/10.",210.4
"play ittt! i need more people to play it with. its sooooo funnnnn",94.0
"i have exams to revise for, but, just one. more. turn...",298.5

"after 300hours of playing this i can say. dude. get the game. i managed to play this 300 hours without getting bored dude. its epic. its fun. its interesting. and guess what! you actually learn stuff too. so your parents will like if you play this aswell. go play. be happy! i am not asking. i am commanding. this game is too sweet to not be played",430.6
"this is one of the best strategy games out there. definitely pick up the expansions, as well!!!",273.8
"11/10, easily the best game i have played in.. so long it has everything a strategy game needs, all the ways to win, you dont have to go around and killing everyone, no, you can trade and just search for what you need, you can form alliances in order to get what you need.",93.7
"this game is so much fun! its also educational (this game tought me more about history than school.) control your empire and become (a, a warmonger (b, peaceful nation or (c, stay out of the way and research to victory",73.8
"ill make it quick. before you start a game, make sure you have done everything that needed to be done during the day before you begin. 12 hours of play time will feel like an hour and next thing you know its 6 in the morning and you need to leave for work in 15 minutes.",111.6
"danger: prepare to disappear from real life. hope that your family is still there when you return. make sure the bills are paid, hook an i.v. up, cinch up those depends, and dont be surprised when you wake up in the future like the guy in the film idiocracy... this game is addicting.",595.9
"very fun turn-based strategy combined with a large tech tree,city managment,world wonders with amazing bonuses,massive amount of diffrent troops,tons of civilizations to play as with many bonuses, some great dlc, and a whole lot more! civilization 5 is also really easy to pick up and play i think, give it an hour or so in single player with advisor on everything and youll learn most things, or you can turn the advisor off and go in blind and figure it out yourself! all in all civilization 5 is an amazing game that you really should pick up.",416.5
"addictive & gorgeous. gods & kings makes the game 1000x better - religion is fun!",19.5
"say goodbye to all your friends. takes at least 40 hours to have a nice laid back game of this. seriously messes up your sleeping pattern as well.",124.4
"this game will keep you entertained for the longest time either alone or with friends",305.1
"great game if you like fps shooters. has many perks and killstreak rewards. amazing game, one hit knife kills, quickscoping action. what more could you ask for? be grateful theres no annoying 6 year olds always screaming for booby milk through the voice chat. conquer, unite, explore, or thrive. your choice",67.6
"great game!!!!!!! a really good addition to the civilization collection.",23.1
"welp, besides the semi-constant crashing and what not, im ok with this game. and more intrested with the game mods, even for bronies like me, with many civ mods for equestria, crystal empire, and changelings. oh, and there is some wow and middle earth/lotr mods in there too. 7/10 would play it, but not worth getting or having my freinds get it.",69.2
"bitterly disappointing. nearly everything that made civ4 a great game has been pared back, and what remains is a shallow and meaningless turn based strategy game where everyone seems at perpetual war with everyone else. corporations, espionage and religion are the main things that i really miss, but also the way that the civ4 leaders all had a personality. now its just like a 10 player (or whatever) skirmish mode with leaders you couldnt care less about and faceless city states that act as nothing but speedbumps on the road to domination. lame, really lame. graphics are sweet, hexes (instead of squares) are good, one unit per hex combat is different (not bad per se), the rest is dumbed down rubbish. its like civ for console kiddies. 4/10.",58.2
"a really good game. it can be very exciting and satisfying depending on the difficulty level.",106.8
"everything you love about civ in a bettter looking package. a few things have changed and at first that frustrated me but one week later i had put 20 hours into the game. just like the good oldays. ^_^ just as addicting as always.",385.5
"ive never had a turn based game made me lose track of time the way civ v has. i keep coming back for more. great game",90.6
"this is a good game other than the fact that it overcharges for feautres that should have been introduced in the first edition.",19.5
"this game made me sit at my computer for several hours at a time. 10/10 would play again",35.1
"civ 5 is... amazing. one of the best strategy games i have ever played, and i recommend it to all. just be prepared to spend a lot of time per game; this is like the board game risk except 100x more complicated and it takes as much skill as luck.",242.5
"fun turn-based strategy game that allows you to make friend or foe with the other leaders that are on the campaign with you. strike a trade, open your borders, or make war and steal their cities. watch out for barbarians.",68.6
"really good for wasting days when i should be working. if i didnt have this game i might actually have to do something productive...",181.9
"awesome game, had it for about a year and i love it! just one problem, for some reason i am unable to create a religion! otherwise this is the best game i have!",72.0
"the wee hours of the morning will sneak up on you while playing civilization v. highly recommended!",86.7
"alone, civilization v is a great game, but with its two expansion packs and all of its add-on content, its one of the best strategy games one could ever come across on the market. so, if you want the full civ v experience youre going to need to cash out atleast on brave new world, which in many ways is the successor of civ v, the rest is really just great for the content it adds and increasing the variety in civilization choices as well as the pre-set scenarios. so overall, civilization v is great, but its outstanding with that second expansion.",556.7
"greetings and blessing be upon you. will you build a kingdom that stands the test of time?",291.2
"very good turn based strategy with very complex elements.",9.1
"civ v brings the civ game to a whole new level of fun, however it is highly recommended to play with friends for the ai can be very predictable (predictable does not mean easy however) despite tech trading being out of the game the new features higly make up for it and turn the core civ gameplay into something much more in depth. civ v is a solid fun title and if you enjoy turn based strategy civ v is the game for you.",256.9
"great game of which is verry fun. getting started is not very easy but you get there...",2.3

"nuking england as gandhi. 10/10 would radiate earth again.",108.9
"awesome! just needs the multiplayer debugging and theyd have the best online multiplayer strategy game around.",932.8
"its one of the best games of his category. very enjoyable in single player but multiplayer is hard to play with others",112.9
"truly a great game. enticing multiplayer that can be saved and finished later. complex gameplay and deep strategy. the only con: annoying french.",34.3
"i dont think im very good at this game, but it is extremely fun. after watching some videos online ive started understanding things more and its quite entertaining. well worth the money.",88.6
"this is a great game, however with the expansion packs it is soo much better. i highly reccomend god and kings expansion, the brave new world expansion is fun but not as good as the gnk expansion. many reviews stated this game was not as good as previous version, and indeed the early versions of this game were not, however with expansions and update it certainly is a good game.",126.4
"a cool game exept that the ai is  but otherwise this is an awesome game",240.2
"very good strategy game, fun and addicting. you can play as many civilizations and there are lot of dlcs that adds additional maps, scenarios and civilizations.",90.1
"this is an excellent investment, if you enjoy single player turn based strategy games. its better than any previous civilization game, and the only thing it is lacking is playable multiplayer. the mulitplayer just takes far too long to play a game. its meant to be a single player game. its a deep and complex strategy game with a fun atmosphere. i will be playing it from time to time until the next civ game comes out. the only alternative to this that i would recommend as far as turn based is civilization revolution for consoles. its not nearly as deep but if you like multiplayer more than single, then you can play a game of civ rev in a reasonable amount of time for mulitplayer. this game is one of my top 5 favorite games.",141.6
"one more turn.... just one more turn... just one more-- oh, whats that? ive been here for four hours? oh well, im already running late, just one more turn shouldnt hurt... and maybe one more after that...",68.3
"this game is amazing! it is a very thought inspiring and creative game that realy makes you think how we have com as a species. i also love the historical aspects of it, giving you the opertunity to dive head first into the lives of ancient civilizations. 10 out of 10",592.6
"strategic, turn-based gameplay as famous battle leaders... i just can not stop playing this game!",59.2
"civ 5 is one of those games where you look at the clock, and 6 hours have passed. a game where you will stay on for one more turn 10/10 would buy again",116.3
"really cool game :) very complex game and i like it :)",17.6
"this is by far one of my favorite strategy games, even though it is turn based and i usually prefer rts over tbs. warning! this game requires a lot of patientce.",109.7

"you can play as a communist dictatoral ghandi who kills all and rules with an iron fist.",26.7
"do you not like change? are you a diehard fan of the previous civilization games and dont want to change to this new, dynamic sequel? well suck it up and play it.",98.3
"get this game if you plan on also getting the gods & kings expansion to go along with it. the revamped combat and naval warfare systems, along with the introduction of religion, really round out the base game.",627.3
"its mother flippin civilizationn v! whats not to love?",348.8
"hell yes bad  strategy game. spent tons of hours on this game and im still just a noob, recommended for you and your friends.",42.3

"addictive and fun but... some annoying bugs here and there prevents this from being the turn based game anyone wanted 9/10",24.8
"this game is amazing! i spent too many hours playing it. keep in mind it changes from the previous civs by doing one unit per tile. best with gods and kings.",543.6
"amazing turn based strategy game. great for experienced and new comers alike, the tutorial modes go from a simple one that gives you the basics while playing (great for experienced strat players), to more in depth guides. with amazing graphics and music, as well as tons of dlc and community mods, you will get loads of gameplay time out of this game. i suggest the goty addition which includes all but the 2 most recent dlcs for only 20$ more.",351.7
"i recomend to get this game but if you want a good experience than youll need bnw this game without bnw (or g&k)isnt as good as civ 4 (allways have them time in the eyes)",306.4
"ive been playing civilization since the very first and i have to say this is the best one. for a game with the same core mechanics going back almost 20 years, it feels fresh and new. each different nation is unique enough to make you want to play through them all, and the game has kept its depth and difficulty while being easier to play at the same time. if you have ever enjoyed any of the civ games you will love this one.",172.1
"civ v is a must have for anyone who enjoys strategy games. its especially fun with others, whether its a friend, a big group of friends, or just random people. the dlcs are honestly worth the extra money.",234.7
"to be honest, at first i did not like this version of the civ series. being an original civ fan i struggled with the graphics and the gameplay (the fact you can no longer stack units on a sqaure really annoyed me!) however, a few hours later, and im hooked. the unit stacking issue actually makes you think more and the graphocs are actually quite cute. if youre after a simluation/stragety game that lasts for hours and hours then buy this. so much fun, so many outcomes, one of the few truly replayable games.",55.1
"great game. i was intimidated by it to start but once i jumped in and just played it was awesome. lots to learn and a good time sinker.",169.2
"welp what can i say this was actually my first game on steam and would you look at that 200 hours later and suddenly im writing my first review on that very same game ! seriously though this game is addicting as it gets its almost impossible to stop in between a session (unless you are playing a marathon game) !great game, great replayabilty, lots of fun ! i also heavily advise in buying the dlc adds lots of content !",244.5
"i prefer the total war series but this is pretty good.",31.4

"an extremely complex strategy game that sucks you in with its mesmerizing depth and unregulated pacing. it may seem overwhelming at first but you will find yourself glued to this game for hours while surrendering former real-world provisions such as food and sleep. the only major shortcoming this game has is the ai, which is often irrational at best and stupid at worst. the game clearly favors war over diplomacy, but regardless there is more than enough strategy to last you for hundreds of hours.",332.6
"the civilization series is amazing, so many hours well spent dominating the world. would be nice if there was a better online prescence but singleplayer is great. if you love turn based grand strategy this is the game for you!",137.8
"ill be the thousandth person to say how addictive this game is, but its digital heroin. anyways, its awesome, and well worth the money.",233.4
"fabulous, deep, engrossing. the move to a single unit per tile is a double edged sword - on the one hand, it makes you consider how to best use your army (rather than the stack of doom seen in earlier iterations of the series), but on the other, the ai does not use it effectively (pre-brave new world - this may have improved it but i havent played with this expansion), and it can be easy to crush the ai militarily. that aside, the game is otherwise outstanding.",132.1

"a fascinating game. incredibly fun with unrelenting involvement and strategy.",121.5
"i have always loved sid meiers games and this one is no exception. civilization 5 is much improved on the 4th civ in diplomacy, trade, combat, and culture. there are balance issues, for instance, in combat a fight you should win you somehow lose, however, it is still much imroved from the last one. if you are new to civ this is a good one to start with. if not there are plenty of new aspects while keeping the core of civ alive. highly recommeded to any strategy game player!",75.8
"loved playing civilization revolution on the xbox 360 so i decided to get a newer version. visuals are awesome, much more indepth and you compete against more then just 3 rival civs. the leaning curve was tricky to begin with but with all the pop ups (which you can turn off) that give you tips and explain stuff for you really helped. this game is amazing for people that want abit of longevity to their games. maybe wait for a sale. i paid 20 though and i think it was worth it.",44.9

"i dont know why this game is so popular. of course its always funny when you start playing at 20:00 and realise 6 hours lather that its now 2:00 in the morning, or when you declare war on ghandi. but the main problem of this games is the lack of elements of gameplay. its too easy to win battles, you just need to train more units than the ennemy. at some point its not even fun anymore. it might get very boring sometimes !",48.2

"civilization v is honestly one of my favorite stratigy games. it can be fun in single player but when you have friends to play with it gets even more fun. for anyone who likes a got stratigy game then this is a game you should have. there are quite a few difficulty levels you can choose from to make your game more challenging. you have to keep up with so many asspects at once that it can feel a bit overwellming your first few games, but you will get used to it. with the brave new world and gods and kings dlcs it can add a whole lot to the game and almost make you feel like your having to change your play style completly. overall i would recommend buying this game.",156.5
"best rts ever made, and in my personal top 10 games of all time. in civ 5, you assume the role of a past great leader, like washington, ghandi, queen elizabeth and so on. you rule and control their respective countries build your own empire. you do so by raging war, or making peace with others. i highly recommend buying at least the two major expansions. (gods & kings, and brave new world). theyre huge really game changing expansions. like adding religion to the game, which could mean the difference between friendship or nuclear war. as far as time goes, you start in the year 4000 bc (by default). and progress your empire through the ages all the way into the future. even though beyond earth (next entry in civ) is already on the horizon, civ 5 is a true masterpiece. buy this game now.",102.2
"this game provides literally hundreds of hours (or more) of fun. the randomness of the maps, the large amount of civilizations, the multiple different ways to victory, and the many ways to achieve that makes this game so unique that its impossible for it to feel repetitive. this is well worth the cost and definitely a game to get. now if youll excuse me, i have to get back to playing!",122.0
"probably in the top 5 game ever made, it is the second game in the civilization universe i have ever played with the first being civilization on the ps3, the amount of detail put into the game is so entirely breathtaking that i could literally play this game for days, in fact ive had it for less than a week and im already closing in on a full day of gameplay... 5 out of 5. cant wait to see where beyond earth takes the franchise but i can pretty much gaurantee i will be there to see!",28.3
"simply stunning. not only is the gameplay fun (and quite addicting), this game offers something more than just mindless entertainment: it provides cultural awareness, not only to wonders of the world, but to people who have influenced this world. and the soundtrack is just beautiful. an excellent work of art.",758.0
"very deep turn-based strategy game. its a lot of fun, but you have to be careful because it will suck you in and youll lose hours upon hours.",211.7
"the only thing bad about this game is how long it takes to play and the lack of any form of a stopping point. you can spend hours sitting their thinking ill get off right after i conquer the greeks. suddenly you look up and you realize you started playing 5 hours ago.",313.4
"been playing civilization since the first one and they just keep getting better.",467.9

"great game to play with friends, not worth it at full price, but definitely worth it when on sale.",258.5
"this game is really fun if youre into strategy games. there is a lot to learn and i have a lot to go through before i can call myself savvy in civilization v. all in all, as a beginner, it is pretty user friendly and the help menu has all the info you need, and more.",16.9

"civ 5 is a complex and unbelivebly polished game with great expansions to boot. the mechanics are simple and the inteferce is generally well done. diplomacy, religion, science and combat are so well intertwined with each other and makes for countless strategies and hours of gameplay. i personally feel that there is not much that is lacking apart from perhaps a better way to give new players an idea of what each victory condition means and also give certain hints, e.g for cultural victory have a set amount of wonders that are required so new players can work towards them. 10/10",168.9
"if you wanna hate your best friends, play this game, its awesome !",111.6
"if your familiar with rts games then you will enjoy this, if your not it can be difficult to learn but once you learn how to play its fun. the game is also very time consuming, so if you have a couple hours to spend this is the game for you!",97.5

"civilization five in my opinion the best in the series it completly balances the game and is even better with brave new world.",363.0
"when civ 5 came out, i didnt like it at all. i still wouldnt like it, if not for the exceptional expansions that address pretty much every flaw (except the ai, which i still find a bit silly, but i find almost all ai flawed) its friendly and fair to the new civ players, and has enough content to keep the veterans occupied. i especially loved the scenarios.",80.8
"fantastic game! quit diferent compared to the other civiziltions! hope to god civ vi comes out",191.7
"one of the handful of games that simply doesnt get old for me. uniquely engaging and expertly designed, civilization has been killing it since the beginning.",253.8
"i like to play this game every once in a while and is great for stategy gamers who will play for a long time since civ 5 is not a fast paced game so on a scale to 0-10 i would give it a 8/10",161.8
"civ 5 is an excellent blend of singleplayer and multiplayer. the singleplayer is fast paced and fun. it can also help you build skill in the game. the multiplayer is a great blend of backstabbing, friendship, and war. it is fun to explore different worlds and bring your civ to greatness and glory. overall, i give this game a 9/10. an excellent game!",74.6
"great soundtrack, has some sense of education to it for people who are vaguly interested in history. obviously if you play with ghandi he will be historically accurate and stock up on nucleur warheads and put the entire world consisting of 3 continents into a cold war or m.a.d. and when you play as venice make sure you become a real life banker and get loads of bonuses and make sure everyone is denpendant on you for their economy. also the multiplayer experience is not that bad the connections between players can be dodgy so frequent saving is an order, and combat is ok despite the quick animations. if you dont have this game....get it on sale or wait until the next civ gme in a few months....listen to your advisors....exept your military one...dont be like me",540.9

"more than 800 hours.....my life guys....no i have shared it with my family. but as someone who has above 800 hours of this game on there account trust me when i say best pc game of the year. simple. cant wait for more.",822.6
"with the bnw expansion the game is now very deep and enjoyable. there are many different and well-balanced paths to victory. as someone who started playing civ 2, it has taken me awhile to adjust to civ 5. they may have the same names but they are fundmentally different games. in one the key to win was near constant expansion and the creation of doom stacks. civ 5 is pleasantly different. pros: culture system is finally come into its own ai is no longer horrible at war all systems well balanced and thoughtful stratagy is rewarded cons: the non-cheating ai (prince) is still not nearly as good at the gam e as any human",133.1
"what can i say about this title that hasnt already been said by its mass success as a turn-based strategy game? featuring some of the most iconic characters in history, from montezuma to george washington himself, you are able to take control of them and their respective nations and work for peace to achieve a greater good... or wreak havoc on any who dare cross your path (i usually use ghandi for that). with an extensive list of options to customize your game and a very long technology tree, this game offers replayability like no other. get together with some friends or play a solo match on god difficulty... whichever you choose, any strategy game fan will have a blast with this title. i guarantee it.",77.9
"if you dont care about maintaining a relationship with your friends, or having a social life, this is a must play.",91.8
"crazy amazing fun! if you love strategy, you have to play it. not for the casual gamer!",228.2
"another massive improvement on its predecessor, with all the expansions there are ludicrous factions to play as and various tactics you can employ to win. if you just like crushing your enemies into oblivion then total war is probably a better bet for you as the combat is simplistic but using politics, science, religion and culture to convert or defeat enemies is very rewarding.",280.4
"turn base games are great for getting your stuff done!",91.5

"this game is like having the most amazing  of your life and then the mailman comes right in the middle and you have to stop half-way through and rush hurriedly to the door. my point is, games take so god damn long that unless you have the next 6 hours spare, dont start a game.. because something will always come up, and online games cant be paused, mom! 3/5 overall though, i like the game, but finding the time to play it is a right ball-ache.",35.6

"so i owned this game for about 6 months before i started playing it. i have fallen in love with this game, whether because i feel like a badass when i crush each little city-state, or because dido is one hot mistress, im not sure. but i would definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes to feel like a badass, and play like a cheat. this game is also a good way to get your brain into a very strategical mindset. after 150 or so hours of playing, im sure i could be a 5 star general. in short: buy this game. stock up on extra food first.",23.2
"civilization series is very addictive. i played this game for 5 hours straight last saturday i believe. it is a turn based strategy, but you really dont feel like that. the line between turn based strategy and real time strategy is hard to tell the difference these days. i recommend this game if it on sale. you wont have huge options available as far as what youll do, but if you are looking for a simple way to replay the same thing over and over agin and totally dominate the world, then i recommend this title. you will be building lots of roads and making huge cities waiting to offend foreign leaders who get in your busniness for no reason.",15.6
"i really enjoy this game it is good fun. one downside is that it is long, but in the same it is good for me anyway because i love games that take a while to complete. i recommend it to anyone that enjoys building, war, or just playing with friends",491.0
"in theory, civilization doesnt appeal to me. but in practice? i have played the game for hours on end, unwilling and unable to stop. it sucks you in and doesnt let you go. i cant comment as to any changes from previous civ games to v and brave new world, as this is my first civ game to play. but i really enjoy the culture based victory. its the ultimate passive-aggressive way to win, imo. i may not have tons of soldiers. but look at my art!",14.1
"must have for civilization fans.. im a long time civ series guy but i havent had a pc to run civ 5. i finally picked it up. i love it.",70.4
"the kind of game you can easily get lost in for hours. not a game you can start up lightly, but with interesting strategic decision, and many paths to victory, this game never gets old. even with over 300 hours in game i feel i have not given the game anywhere near the time it requires to fully exlore.",304.5

"dispite the fact of war being a little to server punishement (i dont mind my people mad just i am disappointed that if you go to war every one but you allies and friends will want you 6 feet under) this is a intensly fun game and it is much more intese with mods because, you dont have a clue what to expect. if you want most of the workshop addons though you need g&k and brave new world dlcs but you will still have fun vinilla style.",201.9

"this is quite a fun turn-based 4x game. i own all the expansions and playable cultures, and i really enjoy the variety of playable peoples. the game is moderately taxing on the graphics card, but the real bottleneck comes from the cpu while it processes all the ai turns, particularly in the late game on a large map. i really enjoy this game, and i must admit that i have succumbed to the one more turn... bug on several occasions.",132.6

"amazing game of creating and maintaining a civilization from prehistoria tomodern times.",67.2
"i have been playing the civilization series of games since the third installment, and it feels like each iteration gets better and better. new/altered victory conditions and the inclusion of city-states as minor civilizations make for interesting changes from civ iv, as do the changes to unit behaviour and the use of a hex grid map. the removal of unit stacks makes it feel like builidng up a significant army can be done without costing a lot of time in infrastructure development, something that always bothered me in previous games, though the associated pathing issues can sometimes be annoying if youre not careful. overall i feel that civilization v is a step in the right direction moving on from civilization iv, and i recommend it for both casual and serious play.",139.1
"although less rich feature wise than previous civ games, civ 5 still stands as a great strategy game for new and old players alike. the game has a hell of a lot of replayability and is great to play with friends (providing youre willing to turn against them if needed, otherwise multiplayer games can get boring quickly). easy to pick up, difficult to master, as any good strategy game should be, highly recommend.",127.5
"omg this is my first civ game and wow this is my crack cocaine",164.0

"i am by no means a great rts player, but i still love games like civ v and other 4x/strategy games. this game series, more than any other, has the ability to make me lose track of time. the one more turn mentiality is easy to fall into as the game looks and plays great.",235.9
"civ v is a very good game to play both solo and multiplayer. just beware that it will make days many hours shorter than 24 hours!!!",921.3
"no doubt the best strategy game of all time. many hours have been spent having fun in this game. 10/10",42.8
"the greatest strategy game ive ever played. possibly the best game ive ever played.",558.9
"its civilization, what more do you really have to say? in any event, this is the most polished and entertaining game in the seires. the fact that its cross platform and runs like a dream with an intel hd 4600 gpu on linux helps a lot too. i cant recommend this game enough. hell if you get around to actually playing it, not only will you have fun, you might actually learn something!",16.2
"while i was disapointed at first with this game and its lack of historically plausible scenarios like with total war i still found myself enjoying it immensely. even if ghandi will attack sweden without provocation.",346.4
"this is a time consuming - high learning curve game. not as difficult as the older ones though.",844.2
"awesomely addicting game. i recommend this game for all the strategy-game lovers out there ! you will find yourself spending so much time playing it, thinking about it that you will only be able to say one thing about this: #worth :d",372.9
"from what ive heard, many people didnt like this entry into the civiliation franchise, but as a first time civ player i think its a wonderful game and is one of my favorites of all time.",238.3
"one of the best strategy games out there. its massive, and even beter with the expansions. you can also use a vast selection of mods in the workshop. there is a large content of gameplay mechanics. old units, modern units and even futuristic units are included as you research tecnology and science, choose religion and your peoples government system. you will be playing this game for a long time, hardly gets old. hours pass by in a blink of an eye. its possible to win in any way you like, destroy everyone or friend everyone, be a master in science, you choose. if you like complex strategy games, this is the one for you.",36.2
"i feel like the vanilla version of civ v was a step back from iv, but after the expansion packs, it has become a full civilization in my book. still not as good as civ iv, which i consider to be the best so far, but still good nonetheless. and it looks amazing.",356.2
"11/0 would buy again. after saying that i truly enjoy this game its absolutly addicting, and even better with mods and friends. never trust ghandi",164.8
"one more turn will become your mantra. and all of a sudden, it will time to shower, shave, and go to work.",215.8
"if you like strategy games at all, then you will love civ v.",61.5
"though not without its faults, for fans of turn-based strategy this is one of the best games currently available. addictive, with enough variability and opportunity for skillful play, it can keep your attention for sessions of 14 hours or longer regularly. highly recommended for anyone who enjoys strategic thinking, resource management, and games that challenge you to dig deeply into mechanics to learn and improve.",433.4
"ill just play for an hour or so. 8 hours pass. omfg! im gonna be late for work!",169.4

"as you can see at my profile - i played just 3 hours, so, you can ask me why did you write this rewiew? go f*ck yourself! but please!.. i played this game for a long time, but in a profile of my best friend, its not very important!.. so, what can i tell you about this game? does this game can be so expensive? does this game can have a dlc? yes, of course! this game is awesome! i can make the great revolution in korea! i can build a pyramide in russia! this is f*cking awesome! more better than other strategy games (beside a supreme commander 2)! i reccomend this game for all people and gamers at this world! really! its true! p.s. dlc with korea is awesome! :3",120.4

"historical fiction: yes famous world leaders: yes interdependant trade: yes as many bugs as skyrim: no",23.0
"i have always been a man who loved games that used their simplicity to deceive the player into thinking the game is easy, even though its not. though not really a simple game, civ 5 is certainly less complex than many other games in the turn-based strategy genre, and i personally dont think it suffers as a strategy game at all because of that.",149.6
"like why? why would u not play this game? its an epic fantasy for gods sake. u can do whatever the hell u want!",911.6
"fantastic game! if you have played past civ games, you will love this. certain elements to the game, such as barbarians, have improved to seem far more realistic.",45.2
"score: 6/10 this game just didnt hold my interest. to me it lacked an interesting game world and story. it is pure mechanics and online play. if you want a single player experience, story, or an interesting world look someplace else. if on the other hand pure mechanics is fine then buy this game because the mechanics are rock solid.",7.1
"a great game about civilization with a great touch... throught my childhood the first civ was my game and after civ four this just nails it!",217.2

"ive spent alot of time in this game and it is fantastic, 5 stars, i only wish you could stack units but i understand why they chenged it i really havent played any of the other ones but this one is great if me and my friends had the time i would bplay more but the singleplayer is still tons of fun. i would recomend this to a friend!",312.6
"this game is probably one of the best games ive ever played! it is probably one of the best strategy ever made that is why it gets a 10/10 from me! :d",193.9
"civilization is an amazing game were you can have basic strategies but everything has to be freestyled to go with who you are allied with and who is near you or on the same continent. i love playing this game and have been through four playthroughs all of which were vastly different. in some i mastered technology to win, in others i conquered the world and bent great cities to ruins with nuclear weaponry. or i have founded the un and let the world choose me to lead it. but overall this game is only matched by games that have the same level of strategy but are mmos, but if you are looking for a way to strategize on your own with a great ai that truly does come close to the level of stategy you face while playing an mmo then this is the best game for you.",170.2
"there are mods to be the lord of the rings guys and the code geass characters. btw..... code geass won 10/10 would mind control again",28.4
"a most excellent rts. my first civ game, most definetly not my last !!!",177.4
"its always one more turn and before you know it 4 hours have passed by! love this addicting game!",314.0
"i have to admit that i never thought i would like this game. i was a die hard civ iii fan (and i still love it). but this game is gorgeous and has some great things about it. i found the hex grid hard to get used to, but after getting used to it, its much more intuitive than civ iiis grid. i actually like the fact that i cant stack a hundred things on top of one another (though ive heard people complain about that) because i keep track of my units better that way. one thing i really dont like is the extra restrictions on movement. you cant even go through an enemys space at all, even to pass through and you ship cant risk dangerous deep water (a gambit i am very fond of in civ iii). other than that, i love this game. it may even be my favorite out of the civilization games.",206.8
"i like just keeping to myself and having large cities until i take up most of the space then i expand my military just in the off chance im attacked. im usually able to go without a war and win in another way. 10/10 you should play",66.2
"you will need all the dlcs to realy enjoy this (not the maps silly, the game mechanic changeing ones) or it will only be 4/10. i am no fan of the new combat system so for me its an overall 8/10. no must havebut a lot of fun, 3 and 4 are still better imo.",299.4
"this is a great game, but it takes a lot of time to complete a game. and playing with friends is sometimes a nightmare because you have to finish the game online or meet each other in real life to finish the game. would rate 8 out of 10.",231.0
"while it started out a little weak, civ 5 has grown, through its expansion packs, to be worthy of its pedigree. a masterful return to the series. if you love civ, pick this up and get yourself at least the gods & kings and brave new world expansions.",276.9
"its a really fun game. you lose track of your time as you try to conquer the empires near you to win the game. i would even recommend this to people so they can lose their social lives too lol. 10/10 lose your life if you buy this game",32.9
"love the game. im always playing it so much to do, so many ways to win. it is one of them games you cant stop playing. 11/10",111.1

"in a class of its own, a true strategy historic masterpiece 9.5/10.",75.0
"excellent game. they think of all the ways you could possibly run a turn based kingdom and give you the options to change everything from the workers working certain buildings to the ability to expand your kingdom accross the map with minimal militaristic movement. just expect to be sitting down for hours at a time trying to finish a game. 95/100",170.9
"you start playing this, you look at the clock, you have just wasted your saturday. love this game",289.3
"reading all these reviews are really adicting, ( i finaly beat ghandi",234.9
"very good game once you learne the basics. will definately keep you up late its hard to stop pressing the next turn button.",210.0
"amazing strategy game. like the civ series is known for the different victories combined with different civilizations make it interesting to play again and again. the combat system is really well balanced and built. i recomment this game if you are a patient gamer. for those that are used to fast paced rts games like warcraft, starcraft, age of empires, command and conquer etc. you will get frustrated with the pace, even on quick games it takes quite some time if you play with more than 4 civilizations. tl;dr: amazing game, it will suck you into hundreds of hours of greatness.",495.2
"incredibly enjoyable strategy game with multiple ways to win and even an included multiplayer. downsides: multiplayer has a memory leak that took creative custom patching to fix (as i did not have the brave new world expansion) and play with friends. there is no real single player campaign mode.",159.3

"one of the funnest games ive ever played. perfect for those late nights with friends or you got some serious time to kill. warning you will experience quite a bit annoyance with the barbarian hordes, but they are also a challenge in the game that makes this game interesting.",67.0
"civilization v is truely a new masterpiece. after playing over a hundred hours of the original game, i have since put more time into the expansions (which i highly recommend). while the game is not as in-depth as civilization 4, it certainly retains its fun and charm by making you want to click that turn button like a addict shooting dope. on another note, as of october 9, 2014 i have installed this game on my linux mint build to test the game on linux. it is far better than the windows version; mainly because the performance is much smoother and there is less cpu overhead from background processes. linux is a less demanding operating system, thus after 300 - 400 turns i have not experienced any sluggish behavior during turn cycles. this being said, i am quite pleased with how well aspyr media did on the job of porting this game. i give the windows version 8/10. i give the linux version 10/10.",242.8
"great when you have friends to play with but can become boring when without friends to chat with. if you love fast pace action packed games this is not for you, if you love strategy then youll have a blast.",6.2

"one more turn.... seriously this is as much fun as the originals were for me years ago when they were first released. hours of entertainment. just buy some eye drops first or a scraping tool, as youll have trouble peeling yourself away from this one!",68.9
"from a background of playing the aoe series, the first time i played civ 5 demonstrated the vast differences between the two, though once you transition from the real-time aoe to turn based civ, you discover a game beautiful in its design, unique in its design and diverse in its range of civilisations to choose from (with its expansion packs adding additional great content). while it can be slow to progess at times, this gives more time to experience the game for all its worth. as with most steam games, the modding compatability adds another level to the game ensuring additional content into the future. like with most games, the ai is not perfect, though i feel civ 5 does it better than some. overall a great game that can be played for hours and still only break the surface of all its contents.",33.2
"good game, a little hard to get used to after having played the older games, the other game -> civ 4 is a little more fun but after awhile you can get used to this one and be some what happy. if they never played the games before this one your be more then happy with the game play.",0.1
"i started a war with france and now the world is in ashes. 11/10. no really, great turn based strategy game, several ways to win and a ton of leaders with their own strengths and weaknesses. i highley recommend.",85.6

"you know that feeling when you play sims and youre in the building mode. that x100",61.8
"time just disappears when you play it. i started off thinking itd be ok, just a few hours here and there. yeah...no, it doesnt work like that. you have to have a reason to look away from it or else you wont. your social life, your friends, and even your family are non-existent when you play it. i started on oct. 10, 2014 and at the time of writing this i have 31.2 hours. and ~25 hours of that was one game that ended at 500 turns due to a time victory. so many hours gone but i couldnt be this happy about it with any other game, this is just the best ever. also, try to limit yourself on how many turns you go through in each play session. youll be thankful you did when it saves you from falling into complete addiction.",106.2
"if you have friends to play this with you, its a blast",294.5
"saw american minute men get steam rolled by native american tanks. 10/10 would play again!",199.2
"one of the best 4x strategy games out there. recomend the latest version (brave new world) since it fixes many of the things found in the first release and expansion of the game. buy it, build your empire and conqure your enemies!!! or if you wish, create paris and win with culture instead! :)",234.7

"does civilization v really need a review at this point? have you pressed end turn? press end turn. have you pressed end turn once more? press end turn. have you made your friends not desire to play the game with you anymore? press end turn. continue infinitely. (or at least until beyond earth comes out.) best game mechanic ever. 11/10.",68.8
"great game hours of great gameplay, very fun and strateigic at the same time. have had this a long time, and it never gets old. multiplayer is very fun, and the dlc gives a lot more too. if you like strategy, or just to play for fun buy this game.",110.5
"by far one of the only civilizations that ive consistantly played since i bought it.",129.2
"very time consuming game but extremely rewarding gameplay",18.7
"this game is one of the most addictive games i have played. first, theres more than one goal to achieve; you can win from multiple standpoints ranging from religion, cultural, military, and science victories. then you can go on to do what you please! its very interesting to have different outcomes each game, as you have to think of different senarios before you do your actions. 9.5/10",62.0

"just one more turn... since civilations i. i hate how this version severely punishes certain play styles, but still one of the greatest games ever made.",417.2
"extremely addicting. im not good enough to win on normal difficulty, id rather play on easy and feel like a god as a obliterate all the other civs or build everything beyond every civ. the interactions with the others civs has improved. previous civilzation games made me feel like a twerp to be bullied by every other civilization... either by demanding money and gifts or demanding i go to war with my ally.",99.9
"i love this game my only problem is i cant use the mods on my mac. i wish that they would create a way to offically install it so we could use it but other than that, i love this game. 9/10",170.8
"an amazing game for any fan of turn-based strategy. highly reccomend.",16.4
"i would recomend this game to anyone who just wants to play a game without much of a learning curve. it is a turn based strategy game where you take control of a lead from a great nation in history and as though tried to do, take over the world. it could be world domination by military, economic, technologicly, or by making a utopia. the choices are endless with who you want to team up with, who to destroy, who to backstab, and who to just completely ignore. even without all the dlc this game is very fun and has a lot of replay value in it.",32.4
"a great game overall. it plays very much like an integrated, advanced version of chess. be warned, you can very easily lose hours to this game without even realizing it.",212.7
"this game can indirectly taught me world history. i got higher grades of history because of civ",158.8

"best strategy game to date. i hope the new one lives up to the years of play ive had from this game.",662.7
"dont bother buying this game off steam. its a giant rip-off in comparison to the price and amount of content offered up by the gold version. search sid meiers civ5 gold and youll see that for $27 you can get almost all of the dlc, as opposed to spending $32 on steam for the game without any dlc.",85.1

"great game. played from 5pm to 10pm when i first got it. its just that great.",38.7
"i love this game, it is fun to play by yourself, but the real fun comes when you have a group of friends to play with and you let your suspicions take the best of you. if you wont put time into the game i would not recommend this game, this game takes very long and is very time consuming. a game with friends could last days, depending on the match settings.",258.6
"where would someone even start? its the newest civilization game to date and it is incredible. with the expansions this is one of the best turn-based stategy games ever. it also has great mod support for single player which adds tons of new civs to play as past the already impressive list of playable civilizations. more than worth its price. plus it almost always goes on sale during major steam sales. great game but it eats your time like nothing, not that youll mind while your playing.",225.2
"love this game great game for people who like long games and like to make huge armies and make destruction or you could always play it safe and win in other ways like science and culture.",170.0
"civ v really continues the great tradition of the series. with many changes and great familiarity, fans of civ iv will feel at home while feeling enough of a difference that it is another game. with many key changes such as a hexagon grid and only 1 unit per square, the game offers new challenges to learn. if you like god gods, this is for you.",236.4
"please disregard my play time as it has not saved. let me just say civ5 is a must have game for anyone, this is my favourite strategy game as of now and you should not miss out on a game this great!!!",7.7
"turn based strategy and loads of fun :) do not expect to be playing for an hour or two.... this game will eat away days and nights for that matter. it is by far one of the best turn based strategy games out there. so many things to do, so many people to conquer!",277.3
"this game shows thing that happen in the past, the present and the future which you can combind many stragtegy to win over your enemies.that include be common enemy to someone or make the alliance to overthrow the most powerful player from his seat of this game which can be done throught many ways either direct or from the way that they would never notice what coming for them.",82.9

"a really immersive and detailed game, that explores branches of strategy boldly. well worth my money, and i would urge everyone to try it.",90.9
"ive always been a fan since civ 2, though i was too young to really understand what i was doing. probably one of my favourite parts of the game is that you buy a game and an encycliopedia, and the quotes. i love all the amazing quotes in the game.",201.5
"i have one word to say about this game amazing this game is so addctive and make u keep playing hes hard sometimed but still not unbreakable this game have tons of situations to give u great gameplay that is easy good graphic and ton of replay vaulve 910",55.5

"another civilization. quality strategy game, but yeah, its still much of the same thing so if youre burnt out on the typical civ-take-over-the-world gameplay, you may want to try something different. its been a few years since i played a civ game so i dont know if this was implemented in civ4 and i dont remember it, but i really like the new mechanics for religion and diplomacy. espionage too is much more fair. i bought the gold edition so i get to play as a civilization that is sometimes shunned -- the vikings! another terrific civilization. if you played the older verisons, youll learn quickly. if youve never played civilization, youre missing out. maybe the best turn-based strategy series ever designed exclusively for the pc?",230.0

"this is a fantastic turn-based strategy game that will chew through your time like godzilla through tokyo. the screenshots may look like its a complex game, but its actually a very simple game with a lot of depth. the interface has been polished to such a degree that it keeps pulling you in. anyone willing to give this game 10 minutes of their time will find themselves looking at the clock at 4 am, blinking in disbelief and wondering where the time went (just... one... more... turn!) and the random world generator means that no two games will ever be alike. im not exaggerating when i say that this is one of the greatest games of all time.",504.3

"this game well swallow hours like no other. absolutely incredible.",217.1
"its different from the previous civ games. not worse, just different. the old ones 1-4, were only really strategically challending, but civ 5 is much more tactically challenging. its still about the overall strategy of where to build cities, when, how and how much you want to expand... but in civ 5, you have to think a lot more about the placement of your troops. i like this change, and if you want to play each eras units in proper wars (and have the time to do so), a marathon length game is quite fun... but its going to take some 50-100 hours to get to the endgame!",244.6

"hours of fun. very strategic, which can be daunting for first-time players. however, with a few games and maybe some online strategic help you can pretty much grasp how to play more tactically. once id started playing with friends, i learned more about how to co-ordinate your civilizations and how use their abilities and the resources around you to your advantage. id recommend taking a slow approach, and focus on culture victories to lengthen the game and make it an overall more immersive experience. military victories can just be downright irritating, especially for other players for a number of reasons. dont expect much from the ai. from the few games ive had involving them theyre either too easy or far too annoying, usually ending in their genocide. buy it! especially if on sale! get the special edition with the dlc if possible. everything up to, and including bnw.",80.0

"as a massive civ fan, this game was a bitter dissapointment. i wanted to love it. but i cant. a great interface and some cool innovations dont cover the many flaws. ill be sticking to civ iv i think. however, if youre new to 4x games, this is a good place to start. civ v has a much smoother learning curve than any other game in the genre.",433.3

"simply an incredibly engrossing game. compared to rival series such as total war, civ 5 is wonderfully accessible; the interface ensures that youll never miss available actions by queueing them, and the at-first complicated map is quickly made understandable thanks to a comprehensive encyclopedia and advisor system. while i cant comment on the accuracy of the language the world leaders speak, they are all visually well represented, having clear, fun animations when you decide to trade with or declare war on them. the soundtrack is suitably evocative of the various world cultures, and a gamut of settings for maps and variables ensures the even if you tire of the unique scenarios or the main game, there is always the option of creating custom matches. strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys historical and/or nation simulation games.",144.0

"what can i say about sid meiers civilization v? it is seriously one of my favourite games to date. it is an amazing turn-based strategy, that does not feel like either genre! you slowly build up your empire untill your number one, or you get left behind, choose one of the multiple ways to win, whether its world domination or the magnificent space race. i feel like anyone could play this game with or without your friends and still have a great time. wait did i say with your friends? yup it has multiplayer. as you are building your civilization why not invite your buddy? where both of you get to compete with your friends to see who is the better conquerer! i hate turn based games, but this is great game that everyone can enjoy! p.s. and remember, dont trust ghandi :p",15.8
"overall, civilization 5 is an excellent game. its graphics and overall gameplay would make anyone that likes strategy games love this game. you can play it with friends on multiplayer and servers are easy to set up. the only thing i dont like are the dlcs, which are exspensive. nevertheless i highly recommend this game its one of my favorites.",43.5
"civ 5 continues to top the rankings because of its dynamic replayability. take control of over thirty civilizations and attempt to forge for own empire is awesome. since maps are randomized, essentially every game is different yet exciting.",626.7

"this game is very interesting and addicting. many aspects of this game are from history and you are the one making it. it is also educational and fun to mess around on.",2.3
"having played previous civilization games, i found this one to be extremely satisfying. not only can cities defend themselves without a unit inside, which was problematic in some earlier civs, but the dlc for this game is actually worth the price. the faith, the spies, the tourism... such small tweaks turn a good game into an amazing one.",131.3
"awesome game!!!! cant wait for the next one to relsease.",126.3
"wonderful game. on linux (both arch and ubuntu, 64bit) works like a sharm! sometimes, i get the network disconnected when im launching this game and some progresses are not saved or steam cloud storage doesnt work, but the game is funny and requires attentions.",55.1
"it divides friendships, its incredibly fustrating, and you will almost always loose. but no other strategy game compares to civ 5; no other game is as varied or as enjoyable as this. the sheer scale of freedom within this is what makes it so good. its an absolute must play for just about anyone.",150.3

"get it deffinately!! this game is very addicting. i have playe it for 60+ hours, and i have never gotten bored with it! this game will lag a little when pressing next turn, even in singleplayer, but thats the kind of thing that cant be avioded (the game has got to catch up). over all, this is an amazing game and everyone should play it. the multiplayer is especially fun, because you can chat with you friends, and how you need to defeat greece with cannons, and how you repeatedly put tading posts over all over your land until your cities start to stave. id say, if you dont hav this game, you should. if you can get it when it is on sale, then you weil get way more than you paid for. you will play this for at leas 30 hours, lways trying to kill that last unit, or take that last city. plus, if anything else, you can show this to your history teacher :p",77.2

"the screen shots of this game does not do it justice. ive over looked this game thousands of times until one i thought i might pick it up. i was not disapointed! this is possibally one of the greatest strategy games i have ever played. it is highly addictive and best played with friends in my opinion! i had to get all the dlc for this game and they were all worth every penny i spent. single player in this game is very fun. when you first get into a game for the first time it can be very overwhelming but you cna learn how to play very quickly and once you get use to it you can crank up the difficulty and make it even more fun! buy this game if you love strategy! it is a must a buy for strategy gamers!!!",209.7

"i could speak volumes about how much ive enjoyed this game, however, ill try to keep it short. 1) this game is the standard by which all 4x games are currently measured 2) this game and skyrim are the highest quality games ive played in my lifetime in terms of pretty much every metric there is. i will give this one the edge on balance over skyrim though. (yes i realize they are 2 separate genres) even if youre not sure how you feel about strategy games i would suggest this one as a great starting point so that at least the frustrations of poor design dont mar your initial experience and you can truly decide for yourself based on the gameplay whether or not you are a strategy fan. i wish more game developers could uphold the standard of quality that civ 5 exhibits.",582.6

"one of the most played games on steam since its release. it is one of my most played games on my libary. absolute 10/10 if you like strategy games. make sure you get the game with all the expansion packs or else it will feel like it is lacking content. if you dont know you will like the gameplay, just get the demo first.",251.8

"over all civilizatiohn v is one of the best, most addicting, and at times most frustrating games i have ever played. the concept is ideal and the variety is awsome but unless your willing to go out of your comfort zone you will get bored. try new maps and civs, your stylke might always win but it might not always be fun. other than a bit of lag and lack of servers, online is fairly promissing and mentally stimulating, given you have the right players agaisnt you. single player isnt as realistic as i expected but what can you expect out of ai who have to counter your every move. all in all i give it a 9.2 out of 10.",45.5
"sbootiful if you like taking turns and taking over the world!",35.6

"fantastic game. a strong contender for the pen-ultimate strategy. need proof? this game is four years old, with two expansions at two and one year(s) old respectively, and is still on of the most played games on the steam network. between the large amount of dlc and the endless library of mods there is little to be left wanting from this game. in the end, with modern graphics and a more polished ui it is a strong contender, if not a guaranteed, to be the best in the series. it may not be complex as the the first couple of iterations, the more streamlined gameplay leaves for a more widely applicable and fun stlye. if you have any interest in turn based strategy, get this game, ask questions later. give it time, it may take a while to get the hang of it.l",498.5

"wish it had the civ iv sound of it. baba yetu, and leonard nemoy but great game still similar no stacking of units like in iv, the expansion packs are worth it also. the scenarios are hard, and the achievements are (good luck) impossible to get them all.",315.4

"its on sale, so just buy it. a game thats been worth its price over and over. with each expansion its made the game better and more interesting. with so many ways to play it now, its well worth the few bucks it is to buy it.",205.6
"although it may fail at simulating history, civilization v makes it up for being a deep and highly addictive turn based strategy game. if you only have the base game, the game will have some rough edges and frustrating features, but both gods & kings and brave new world improved the game so much that it made itself one of my favourite games of all time. the many options and resources this game has may overwhelm anyone who is new to the game or the genre, but all these options give an immense amount of fun and unique strategies that makes every game unique. together with an always randomly generated map and ai opponents with all different strategies, causes this game to never bore and wish you could play this game till deep in the night.",410.6
"civ v brought me back to the civilization series after a long hiatus of being unsatisfied with 4x games after playing the hell out of sid meiers alpha centauri and finding the successors and competitors lacking. there are some issues with attempting to play a very warlike or expansionist civilization but the game forced me try new 4x strategies to fit into its rules, a good thing. the expansion packs are great and offer novel new game play mechanics. highly recommended.",61.9

"outstanding game, nice strategy game and the game requires an actaul thought process. dont be put off by the turn based system its what makes the game awesome, the system allows you to make decisons and take your time or you can speed up via pressing the turn finsihed button quickly.",9.9
"so ive had alot of time with this game, its the most played game in my library and i have 131 games....im no good at reviewing games so im just gonna go ahead and tell you to buy it if you havent do so already. best game ever. 15/10",747.6
"my first steam game, purchased on release god knows how many years ago. i will likely play this game until civ6 appears.",373.5
"incredibly clever strategy game, offers tons of achievments to unlock, and lots of civilizations to play as. :o this game is much more advanced than those only with war; here you must focuse on currency and sciense while keeping your people happy. :o if you really wanna try a challenge, play one of the many scenarios available as dlc. :d this game is a 10/10! get it now! ps. new expansion packs are being released...",468.0
"civilization v is definately worth buying because of the amazing graphics, re-playability, and the turn based tactics that can captivate you for hours.",58.3
"for the strategist player out there, civilization v is a brilliant game, with many customisables and random worlds through each playthrough, with 4 main victory types, made even better with the dlc packs, adding religious, further diplomatic and reconnaisance aspects. overall, if you are an action gamer, look elsewhere. for the strategy players, get this. and you can always drop a nuke on someone you really dont like *cough* *poland* *cough*",56.2

"really good turn based stragety game, live europia in terms of potential difficulty, but ith a faster pace. you can change to game to the point where the settings are enjoyable for example cranking up the game pace, or if you like to play europia style slow it down.",114.4
"sid meiers civilization v, after recently purchasing the game with no previous knowledge of the series, i found if really easy to get into, greatly addictive game!",53.8
"really liked the game, however it is worth taking not that the recommended settings arent always the best ones. i chose recommended and i got through to the renaissance era and it crashed when i recieved the spy and i lost my progress. i found a way to fix it by selecting another graphics option but it was a bit too late and it ruined the fun. since then however, ive been having a lot of fun on there.",79.6
"this game is very emersive and makes you want to play more and more.",164.2
"addictive and interesting strategy game. although ive heard that it only started to bloom after the release of the brave new world. only downside is the lack of a campaign and a scarce selection of scenarios. multiplayer is easily the greatest though.",202.9
"no words can explain how great this game is! 11/10 :d",22.2

"i could say so many thing about this game, like how addictive, interesting, entretaining and fun it can be. but it would take a lot of time to talk about every aspect of civ 5 that makes it awesome, so im just going to tell you that if you want to play something incredibly good in your computer and get away of all the common or mainstream games, there is no better game than sid meiers civilization v. p.s. buy the dlcs they make the game even cooler. and seriously you cant play this game without the brave new world expansion",24.9
"three rules to the game... 1. invading people makes everyone hate you and you cant take them all out fast enough 2. trade is king and making friends wins games 3. gandhi will drop the bomb if you let him (dont trust) 10 atom bombs dropping on gandhi out of 10",44.7
"i do not recomend this game.. but only becouse you have to have steam to play it. i have had nothing but troubles with steam. it seems to always need to update itself exactly when i do not have a internet conection, or a poor one.. so the time i have to play is wasted by it updating...",931.5

"i am a big civ fan and have enjoyed all the previous versions. this version how ever i think is one of the best ones of the series. its very nice graphics go well with the wonderful music. the game can be very overwelming to people who have never played civ, thankfully civ 5 has a very in depth civ advisors that can help you get use to this game. from complete new people to the series or people who have only played a little civ. this game is a must have. you will be drawn into the game in just a few minutes.",156.8
"better combat system than civ 4, more wonders. miss the ww2 scenario though! the hexagon grid system makes it possible to form a proper defensive line and through holding strategic positions it is possible to hold of a larger army. the culture part of the game is also better than than ever. with tourism points you have to manage your production of great works in order to get combo points, adding more management to the game.",197.8
"a complex game that will keep you hooked for hours of fun!",158.6

"totally worth buying. i never played any turn-based strategy games prior to this and i always assumed they were boring. this game changed that view. i just started playing this game and so far im still playing with the bots so diplomacy is rather boring (the trades with bots is absolutely cut-throat). other than that, this is a very solid game. balancing your resource to attain victory certainly isnt easy. for whats it worth, this game is an absolute steal!",117.1
"a frustrating game entirely. i am first expected to choose a leader of a civilization where i dont get to really choose my ruler, i dont get to choose my colors, i dont get to choose my abilities or traits. then im thrown into a world where my diplomatic choices are almost non-existent, im forced to rush to special units which may be completely pointless in about 30 turns when suddenly we are in an entirely different age. i had hoped that alliances, trade, and the foundations for any real civilization would be present in the fifth version of this series, but no... you are expected just to spit out as many units as possible and vie for military domination-- which most other 4x games do much better. 4/10",20.0

"you will fall asleep playing this game, wake up, and continue playing it.",460.5
"this is a great strategy game that offers a surprising amount of freedom even if there are only a few viable strategies on the path to victory. mods arent compatible with the mac version unless you mess with the code. multiplayer, especially on a local network, is the best thing ever. barbarians can be infuriating, especially when they appear in the modern era. ive never been a huge fan of turn-based strategies but this one destroys my life.",77.5

"i cant start the game... i press play on the steam menu i choose the recommended directx 11 and what happens is a black screen pops up and then closes instantly... when i choose directx 9 the same thing happens, no errors pop up and i belive all my system requirement are met for the game. any help??",3.3

"always been a civ fan and couldnt wait for this game. sadly it was a bit bland and slow, but it seems the staff changes have made all the difference with the last expansion pack brave new world really picking up the slack. its like they just threw in everything the fans wanted. the mod community is amazing, i couldnt play without mods now. some of the fans have done a great job to enhance what is already a really fun game. if they keep the cutrrent direction the new civ games will be great. ...just one more turn...",184.1

"this is truly a game which gets better the more you put into it. on lower difficulties it can seem a little pointless with you easily steamrolling your opponents but as soon as you ramp up the difficulty and the ai starts to really hit you strategy and diplomacy take over and the game comes into its own.",41.0
"excellent game. various options and long playing time.",117.1
"never really played civ games, but picked this up during the summer sale a few days ago because so many friends play it. have to admit it has been quite interesting and as a major history buff myself have found the game play and information quite intriguing. definitely recommend this game especially if you can get it on sale. spent like 6 hours straight last night that just seemed to fly by, always the sign that you either have a gaming addiction lol or are having a good ol time playing!",386.7

"complete edition: almost a masterpiece! the only problem i have is boring, strategic ai, that makes me completely feel like im playing by myself. thankfully, the rest of the game is so wonderful that its easily worth the purchase! and surprisingly the new mechanics are so easy to learn, which i was intimidated about before playing. yes there is multiplayer, and yes during the regular waking hours there are people willing to play (if you set your steams region to a big city in the real world), but multiplayer on med-large maps is unplayable as people bail out off the game 90% of the time. what would have kept people to play was an official world-wide tourney ladder & visible scoreboard. a true 8/10 buy with confidence on sale.",96.9

"this game is so good on the 20 hours ive played i had so much fun. the reason why i dont play much is because i perfer the multiplayer but my friends never wanna play it so in my opinion: 8/10",18.4
"great game, best strategy game on pc. you can play as many great empires and civilizations of the world, from the mighty romans to the us of a. youll lose hours of your life going throught hundreds and hundreds of turns building your military, making a unique culture, making new strides in scientific discovery and worshipping the gods of, well, whatever. its your game. buy this name now.",317.8
"the game is great but steam will not open after a year, be careful. it requires an internet connection to keep verification, but steam does not have a phone number for service. when you ask it a question it gives you only a faq response. not helpful.",281.4
"civ 5 is a great turn base strategy game, where you build an empire, and fight others or be peaceful and try to avoid war with others, or be a person that expands there country.",203.9
"awesome turn-based strategy with loads of dlc, definetely one worth playing!",223.7
"as addicting to me as civ 2 was back in college. i think about it, i dream about it, and i totally dont trust napoleon.",30.6
"one of the best games on the market at the moment. can run on low end machines and looks fantastic on high end ones. if you dont have it, i suggest you pick up the gold edition to add to your collection.",40.9
"a highly addictive game that youll have difficulty putting down at the end of the day. even the quickest matches take several hours to complete. dont fool yourself into thinking thats bad, though! the more you learn about how to play this amazing simulation game, the harder it is to keep track of the hours passing by. just...one more turn...",215.2
"in has minor flaws but its an otherwise perfect game",193.7
"i went on at 10am and didnt come off until 6pm. its that addictive!",97.2
"its ing civ, what else is there to say? my only advice is to buy the dlcs as the base game is sort of empty... and broken. but other than that its a great game, especially with friends!",200.8
"one more turn. thats what you will keep saying even when you know you have to stop. be it total world domination or establishing diplomatic alliances, civilization is the foundation of empire dynasty building throughout the ages. the feeling of going from a group of settlers with only sticks and stones to reaching for the stars in their rockets is still not lost in this 5th outing. with new crisp and easy to distinguish detailed graphics this game is nothing but superb.",15.1
"fun, quite easy to learn strategy game. the game is fun in singleplayer, but becomes so much better in multiplayer where you can destroy all of you friends wonderful cities :d, also the dlc are must have because they bring so much more to the base game!",120.8
"a very excellent game, the gameplay is quite fast especially with a 180 second turn timer and quick combat enabled. it provides many many hours of gameplay and fun. i also recommend watching a quick youtube introductory video before your first game to get the basics or to play with a friend with current knowledge on civilization 5 or previous knowledge on previous civilization game(s). 10/10.",73.7

"civ = strategy. civ v = best strategy ever. go. buy. now.",150.5
"this game is as addicting and fun as the previous civilizations. the new ranged unit system is enjoyable and adds a whole new layer of strategy. any fan of the previous civilizations should pick this game up immediately. although if you are in school or college, do not pick this game up before any exams or tests. you will fail, but youll conquer the world!",86.6
"this game is awsome! if you like me waited a very long time before buying it, wait no longer! this is a masterpiece.",53.0
"i played this game for over 300 hours. if you like stratigy games, this is the one for you. 345 game hours and i still get fun out of it. millions of achievements and cards(if you collect those) it is worth every penny.",371.9
"time consuming political game, is what it comes down to. like a turn-based ages of empires but with intelligent political ais. played it for over 40 hours in 3 days of getting the game.",67.4
"great gaming experience, dont play marathon games or you will be up late every other night =)",465.9
"of course civ 5 is a great game... im just not convinced that the expansion is worth the cost. the price is quite high for what seems to be such a small amount of content; and the things theyve removed or tweaked entirely annoy me (good-bye culture bombs). i suppose a lot of the changes happened for game balance, but to change game fundamentals that long after release? a little sloppy for me. still, over-all, its a great game - id just wait for a goty edition, or for gods & kings to drop in price.",654.9
"awesome game! one of the few pc gems out there so dont miss out!",67.7
"sid meiers civilization v is a fun and addicting game i would recommend buying gold edition because that is the funest package. make the greatest civilization in history. it does need more dedictated servers though",153.0
"the best civilization game yet! offers countless hours of gaming, because after you beat it you can still play an entirely new game with entirely new scenarios. definitely one of my favorites.",97.9
"do you have no life and yet want to control the lives of an entire clivilization? if yes, then this is the game for you. another great installment of the sid meiers product line.",207.8
"despite the cost of the extra dlc if you are unlucky enough to not get the gold edition, civilisation v is one of the best games i have ever played or will ever play, in fact i originally got the game by less than legitimate methods but i enjoyed it so much i decided that i would pay for the full gold edition; an almost unmatchable great decision in my gaming life. the addition of new content steadily keeps the game fresh and exciting with the ability to lose yourself for hours. a great game and an even better addition to your game collection.",46.6
"once you add on the gods & kinds and brave new world expansions, the game comes into its own as the definitive civilization. ive played hours and hours over the years since its been released, and the depth really comes out in the more difficult settings. by far the most-played game in my library, and unlikely be eclipsed by anything else in the foreseeable future.",316.8
"a great strategy game! one of my favorite game ever!",422.7
"definitely my favourite turn-based strategy, and this instalment is a huge expansion over its predecessors. id recommend getting the expansions too, as they develop the gameplay and provide more ways to conquer the globe.",80.0

"france seems to have it out for my blood >.> but this is a great game!",79.9

"this was a very nice game, until i played with conner. my capital ;n;",106.4
"i bought the gold edition (the one that inclues all the dlc packs) when it was on sale for $12 (usually worth around $50). the last civ i played was civ 4 and it was decent but needed alot of work. i saw my friend playing civ 5 a while back and it looked pretty awsome and jumped on it when i found this one on sale and i do not regret my purchase. i havent had much time put into this game but so far i love it, each game you play is different and nothing is the exact same. this is one of those games where it seems like youve been playing for an hour but then look at the clock and realize that 3 hours have passed. great game, would definetly recommend even if you cant afford the gold edition. if you love stretegy games then this is a great one to try out.",63.6
"this game is great, i didnt play the game vanilla much, but with a few dlcs, the game was all i could ask for. single player would satisfy you forever, but multiplayer makes it that much better. fighting or teaming up with you friends can conquer the entire world.",100.2
"really fun and addicting game, games take a little long though.",41.9
"good game if you got a buncha hours to kill or got friends to play with.",180.4
"friggin fantastic gameplay. good game to play if you enjoy patient, long, in depth games. long term strategies are paramount in this, and it also tags quite a nice list of dlc for everyone to add content and alter gameplay just enough to keep your interest. also a necessity to for turn-based strategies!",222.7
"buggy game with mods. but enjoyable when it works.",66.9
"while not a grand strategy game on a par with paradoxs stuff, it will still scratch any itch you have for turn-based strategy. you will also sink more hours into it than youre proud of (you will be a little proud).",68.2
"an absolutely amazing game. you do kind of need the expansions to make it worthwhile, but with them this game is easily one of the best strategy games out there. thanks to the many different victory conditions, you can seriously play this game for hours and hours and still find a new and interesting way to play.",422.5
"21 hours in 4 days! i think im addicted. this game is incredible, a must play!",219.3
"there is a reason this game is my most played steam game. just sayin. gods + kings and brave new world are totally recommended, but if you play base civv first you will appreciate their additions to the game all the more. no game is ever the same, and this is the most accessible civ i have played.",271.3
"very fun game, the vanilla game is good by itself, but the bnw and g&k expansions make it beastly. better than any similar game of this decade",205.7
"i havent plaed it dlc free but with gode and kings or brave new world it is amazing",208.6
"highly addictive and strategic gameplay. civ v will consume your soul if you are not careful. try not to think about invading persia for extra oil reserves while you are at your job.",299.4
"this is the second civilization game i have played and i must say it is the best one. i also played civilization revolution but this civ 5 is better than revolution. civ 5 is more complex and requires you to think more than revolution.",29.2

"civ is awesome please buy it i played it for hours today :d",311.7
"fantastic addition to the civ series, cannot wait for the next one!",63.0

"take over the world, capture workers, and nuke cities. 10/10",272.6
"one more turn syndrome is a real, debilitating affliction. the only cure is to go for a science victory.",324.2
"this the best way for killing time!! time flies away every time i play this game. the environment is detail and colorful. and one i like so much is we can achieve victory with multiple ways. whether is with war & domination, with culture expansion, or diplomatic approach. we can embargo one nation and see it crumbles by itself. or we can just send the atomic bomb right away in the enemys capital. with the lastest expansion, we can even spread our religion worldwide and gain influence in world council (uno-like). very recommended!!",131.8
"dont worry baby is only smells. 9/10 would buy again",587.4
"deep,addictive and fun thats all you need in a game",264.0
"civ 5 is a huge improvement on civ 4, both in mechanics, visuals and gameplay. i feel it is more friendly towards the first time player. the additions made in the brave new world expansion pack make it by far the best in the series and one of my favourite strategy games of all time.",249.9

"are you a major nerd for history? turn the tables and brew your own history. as japan, you can own london and berlin. as american, you can be communist. build maccu piccu next to tokyo and dominate with a giant space robot. space is the limit in this world, dive right in.",152.7
"yay, more obsesive civilization building goodness! i wanna build all the wonders in one city!",108.2
"an addicting turn based game and a sequel to the past civ games.it came out just as i expected just as nice as the last ones but with better graphics and mechanics i look forward to the hope of future civ games! good job",46.3
"great game, the core experiance is fun but at the same time challenging. it also has many fun mods that can be added to increase the enjoyment of the game. with the endless amount of countries you can play in the game it is worth its price",130.8
"this is a great game. its pretty hard to learn, but once you do its really fun.",19.0
"this is an absolute must for any gamer who uses their computers with any kind of regularity. a lot of intricacies of previous games has been removed (unit stacking) with out diminishing its depth of detail. each expansion pack is worth every penny adding a whole new way to play the game from religion in gods and kings, to trade and tourism in brave new world. civilization v deserves a place among the worlds best regardless of genre.",260.1
"dominated gandhi and george washington in the same turn. 11/10.",147.3
"tacking on the noobs part kind of nullifies the whole gg part",100.8
"very good game, especially if its just one those sick days where you cant get off of the couh, very time consuming",135.0
"wonderful game, the best installment since civ 2. hugely addictive and the long games can really take up so much time. a must for stratergy fan gamers.",276.7
"every want to take over half a continent, or name all your cities tick? in this game you can, as you strategise on the plan for your civilization, wether it is building the notre dame or conquering every civilization in sight. it is rather hard to finish a game, one game can last for hours. i rate this 8 curries out of 10 curries",71.6
"i bought this game and played a match. its been 15 hours so far.",20.9
"this game is one of my favorite strategy game! like c&c!",237.5
"i recommend this game on its own merits, having not played much by way of the other civilization games. however, civ 5 works really well for me and i thoroughly enjoy it. good systems and mechanics for tile improvements, city building and improving them, etc. with each expansion it fleshes out more and adds new systems to enjoy and explore. basically, if you like strategy games, this one will give you a lot to see and do, and its pretty damn enjoyable while doing it.",498.9
"if you are looking for a game to spend hours upon hours playing and not even realize it, this is the game for you. visually its stunning and its a ton of fun to play. war is tactical, no longer stack attack until you win and city/empire management is wonderful. 5star in my opinion :)",228.2
"as good as the previous civilizations, with added tabletop like stradegy & format giving it a better feel, flow, playstyle and better graphics to boot.",584.7
"this was my first real civ game, and i love it. the brave new world expansion adds a lot of complexity and a lot of interesting elements to keep the game interesting. ive definitely sunk way too many hours into this game, but its one of my favorite games to binge on. the game takes a lot of time to play, but because it is turn based, you can (supposedly) save at any time and play more later. i enjoy this game for more than just the style of game. i appreciate the historical information woven into the game, and i like that i can play this game while listening to or watching something else. if you like slow, tactical games, i would recommend giving civilization v a try.",344.3
"this game is one of the best games that i have played. i deffinately reccomend it especially if you love stratigy. i love to play this because i love stratigy (without stratigy i would be a mindless thug playing call of duty no offence). me and my friend think it would be the perfect game to play for geography in school because it has some geological stuff in it (dont steal this idea or unless you put my name in for example thank you ethan/behemoth for suggesting this). deffinately play it and maybe even challenge me if you dare and yea. recap deffinately play it challenge me if you want and watch my youtube (soon going to be uploading civilizations once i fix my recorder)",32.1
"i love strategy games. civilization is the leader of the pack when it comes to turn based strategy games and civ v is a worthy successor to the series. the brave new world dlc is a must-have expansion - it feels like a new game, not just an expansion pack. enjoying the broad options with civilizations and their unique abilities allows for much replay. overall - the best turn based strategy game available.",145.2
"i can lose entire weekends in this game. its a must have.",387.6
"this game is greatly time consuming which would be the only real flaw to the game if you were to ask me. overall the gameplay is smooth and is fun, really wish you could make the game a bit more fast pace and the fact there was no single player story line was kind of dissapointing. great time waster if you need that, is really fun in multiplayer and single player. great variety of playable historic people.",24.5
"this game is pretty damn addicting. it certainly has its flaws: its a bit simplistic once you understand the fundamentals. but there is enough content to keep me coming back to play",264.3
"great game. played hours and hours on it by myself and with friends.",65.8
"absolutely love civ 5. even though it is lengthy, it is definitely the best turn-based strategy pc game ive ever played. the mechanics are beautifully mastered, and the gameplay so smooth, you wouldnt even think it was turn based.",78.5
"so far have about 40 hours on this game. not much to say other than it is a good time consumer and lazy-one-handed type game game. good to play when you just want to chill, get comfy if thats your thing, and attempt to take over the world. dont think about it that much, go with the flow and build/take paths in the game that interest you. also, this is a really fun mutliplayer game. get some friends on skype and play a game, it will be the most fun youve had with friends in a while, trust me. ive been a turn based fan forever and if your into fire emblem or advanced wars and your not palying this game then your doing something wrong. go get it and nuke some cities and",71.2
"you start out totally uncivilized and in like 3000 b.c. this game is . i was expecting civilization.",1.9
"honestly one of the most addictive games ive ever playd, 10/10 :) with all the playable civs all i can ask for is more! :d",80.8
"highly addicting game.. keep telling myself just one more turn o_o very fun and highly recommended",168.5
"best game to play while doing other things. i have enjoyed this game since the first one came out (used floppy discs to install). play this while miniature painting. love turn based games.",124.6
"never before has gandhis personality been recreated as faithfully as in this game. declare war,  es. stay classy, gandhi!",139.2

"very addictive, if you are free from midnight to 6 in the morning then buy.",84.4
"you like good turn-based games? you prefer staying at the computer all day? well, civilization v is your choise now +good gameplay +pretty cheap now +add-ons are really cool! new civilizations and game mods are included. expansion packs offer a variety of new features +multiplayer (players vs players or players vs bots etc.) -expansion packs are much more expensive than the game -civilization v without add-ons becomes boring very quickly so if you have some spare time and 2-3 friends playing this game -buy it!",110.0
"i remember playing civilization ii when i was younger and enjoyed back then. having since learned a great deal more about civics, history and cultures i know enjoy this game much more.",243.0
"over the years (and the expansions/dlcs) this game has become better and better. the one-more-turn-feeling is hard to resist and this game is as deep as it gets. i highly recommend getting the addons, as they really add to the experience. also, civ is often on sale, so that shouldnt be a problem. this game offers hundres of hours of gameplay youll love, if you like turn-based strategy games. by the way, i think that its kind of odd that people who spent more than 500h with civ claim that they cannot recommend this game",370.3
"i heard from other people that this game was a bad game compared to other civ games, and i was hesitant to purchase it, but when i noticed it was on sale for a very low price, i bought to try it out. i now take back anything bad i ever said about this game because playing it is the most fun ive had in a strategy game since civ 4. the military mechanics are now completely different from the previous civ games, with only one unit allowed per tile, which isnt a bad thing, just different. after playing this i find it almost impossible to go back and play civ 4 and 3, its almost as if theyve lost their appeal. either that or this game set the bar too high, and makes civ 4 and 3 seem somewhat subpar.",477.2
"awesome turn based strategy game, not my favourite in the series but definatly a must play.",196.2

"the perfect balance between complicated and playable, the dlc is a must though.",203.0
"this is a game where you will spend hours playing. you will neglect to eat, sleep, or even go to the bathroom just to watch your country grow and prosper. if you have 5-7 hours to spare, this is a great time sink.",383.4
"love this game! its a must buy! the expansions add so much more and it is an amazing game! 10000000 out of 10",535.3
"it is a great game for gamers and strategists everywhere. fun war/stratagy game where you build a civilazation for the ages, as a certain person representing a place, such as agustus ceaser, who represents rome. every nation/civ has 2 special units, and one special ability. rome has a balista and legions. speical units replace regular units, such as a greek hoplite. it replaces a spearman. then there is the tech tree. it takes you through the ages with new techs, like a frigate in the indusrial era. there are a few eras. they are: ancient, classic, midevil, renassance, industrial, modern, and finaly, future. this game also has cultural paths or techs, which help you with wonders, soldiers, trade by rodes or sea, happiness, food, and much more. that is why this is a great game!!! civ 5!!",160.4
"this game is for everyone no matter what, you could be 10 or 80 and still love it! 2nd best game i ever played",138.1
"new graphics, new people new units, same great game !",245.6
"any game that can make you spend 100+ hours withoug completing a single game and having a good time whilst doing it is good by me. although at times i do wish that the combat system was a tad bit better, just something personal though as combat is still very strategic and very rewarding.",150.6

"a really awsome game i only with all my friends could play this also!!",39.0
"epic game. if you like strategy games you must have it,but you have to put up with lots of waiting turns until it gets interesting",98.0
"simply amazing. for people new to civilization, this is a very intellectual and complex strategy game that never seems to get old. one playthrough is fairly short but i come back to it about once per month and play another. you can also customize the games so much that every time the game is a little bit different and i would challenge anyone to beat it on its hardest setting. for fans of the civ series, i believe they keep getting better. graphics improvements are great but i like the unit and tech changes, i would highly recommend it. also, the leader screens are a lot more involved and interesting. sadly they removed the city view but have the city change dynamically on the map. they also removed the throne room. not sure how i feel about those but at least they put spying and religion back in, in the expansions. definitely worth the money.",155.2

"one of my favorite games ever! no strategy game has made me think as hard as this one. with so many things to micromanage and decide it makes 10 hours go by like nothing. a 100% good buy for any strategy lover.",235.7
"this game is great, endless fun for those who enjoy rts games.",23.7
"oh, sid meier, consumer of so much spare time. civ 5 is no different. things have been streamlined from the earlier games, and the ai does a halfway competent job of managing things so you can ignore some of the minutiae of running a vast empire, but you might not want to anyway. empires need to be focused tightly in civ5, so the sorts of things that work for large empires wont work for small ones, and vice versa. one thing civ5 does really well is variety, and theres so much of that. so many civs, abilities, units, ways to build/manage your empire... the fifth installment takes everything you loved about the older civs, keeps that stuff, and adds new stuff. its just a wonderful game.",103.4
"great rts that has different ways to win. deffinatily would see myself investing many hours into this game.",159.4

"warning. this game is potentially dangerous and illegal. im not sure how sid meier was able to sell this pure cocaine. **** this game is legit, its a strategy game (+1) has many different ways to play and  but is so addicting. playing with friends for 4+ hours straight and only have to come off due to tiredness, not boredom. 10/10 would and should buy again.",200.9

"i was one of the first to buy this game in 2010, and i was also one of the first to stop playing this because i, like many others, felt it was a watered down version of civ iv. however, with the two expansion packs that seem lovingly crafted by firaxis, the game is easily one of my favorite 4x and strategy games of all time. the end-game was brought to life by bnw, and g&k fixed all the ai concerns i had. if you like strategy games at all, buy this game.",60.6

"to anyone who hasnt played the civilization series, i definitely recommend it. building whole civilizations and destroying others, while choosing your path (militaristic, cultural, etc), building wonders, are a few of things that make this game addictive. the mechanic of having fairly short-term goals under a main longer-term goal makes you forget time and this is the game that inspired the termone more turn. :d",151.3

"this game can be incredibly fun when mixed with skype, multiplayer, and ideas.",113.9
"a good game if you get it on sale. civilization 5 introduced many new mechanics that i found very welcome, hex based tiles, one unit per square, but unfortunately took away multiplayer modding. you cannot play mods in multiplayer, i cannot stress this enough. what made civilization iv so great were the mods and this game just does not have them. a very unacceptable oversight. crappy launch but the game holds up ok now. especially with the two expansions. however, even after the expansions civilization 5 continues to have graphic issues with texture popping and still has a poorly optimized engine that will be a burden even on some higher end systems.",389.5
"freaking awesome and if you like this game then invest in rome: total war (either 1 or 2)",55.0
"this game is one of my favourites in my library. its a game for anyone that loves or likes geography, it teaches you about history and lets you mold history in your way. i recommend you play this game with friends, you can play online and solo, but its a little more fun with someone you know and like to play games with. i recommend this game! 9/10",71.5
"what an awesome game! a great game even for those new to civilazation with a great tutorial and helpful hints that you can set to walk you through the game in the beginning or that you can completely silence once you become a world ruler! the gods and kings expansion is well worth buying! it adds so much to the game, new civs, buildings, and ways to play the game. i dont see myself getting tired of this game anytime soon with so many options, new civilizations to play as, many difficulties to master and so much world domination to be had! if you dont like this game... well you must be crazy!",40.6
"civ v is a really fun game because it is like alternate history and i like history. if you want to have a way more in depth experience of alternate history then check out one of paradoxs games. but if you want a simpler game, then civ v will be a fantastic game for you. :)",507.0

"im a big fan of sid meiers franchise since sid meiers civilization ii. this fifth of the series is for me, another big success. i spend many hour on this game and im not tired of it. some people prefer the third or the fourth of the series but this one is not soo bad. in fact, with its last brave new world extension, sid meiers civilization v is one of better strategy game that you can have. once you begin playing, you will never stop. i guarantee. ;-)",42.7

"seriously, what do you need to say about a civ game. awesome.",85.6

"when you go to play this game you will think you will only play it for awhile. you say, oh only an hour or two and then im going to bed. im not saying that you will be up half the night playing this game, im just saying it should be bundled with a coffee maker.",9.2
"in my professional life, i am a political scientist who studies political violence and international relations. i have spent many hours in this game for both fun and creativity. i love seeing how gamers choose to engage in a variety of foreign policy decisions in multiplayer games. civ 5 can teach us quite a lot about the average world leader, and it can be damn fun at the same time.",251.4
"one of the best turned based games ive had the pleasure to play. it runs well though i have had more crashes than i hoped for. the game is fun with friends but can take a lot of time but you can always save it. the only problem i have with (apart from the crashes) is that to fully enjoy the game, you will have to get the dlc, gods and kings and brave new world. though its worth it.",175.3
"great game, still playing for hours per week. still miss some of the features of civ4, like slave states, etc. could really use some additional diplomatic options (like demanding surrender, slave states). and what i havent encountered yet in this version, in older versions if a huge empire lost its capital, it split up in two adding a new nation to the game. would be nice if that feature was also introduced again, or in case of unhappiness for a long time, certain cities rebel and form their own nation (which is actually how many nations were formed).",312.4
"this game is fun. slightly addicting. sometimes frustrating. but still, i like it!",74.7
"best strategy game, easy to play, difficult to master.. i only wish, that ai is more predictible. it feels too much random, actions are without consequences..",303.7
"civ v is an excellent strategy game. the civilization series has always been amazing, but civ v takes the franchise several new notches up. by using hex tiles instead of the strategy-industry-standard square tiles and by eliminating the unit stack, battle tactics are more realistic than ever before. and speaking of realistic, the graphics are absolutely phenomenal. beautiful art deco theme. so yeah, get civ v!",82.7

"having played all civs, since the first, i think the mechanics introduced in civ v is amazing. im playing with gods & kings and i think the tactical options makes this the most interesting civ game ever to wage war in.",118.2
"since it was released in late 2010, firaxis latest instalement in the civilization series has been improving until it finally reached a point where its possible to say its the best turn based strategy game ever designed. first with gods & kings and the scenario packs introduced new units, buildings, wonders, religion and espionage, but now with brave new word comes so many new elements that enhance the gameplay experience (specialy in the late game) that its almost possible to consider it as a new game itself. nine new civilizations, eight wonders, eight buildings, twenty units, two scenarios, new gameplay mechanics such as trade routes, ideologies, the world congress, an improved cultural victory including tourism and archaeology. playing civilization v without this expansion will simply be impossible.",339.4
"would totally reccomend this game to anyone who likes a good strategy game. be sure to get gods and kings as well as brave new world to help enhance the experience!",85.6
"whether youre an old school civ guru or brand new to the series, like myself, civilization 5 delivers engaging gameplay through key choices made during every campaign. tread diplomacy lightly as to not incur the wrath of larger, more powerful civs, or go balls to the wall militarily. i guarantee if you play long enough, youll ache to win as many ways as you can. gods and kings didnt quite fix diplomacy, but the game is directly better because of the dlc.",477.9
"i have sunk so much time into this game since i bought it in the humble bundle. i would recommend it to anyone!",412.9
"ive played strategy games my whole life and this is the most complete game out there. replay value is very high, pro tip - save often...",215.7
"what can i say, civ has been amazing for over a decade!",435.7
"one of my favorite franchises of all time, civ 5 has brought a lot of new and exciting content to the table, and a boat load of changes to boot. while some changes are better than others, the experience of building your nation, fighting for land, trading for resources, and the over all global experience is something great to be a part of. if you see that im online and not playing this game, assume ive been kidnapped and im trying to signal you.",59.9
"this game helps with strategy and lots of planing through",15.1
"this is certainly one of my favorite games. i admitt that it can take a very long time to play a single game, but i feel that adds to the fun. true you dont get the stacks of doom any more. now the player needs to spend more time on tactics.",515.1
"this game totally jacks with my brain. im such a nerd for you civilization, youre mathmatical!",168.5
"great strategy game, clean, good graphics - awesome!",298.9
"i know people will hate me for this, but civ v is the best of the franchise--especially with the addtion of brave new world. i appreciate that everything is more directly meaningful and less micro-managey (if thats your thing, id say stick with civ iv).",42.6
"having played civ 4 alot, i did initally really enjoy this game.... but eventually the game got to repetitive for me and after a game you look up at the clock and wonder where did all that time go? the reason fo rthe game getting so long is probably atributed to the amounts of units you aquire by late game, making it almost a chore to move your armies around every single turn!!! all in all its a pretty good game, it just has some glaring flaws that can piss you off after awhile :/",90.0
"i have lost too many hours to this game, but its all been worth it. this is hands down one of the best strategy games out there, if not the best.",210.4
"i would greatly recomend this game for anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games. youll find yourself addicted to it in a matter of minutes, trying to become the worlds most cultural and military dominate empire. if you are not a patient person however you probably will not enjoy this game, because it takes alot of waiting and planning before you make your next move.",117.3

"the base game, when first released, was pretty tame compared to the much loved civ 4. gods and kings (gold edition) made this a good purchase, brave new world brings it up to the standard weve come to expect of the series. some pretty big changes in this installment, including hex based maps and the end of the stack of doom, albeit replaced with the blob of doom in some instances.",126.3
"hope you dont have a family or social life if you play this game.",573.9
"this game- for little i have to say im terrible at it. but one thing this game did was impress me with its overwhelming amount of features, ive only scratched the surface! this game seeks to amaze me and delivers which is why it gets a seal of approval. i rate it around 5/5 (perfect score!)",66.1
"excellent game, many hours of play time. brilliant turn based strategy, most fun when played with friends. like risk? of course you do, this is longer, more complex and more fun. for more and longer reviews go to",115.1

"one of the best strategy games ive ever played! get the dlc as well improves the playing experience.",240.0
"this game is a perfect play for any youtuber/streamer to do a long stream on. each game is around 6 hours long and is tense every minute of it. this game provides the player the perfect control over a country and grow it to the top. it is a turn based game that requires strategy all the time! you start out at around 3000 b.c. and play until everyone gets blown-up or until the 330th turn! rate out of 10: 8.9",344.7
"this is by far one of my favorite pc games of all time. the reason i think this game is so good is that it never really gets boring, there are so many mods for the game, and its so dynamic, its just really hard to get actually bored of this game. to top it off, it has great graphics, which in all honesty arent really required for a game like this. i might be a bit biassed of course since i love all of sid meiers games, but this one really takes the cake, i would recomend buying this game to all of my friends.",183.3
"this game is hours of fun! each expansion pack adds a new demension to the game making it even more fun. this game can make you easily forget that there is a world going on outside your computer room. the game is awesome to play with friends. best installment of the series thus far. endless fun.",316.1
"awesome game just dont know why i cant play direct x 11...",38.6
"sid meiers civilization v is a beautiful masterpiece of a game. the vanilla game alone is good, but when you see the number of things that you can download on the workshop or make yourself, it transforms it into an immense, content-packed game. there are mods to fix things, to add whole civilizations, to add maps, to completely overhaul the game itself, and many many more, and if those dont appeal to you, then with a few hours of using the sdk available, you can make your own scenarios, mods, and more. tl;dr:a brilliant game made so much better by the huge amount of content available.",486.3

"civilization v is the best civilization yet. they introduced a number of new features like hexagonal grid (excellent for strategies) and improved graphics (3d animations with enemies leaders are just awesome) and a new multiplayer online. the basic version is pretty, you know, basic... it has something less than civilization iv: there are no religions, no ideologies and really too few leaders and scenarios; the only scenario ive had with the basic edition is that of gengis khan. however, buying one (or both) civs dlc (gods and kings / brave new world), you have all the features you were missing from civ iv and much much more! civilization v (with dlcs) is the best 4x turn based game you can find and the huge workshop (and of course the sdk) gives you a level of customization in the gameplay that you never had before!",305.0
"i bought the gold version and my understanding is that when youbuy any games gold version it includes all released dlcs whereas, i bought it and it did not come with all released dlc so therefore i will recommend this because i enjoy it but i will not recommend buying the gold version because it did not come with all dlcs",26.7
"im not a strategy game at all. however, i think civ v is one of the more accessable strategy games, which made it fun for me to learn and play. prepare to spend a ton of hours playing games. this is also one of those games where its actually kind of fun to relax and play against the ai. of course you can also play with your friends, which is just as fun! there are a few bugs sometimes, but the game is absolutely stellar. i would highly reccommend to get the gods and kings expansion, as it really does smooth over combat a lot. still, the base edition is very fun.",117.9
"ive played every civilization game and every expansion; with civ 5 brave new world, theyve finally achieved a balance of victory conditions that transforms this game into the only strategy game equally suitable for single or multiplayer that genuinely offers opportunity for victory with whatever strategy you choose, provided your choice is clever and adaptable.",493.9
"if you like real time strats then this is your game its a fun strategic that is even better with friend its an epic game of building,defending and destroying its a truly epic game 9.5/10",86.1

"fantastic, watch the hours of your life wash away before your eyes as another classic civ sucks you in. even better with gods & kings.",289.7
"one of the only games for which i buy expansion packs with no resentment. civ is worth every $, and frantkly a lot more than that. workshop is amazing for this game, and has every mod you can think of. civ 5 improves gameplay significantly over civ 4. while some veterans have trouble adjusting, in the long run the changes are for the better. ai players remain competitive to the end, unlike old civs where one nation dominates to the finish. i only wish i could make the game go faster. no matter how much i overclock or upgrade my pc, a 16 player game on a huge map just starts to slow down near the end.",847.0
"a good enough successor to civ4. some things it does really well, like hexes. other things i miss from civ4, like its significantly harder to field an army, and enemy cities are significantly harder to attack now. if i outnumber him 5:1, i should just win. but no, one unit per hex, so not everyone gets to attack the same turn... makes combat slower. graphics are beautiful. no more leonard nemoy narrating. :(",386.5
"200+ hours of playtime cant be wrong. and there are so many ways to play this game.",244.5
"crazy fun with a few friends, and just generally a great play.",206.3

"136 hours in and still loving it. cant imagine it ever being boring.",397.5
"this is hands down the best turn-based strategy game i have ever played. as soon as i got into my first match, i knew this game was amazing. if you ever sit around and say if only i ruled the town/country/world things would be better! nows your chance to prove it by ruling your own town/country/world. will you be a ruthless tyrant, or a shrewd diplomat? will you destroy your neighbors, or peacefully coexist with them throughout the centuries? its your choice. thats what civ 5 is all about: you shaping your empire the way you want it.",149.3
"do you enjoy turn based strategies? do you want to lose days (im not ing kidding) worth of productivity as you scream out your anger at barbarians and ghandi? then this game is the game for you. everything you have probably heard about the game is true. there is a ton of gameplay and deep mechanics behind this game, and a plethora of gameplay difficulty choices to match your playstyle. i have spent countless of hours playing this game (and civ iv as well). definitely worth playing if you enjoy the genre! this game is not pc friendly, so be sure to have a decent gaming box in order to play it. 9.0/10.0",354.0
"civilization v is a very wel l made experience that will literally provides days of gameplay! with your friends, or running solo, the stories you create with this game are very well worth it.",50.7

"when you have no time, this is a good game to play. with a massive selection of civs, maps and dlc, hours can be put into this game to never be seen again. difficulty ranges from super easy to trying to take russia during winter. each civ has unique units, abilities and their own personalities. great fun.",181.5
"deep and fun. hard to put down. once you start a match, youll be hooked for hours and maybe days, before it ends. it has tons of gameplay depth, different things to pay attention to, and no two matches are the same. besides, theres steam workshop and a lot of mods of every need!",190.2
"sid meier is in top form once again, and the civ series has reached its apex with this title. completely worth the time and money investment, and the best entry in the series since civ2, in my opinion...",18.0
"beware: do not start a game of this unless youve got atleast 3 hours of free time, it is suer addicting. that being said, i absolutley love this game! i was apprehensive to buy this at first because i had never played a strategy game before and didnt know if i would enjoy it. well i did, its very easy to get started with with different difficulties, locations, leaders and other variable that affect your playing experience. it also has great controls that are simple enough for anyone to uderstand. the graphics are gorgeous and the ambient music that accompanies the gameplay is a nice little bonus. bottom line: buy this game! this is a great introduction to strategy-based games :)",43.5
"turned based strategy is fun when you dont have a lot of time to play in one sitting",35.5
"hmm, maybe ill just play a couple turns...omg its 4:00am!!! this how this game works...youll start playing and suddenly its 6 hours later. not terribly difficult to get into for people like me who dont have any of the previous civ games, but quite compelling to play. they really need to work on the multiplayer. it is functional, but theres no animations, and you have to do some workarounds to save and reload a multiplayer game. just to update my somewhat dated review... the incomplete multiplayer features have been fixed. multiplayer is just as functional as single player. i still play civ v, and i still enjoy it, so it has withstood the test of time!",254.8
"sid meiers (why is his name all over this?) civilization v is honestly one of the most fun turn-based strategy games i have ever played. if you have any interest in ancient cultures, i would highly recommend picking the game up. although it may feel rather simple at first, the game has a surprising amount of depth to it, and the multidue of victory conditions make almost any playstyle viable, once they have been fine-tuned. civilization v is not fast-paced, wont get your blood racing, and likely wont satisfy the gamer looking for a hardcore experience. instead, civilization v serves as a nice relaxing game that gives you time to think, a relaxing escape to wind down after a long day of work. just dont start playing right before you have someplace to be, because you will get sucked in to playing just one more turn. before you know it, its 6 a.m. and you have to go back to work.",419.4
"sid meiers civilization v is a really nicely created turn based stratagy game. you will find your self playing the game for long 8+ hour periods as you expand your empire. i only have 200 hours on this game and i am sure i will get loads more. my only issue is that i would say the base game is somewhat lacking. its still a good game but could use more, so if you are intrested on getting the game i would reccomend the gold edition as it comes with some new civs and g&k wich is an amazing expansion. the other expansion bnw is also a fantasic addition to the game and recomend you pick it up also.",296.5
"great strategy game. control your country to achieve victory by any means necessary. war, science, diplomacy, etc. you decide!",515.1
"best turn-based 4x strategy game, even better with g&k and bnw",134.5
"while civ v has been the subject of much criticism from the series long-time fans, dont let their silly words of anger distract you. the civ formula remains intact in this latest game, and many of civ ivs clunky elements (i never liked religion and espionage) have been removed. additionally, wars are now much more fun and tactical to fight thanks to the one-unit-per-tile restriction despite some glaring (but still relatively minor) flaws introduced by the concept. the only things i can name as negatives are the rather stripped-down multiplayer (which i dont play anyway) and ridiculous dlc prices. just forget about these, buy it, then set an alarm clock because you *will* lose track of time.",171.7
"a game that fails to justify its very existence through sheer lack of innovation; and that doesnt say when that started. one of the most overrated games of the past several years.",71.7
"definatly an upgrade for the series, having seen the issues that civ 4 had with balancing. this game really updates the classic franchise with detailed visuals, a clean art style and much smoother animations during the combat. speaking of which the combat has also been improved with no more stacking units on tiles (meaning that you dont end up having an entire army crammed into a single segment) making placement of your units much more important. i havent really found anything to complain about its a good solid addition to the series. would reccomend, especially with freinds.",38.4
"buy this, its amazing, you can kill gandi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",385.3
"sid meier has been providing excellent turn based strategy since the release of civilization in 1991. civilization 5 is no different. civilization continues to expand upon this great franchise. i recommend everyone gives this game a try. visuals- 90/100 gameplay- 95/100 audio/sound- 92/100 overall- 92%",147.0
"let out your inner world leader. great time killer.",63.0
"the best game for those who want to take over the world. civ 5 is much more tactical and strategic than its predecessors, requiring players to have the mindset of a general rather than a mathemetician. a wide variety of civilizations and cultures to play, with highly customisable, randomly generated maps forces players to adapt strategies. mod support for civ 5 is extensive, with always something new to try. i highly recommend getting all of the expansions, because they add so much more to the game and make it a truly amazing experience.",240.6
"never thought i would be caught dead playing a turn based game. worms 2 was the only one i had played and the inneraction and smack talk with my friends made their cartoon antics more than delightful. i do not play this for the same reasons as i usually play alone. it is a challenge to myself to beat every leader and keep getting more leaders to distroy. i so wish obama, and other 20th and 21 centuries would be made into a pack..... i so want to take them down.",515.5
"this game is a massive time sink. its not uncommon to lose 3-4 hours in a single game. its got great graphics and really sucks you in. any one who has played the other civs knows what theyre getting into. combat has changed from civ 4, which in my opinion, is really the only negative here. very solid game.",122.9
"this game is great, i still dont know how to play this game and yet is not frustrating",1.4
"with brave new world dlc, this game has truly became the god of turn-base strategy games. if you owned civ 5 already, bnw a must-have dlc. just imagine all your epic experinces playing civ 5 in the past, with this dlc you could easily multiply them by x10. this expansion basically fullfil 90% weakness that civ 5 ever had like boring peace-pursuit gameplay, buggy multiplyer gameplay, lame diplomacy etc. and add many more kick- features such as tourism, more policies, enhanced multiplayer mode, rebalance civils etc. go get it now, civ 5 owners!!!",421.9
"its the newest version of civ. cant really go wrong. this one is more streamlined for new players, but keeps the core gameplay of the previous games.",6.7
"the civ series has long been known as digital heroine. civilization v is no different. despite some ling complaints i have with streamlining the user interface, this game is undeniably an amazing sucess. the hours will melt away into days!",59.4
"this game has been immeasurably improved by its expansions and is absolutely worth getting",218.0
"best turn-based large scale stratagy game of the current gen. the expansions add a lot and are worth the money (if they go on sale). play on a higher difficulty and challenge yourself. have not tried multiplayer very much, so i cannot comment on it. but as a single player time sink, its perfect.",128.3
"civ 5 is really really good. unfortunately so was civ 4 and the streamlining and simplification of civ 5s systems dont quite make it a worthy successor. if youve never encountered the civilisation games before civ 5 is the best entry point, but people familar with the series may be a bit disappointed with the omissions and simplifications civ 5 brings to the formula. better with the expansions, but still not quite the evolution of civ 4 that you might be looking for.",10.0
"what you got here, is a fantastic turn based stratagy game. the civilizations to play are diverse in playstyle, from the warmongering aztec to the trade centric arabs. the gods and kings add-on brings even more to the table, with a massive game changer: religion. the brave new world add-on will revamp the culture system, and tweek current mechanics. get it and all the dlc that come with it.",661.5
"this is an extremely addictive game. there are dozens of different civilizations that you are able to play as, and each of them have unique benefits over eachother. be aware that this game is very time consuming, and if you are not the patient type, this may be a boring game for you. (my first game took about 30 hours) overall it is a great experience that you shouldnt miss out on.",110.7
"strategy masterpiece. well balanced, expansive, addictive and thoroughly replayable. really feels epic, like you are nurturing a powerful civilization from its roots to world domination. highly recommended.",129.8
"addictive fun that will cause you to sink hours of your life into it. the gradual but constant progression means that you almost always feel like your about to reach a stopping point in game resulting in you playing just one more turn and before you know it its morning. advised not to be played if a deadline is coming up.",674.7
"the best 4x game of all time. also the best at empire building. nothing really come close. eu might have more depth and complexity, but this one is overall bette produced and more accessible and it does not feel like work.",159.8
"not everyone was happy about the changes from civ4 to civ5, primarily the end of stacking units and the hex-based maps. i think it was a massive improvement, and it is further improved by a very active modding community. id be very cautious about buying any map-pack dlc; the game has a wide variety of map types and specifications already. the dlc packs that come with new civs are usually worth your money. one other note is when they push out a new expansion (gods and kings, brave new world) it takes the modding community some time to catch up to the changes. if you have a favorite mod it might not make the leap to the next version.",370.0
"for strategy lovers , this game is very addictive and easy to play, curve learning hour +/- 2hours.",31.9
"this is the perfect strategy game ever created...yet. civ v can be incredibly relaxing as you take a huge  time planning and thinking about each turn. or it can be as mindblowingly intense as you watch your own hand crafted civilization fall to the hands of your long time friends (both ai or irl).",126.5

"great strategy game for everyone. and by that i mean you can make it either super easy or super hard or a really quick match or a really crazy long match that could literally take days. whats not to love!? its also quite amazing to see your civilization go from hut dusters to mech riders.",28.7
"its civ, 5, which is like 5 civs, you should civ with the 5 civs because its civ, and that is that. really, if you have somehow managed to remain entirely unaware of the civilization series, for what like almost 20 years at this point... just... buy this one and figure it out. the combat and end-game can still be a little tweaky but its still one of the best game archetypes ever created. now if you will excuse me, i have to take one more turn and go to bed..... ...... ...... ...... ...... <alarm clock blares at 7am> ... . .. . damnit! x.x (9.9828471491523902845/10)",54.3
"first new release i bought on steam, well worth the money",186.6
"if youre a fan of the civilization series... youll love this one. theres many new civilizations, city states, and other challenges.",72.7
"although the gameplay has been drastically overhauled, civ v is a huge improvement from civ iv. no longer able to stack units, and cities have a base defense value (modified by garrisoned troops or defensive buildings), civ v caters more to the long-term strategist rather than the spreadsheet wielding histobuff. the graphics are much more pleasant, the ambiance retaining the worldly civalization energy that has evolved over 20 years to manifest in this, the game of life.",271.4
"this game brings real time strategy to a whole new level. this game is a must buy for anyone who likes rts games.",724.1
"if youre a casual civilization fan, or if youre just someone looking for a good turn-based strategy game, look no further; civilization v is a great game of this genre, and youll have fun with it. if youre a hardcore civilization fan, you might want to avoid this game, as it is significantly less complex than previous civilization games. for this reason, it was somewhat controversial within the civ community. still, im of the personal opinion that its worth a buy; if youre uncertain, simply wait until its on sale.",94.5
"one...more...turn...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. problem: several of the steam achievements appear to be broken. the game itself is fantastic (definitely go for gods and kings - the extra features are certainly worth it).",58.4
"a really addicting turn-based strategy game on building and expanding your civilization. it offers hours and hours of fun giving you a rise of plans to conquer the world. this game willl keep you saying just one more turn.",79.5
"its like chess with more buttons, good timewaster, but almost too tedious as the games can be rather long or chase-worthy without a good partner and nemesie, can get strategically heated but moments are too far in between, still a good experience.",58.2
"the expansions were pricey but ultimately this is one of the most solid strategy games ive played, as well as one of the most immersive.",217.6
"amazing game. goes very in-depth into establishing a civiliziation and being able to sustain throughout time.",67.4
"civ 5 is in my opinion the best civ made so far. all fans of the old and newcomers will spend many a day playing one of the most adictive games known to mankind. you may play many civs such as england, russia, germany , america and many more and each game will will be very different to the last. this game gives the meaning one more turn a wild new look. you may not call yourself a master of turn based strategy untill you have played civ 5.",448.2
"interesting game, very well done. i strongly reccomend this game to people who like strategy!",417.1
"civ v is the most comprehensive strategy game i have ever seen and with the steam workshop it makes it more fun than ever.",617.7

"great game. challenging at times but always enjoyable.",248.5
"get yourself some hot coffee and clear your mind. youll engage in many manly businesses if you ever decide to open this game. time consuming and lots of ways and strategies to win. but one thing will remain throughout your 100h+ career in civ5. fun and individuality as nothing will remain the same in all your games. except ghandi. damn you, ghandi. protect your settler. please protect them.",322.1
"i said to myself around 2 hours ago, just one last turn. sure enough, 2 hours later: oh man i almost have this city creamed! just one more turn!!!",18.0
"this game ruined my life, ive spent countless hours playing this game in the hopes that one day i will control the world. many nights spent awake sitting on this game figuring out what the  do research agreements do. 10/10 game.",533.5
"superb strategy game. plenty of interseting mods to make the game even more unique.",248.1
"fun as any civ game, and graphically beautiful, and as with any civ game, you can walk away without worry of explosions.",181.5
"after a rocky release in 2010, much of the problems with the original release have been addressed with the expansions god and kings and especially brave new world, with the addition of trade routes, religion, culture victory overhaul and policy overhaul, and the world congress amongst other things. if you did not like this game in its original form, its worth a second shot if you get the expansions.",478.6
"this game is amzing!! hands down, it is one of the best strategy games out there!!",324.4
"one of the best games ever played, is so fun with friends but is also fun on single player. the long hours put into one game makes it very rewarding once the game has finally finished what i love about this game.",33.8
"best rts game ever. first one ive played was tzar, and that was a long time ago. this is so much better. 5 stars",114.2
"an unrelenting addiction. if you have important deadlines approaching then for the love of goodness dont start playing this game. however, if you have a few weeks worth of hours to spare, you will soon learn the joys of conquering the world as a vengeful gandhi.",78.9
"just... cant... stop... playing... one... more... turn... then im going to bed/work/eat",186.5

"this game is amazing, got it for my birthday. awesome features in perspective to civ 4",32.9

"great strategic game. some wierd bugs, but i guess my biggest complaint would be how mch the expansions cost...",74.1
"ive got over 50 hours played but the funny thing is, is that ive only sat down to play it maybe 8-9 times......so lets just say i developed the wait one more turn then im done disease. you will too i guarantee.do yourself a favor and just buy it.",56.2

"civ v is one of those games that you cant really say no to. as a turn based strategy made by the famous sid meier, this game lives up to the name of civilization. although ive encountered a few, but rare bugs in the game (such as a ship magically jumping into a lake from the sea) this game is a game you cant put down, you spend hours on it because you want to see what happens in just one more turn, what you can accomplish. 5/5 id say for this game. i recommend it to anyone from every part of the gaming spectrum",30.3
"deep strategy, awesome community mods, awesome game overall 10/10",275.9

"our words are backed with nuclear weapons! -gandhi",70.3
"excellent strategy game that you can get lost in for hours. disapointed in the fact that nearly all the multiplayer servers all require you to have the dlc brave new world ( a ripoff in price). other then that good game.",42.4
"this game is awesome and it will keep you busy forever",95.5
"i enjoy playing civ, and even though i enjoy it, matches can take a good while, even on quickpace turns. new tech would go down well along with a new range of different civs, and maps...even a sandbox map maker would do me too.",148.1

"why isnt brave new world under gold edition? add that and this game is perfect.",12.5

"im new to turn-based strategy games, and i really love this. granted, i mostly play against the ai, but it can still be very challenging. i like that i dont need to form a group before deciding to play. and when i do play with friends, its a fun race to see what will happen.",444.8
"once spent 16 hours in one siting, winning, only to be nuked by gandhi and lose. 10/10 would spend another 250 hours playing",327.2

"ive played the other civs and this one is a big improvement. if you liked the other civs or just strategy games in general you will like this.",27.1
"a well-known and well-respected strategy game, this civilization simulator really puts you in the mindset of the leader of a society, from its conception in the ancient era to the future and beyond. remarkable attention to detail coners this game, from authentic languages for every civ to accurate archetectural styles for every civ throughout the ages. a great game for strategy fans, history buffs, or anyone whos ever wanted to rule the world.",94.6
"definitely worth the purchase, the gold edition expands the game extensively and allows for endless replay",111.7
"this game can suck you in so much, its kinda scary. the game has a few technical problems (wrong textures on certain pieces of the map, the ai takes a while to process turns in larger games) but it is still and excellent game that warrents your attention! it has a great modding community as well, which can help keep the game fresh as you go through it. the massive expansion packs (specifically brave new world, which at the moment this review was made, is the latest major dlc pack) also change the game completely, with bnw making the game as far as i am concerned, better than civ iv, which is pretty hard to do as it was my favourite up to that point. do yourself a favour and buy this game, you will not regret this purchase!",675.3
"ive put as many hours into this as i have put into a lot of modern rpgs. that says something about how addictive this game is. i would even be willing to go so far as to say that this is the best game in the series. while some of the changes (such as removal of unit stacking) are annoying at first, everything leads to a sense of greater balance than ever before and the need to figure out new strategies. the graphics are fantastic, the tech tree is well-developed, and the civilizations all feel just different enough to make you come up with different play styles for each one. id definitely have to recommend this game to any fan of turn-based strategy games. whether you are new to the series or a long-time fan, civ v has a lot to offer you. definitely check it out.",247.5

"the classic continues to be great.... just one more turn! lol.",364.3
"so much time lost in the infinite turn cycle that is civi v..",277.9
"civ v reminds me of one of those crazy german board games in the best way possible. there are some smart improvements in here for newcomers to the series and the hex grid system works perfectly but it never captured me in the same way civ iv did, its just a tad too clunky for my tastes. nevertheless civ v does everything right, if youre looking for an endlessly replayable strategic experience then you should look no further, civ v is the best in what it does.",86.9
"great mechanics with lots of replay value. any strategy fan will enjoy what civ v has to offer. the expansions also add lots of content.",25.4

"okay im going bed after one more turn.. (three hours later)... im going bed after one more turn..",186.6
"civ5 has a good range of dlcs and the same is turnbased. the game is very good for a long time if you are bored. the game is best with friends and very easy to connect to each other. i havent had any problems with this game. it is a very easy game to play you will learn quickly and sometimes it gives you a challenge. the game itself is around 20 but there is a gold edition which is 20. the gold edition gives you bnw (brave new world bundle) and other things. i love this game but you need to commit to the game you are playing or you will lose the game. rating 8/10 or 4/5 stars! rated by mrouldy",157.7
"pretty good game, if you do not play with frank g.",161.2
"ive been out of the game for a while now and recently got back into it after acqurining it in the christmas sale. i played a few hours in one go and boy oh boy is it epic :) if youre a long time fan of civilisation, youll enjoy this one all the while, lots of dlc brings hours and entertainment at a very reasonable price too!!",5.6
"this is a great strategy game. it is very addicting though. worth the buy in my book!",43.9
"great game if you have many hours to play. everything about it is what you can expect from a sid meier game and more.",22.0
"this game is about the only rts game i enjoy. the depth and multiple ways you can play this game keep me coming back. i highly recommend it. the only negative is you can look up at the clock and realize 3 or 4 hours have passed you by.",71.9

"yes however, a lot of maniupulative online bugs have been found",301.6
"ive played them all (civ i through this one) and i like civ v the best *now* with the additional expansions. the hex-based map is much better for realistic environments and movement. single unit stacking is also much better - no more soak-off attacks (where you have a stack of spearmen with one modern armor and the enemy kills off your spearmen one at a time while your armor remains unharmed.) it also makes upgrading your military units important because now it matters if you are holding a mountain pass with a single legion versus using a rifleman unit. beyond combat there are a lot of nice additions with diplomacy, religion, and civics that give you more ways to play and win (replayability is very important to me.)",82.1
"really awesome turn-based strategy. better than the original, with awesome strategic and tactical options, and great graphics. it has less replay value than civ 4 though, as after a dozen games you will fully understand all the nuances, and the additional downloads offer little of interest for spicing things up.",473.8
"this game is loads of fun single player, and even more multiplayer. 10/10 would buy again.",42.5
"this game became my life i play it almost everyday. i highly recommend this game, but be prepared to cancel all other activities. this game will become your everything start easy then work your way up. prepare to lose yourself in this truly amazing game.",241.8

"i bought and downloaded this game from your site and its glitching out constantly",452.8
"must...get...sleeeep! this games literally took over my life. the first turned based game i have ever played. this game is so complex, very rewarding though. if you enjoy history or simply enjoy the idea of creating a civilization and see how countries develop and react to certain scenarios than this game is for you. you can play a long complex game that will take you hours to complete or a quick game. i recommend you have a clock by your pc or you will lose track of time, kiss your loved ones goodbye!!!!!!!!!!!",103.5
"get the complete set if you can. not just the gold edition, but also brave new world. it makes the game a thousand times better. not that the vanilla game isnt good on its own.",238.0
"its not bad. the ai is basically psychotic and will *always* eventually seek you out and try to eat you. if youre looking for a war-free game, you will be disappointed. that said, if you keep a reasonable standing military its perfectly possible to win without nuking russia (but you probably will still want to. s.)",44.0

"takes alot of patients, but a very good game worth playing.",22.1
"just spent a goof 4 hours playing this, and considering the normal length of time id play a strategy game for is about 10 minutes thats a good sign!",50.3
"really fun game and the addons add interesting new stuff, so i recommend playing it with the addons.",155.9
"fun. havent played a game thats made me so immersed in a while.",42.3
"best civ game yet! the combat is more strategic because units can no longer stack on top of each other, so you must protect your catapults, flank with your horses, etc. the multiplayer is also really good, you can do co-op multiplayer vs. ai and save the game for multiple playing sessions. also, the multiplayer lets players who crash rejoin the game, which is pretty nice. overall, worth the money, youll play this game for many hours. get it and play some mp matches with me :p",357.0
"great game, but a bit pricy for the full pack. expecialy fun to play with friends as free for all style game, but good fun for solo evenings too.",237.8

"another installment in a series of good games, not only keepign with the same theme but improving some aspects of the gameplay itself.",74.9
"this game is truly a marvelous experience. it teaches me things while allowing me to have long battles with players and have loads of fun. it keeps me occupied and i am able to play it anywhere. the range of characters and leaders is huge and i cant wait for the next dlc update or for the next version",34.9

"very fun good graphics you can play with many freinds at once buy it!",50.6
"after 315 hours of game play, i would stronly suggest this game to anyone that loves turn based strategy games. another strong point is the modding community in which they must get props for their outstanding mods. vanilla civ 5 is a very good game in and of itself. i have played sid meiers games since the beginning and will continue to buy their products at release. they need to release civ 6 sometime in late 2014 if they are even thinking about a civ 6.",359.9
"some aspects are a bit dumbed down from civ iv, but the exansions will fix that and even exand on them. also combat is extremely improved, youll no longer lose attack helicopters to cavemen.",48.9

"i had never experienced being awake through the night until 5am. until i got civilization v. and despite my sore eyes the next day, no regrets.",112.7
"it wasnt worth the price i paid for it, but its still a great addition to the civ series.",10.7
"a good civilization game that changes/adds enough to the mix to also be its own particular experience. be advised that the two expansion packs (gods & kings and brave new world) are a must.",64.5
"not quite as good at civ iv in some aspects, worlds better than civ iv in others. im still a sucker for some empire earth or age of empires, but as for tbs games in general, civ v has a lot of moving parts, is a very involved game that can take days or a few short hours depending on rules, setup, and play style. good replay value. great with friends.",68.7
"this game is extremely fun and easy to get into. from bows and arrows to nuclear war, dirt roads to railroads and catapults to tanks, its fun to watch your civilzation progress. you almost feel a sense of pride watching your glorious empire rise and your enemies fall before you. you feel defeated and terrible if your grand civilaztion crumbles. this is just a great game to make your own story and alternate history. i reccomend this to everyone who likes creating your own story. 5 stars.",512.0
"this game is like crack, you always want a little more.",129.4
"good game overall, a bit repetitive at times but definitely fun to play!",139.4
"civilization v ranks in as my favorite pc game of all time, hands down. the depth, the strategy, and the amount of fun in this game while playing long matches that take several days just to complete is wonderful. there are so many countries to choose from and each have their own special stats and boosts. it takes a long time to be able to play at higher difficulties, but thats the beauty of it. the replayability is the highest of any game ive played. this is by far, a 10/10 game.",318.5
"so this game needs to be reviewed as it is one of the greatested experiences ive ever had in gaming. this game is smooth and true to the franchise in every way. the dlcs add and change so much they almost feel like a whole new game. civ 5 brings to the table a fantastic turnbased experience that i can sit down and play for hours. trial and error, new straegies, different paths you can take will completely changed how the game will turn out. smart ai adds to the games sense of running a real country in a real world. the single player on its own makes this game great but like many other games nothing beats playing it with a friend. if you have the money i reomend picking this game up with all its dlc its well worth a look.",198.2
"this is a great game. whether youre looking for a intense challenge, or just to unwind after work or school, this game will provide the experience you are looking for. i am not very good at strategy games, yet i have spent many hours enjoying the nuances of this game. the expansions add depth to the experience and there are many mods (my favorite being the song of ice and fire mod) which further add to the game. i would recommend this game to just about anyone.",390.9
"brilliant game. its an excellent time killer and its not hard to get a grasp of either. the diplomatic panel is smooth and pretty easy to use and the movement is basic but effective. 9.5/10",460.8
"this is a very entertaining strategy game. hours and hours of game play.",46.7
"before playing this game, my swag percentage was around 63%. after experiencing this icly sexy masterpiece of strategy gaming, my swag percentage reached the new height of 92%.",154.6
"i, when i first started playing civ, got into it because of historical what-ifs. but, through my constant playing, i have also begun to enjoy the game not just for the possibilities, but for the entire format and gameplay style. turn-based strategy games give you a chance to get better at thinking ahead, and how the game will play out in the long run. i highly recommend it to anyone interested in perfecting their strategy skills.",200.2
"buyer beware, while this is an excellent game, it is very addictive.",81.5
"i bought this game awhile back. the main reason i bought it, aside from meiers reputation, was the fact that its multiplayer. however, at the time, multiplayer didnt work well, so i only played a few times. hopefully thats better now, ill try to give it another chance soon. theres no doubt this is a huge in-depth game with tons of content. but as much as i love a good thinkers strategy game, im currently more into the real time unit games like dota or airmech.",35.7
"this game kicks, sims city, farmville, cityville, asses! if u like stradegy games this is the game for you!",211.4
"this installment brings what feels like a rebalancing of the battle and advancement systems allowing a skilled leader to upgrade their techs before their real world equivellent, before decimating their opponents on the battlefield. as someone who has been playing civilization since the beginning, i really enjoy what theyve done here. my only complaint is that some civs that have been around since the beginning (babylonians and zulus for example) are now dlc if you didnt start out with gold edition.",231.7
"a fantastic game with beautiful visuals and a fantastic play style. even if you arent much for conquest type games it is worth a try. controls are fluid and everything is written in a way that keeps the learning curve smooth. multiplayer is fun, but all animations are removed which is a downside. ps- ghandis a jerk. he will not keep peace with you.",49.3
"absolutely fantastic game, a litttle pricey but goes on sale often enough. expect to keep saying one more turn until you collapse from sleep deprivation.",51.6
"just pure amazing soon a new game of civ called sid meiers civilization: beyond earth i am excited for that so fall of 2014. but the game its just magnificent. i reccomend it with a 10/10.",293.7

"yo you get the masterplan going and you just go with it man you know what i am saying? powergame religion, money, culture, science, whatever, just play brave new world with friends.  hype.  ghandi, venice stronk.",100.6
"absoutly love this game. it has a playstyle that will keep you hooked for hours just wanting one more turn. if you have got 8 hours to kill i reccomend sitting down and playing this game.",141.9
"great game, still needs community support in the form of multi player mods.",238.1
"civ v is a slow-paced strategy game that has nearly infinite replayability. its even more fun if youre a history buff. ive played it vanilla, with the g&k expansion, and now with bnw, and these two expansions improve it significantly. i wouldnt recommend starting it up without at least g&k, its just a tad too barren without it, and religion is a really fun mechanism. dont be thrown by the initial complexity- civ is a game that will reward your attempts to figure it out.",343.2
"i recommend this game only is you like strategy games. otherwise you may find it a tad too boring (for lack of a better word). i personally love this game simply because of how time consuming it is. one game can takes hours even days to complete solo; great for making time fly by. when i first got the game, i never really played it that much. but when i started to get back into it, i was so addicted to the game. i would play it hours on end. if you did this too, you may even want to invest in its gold upgrade which includes all dlc (except brave new world of course). brave new world would top off your civilization v gaming experience if you are willing to pay for it.",142.2
"this game is not the most enjoyable to play on your own, as the computer can quickly turn on you and end a game you have been playing for hours just to be a up hill struggle and not to enjoyable at all. with friends though this game is a giggle as you have a human reacting against you. i would recomend it though if you find it in a sale.",16.4
"i spent 7 hours on the tutorial alone, constantly realising i hadnt fathomed the sheer depth of this game at all! so many possibilities, so little time... must play!",33.2
"awesome game. i accidentally played for 10 hours straight the night i bought it, sleeping around 8am. anyway, very addicting and versatile game",612.2
"great game thatll make you forget you were supposed to be somewhere hours ago.",269.0
"civ v is one of those games that you want to play a little bit after dinner and then you realize its almost breakfast. with all the expansions, this game is so vast, so varied and with so much written into it you wouldnt even scratch the surface 100 hours of gameplay later. i highly recommend it for people that arent strategy fans too  playing in an lower difficulty still gives you an enjoyable experience from end to end.",132.6
"think this series is one of the great simulation games especially civ v",43.0
"if you plan on getting this game, be warned, you will spend hours and hours of your time playing civilization v. it is so addictive, and has huge replayability, with 5 different victory types, and over 20 different civilizations to play as. definatly of my favorite games ever, 11 out of 10.",114.1
"the best game ive had in such a long time, woth the buy!!",84.5

"the pringles of gaming... dont start playing if you have any plans for the next 10 hours!",293.8
"the ultimate strategy with a huge modding community in steam workshop, if thats your thing. although military victories are ht major type of its kind, the customisation of scenarios and world types are very impressive. leaders are also a great part of it, both historical and comical at the same time. one could describe it as a a chess game(due to hexagonal movements) with more then 2 players and 1000x the amount of complexity. yet the game is still extremely accessible and , well for me, easy to understand. despite this, i recommend to have some experience in strategy games, such as xcom or total war. but if not, there is no better time nor place to start then right here ,right now",123.6
"awesome game. visually beautiful, strategically deep, historically informative, and leads to great stories. the day i bought this, i sat down to learn how to play it after hearing for years how great the civilization series is. when i saved and exited, steam informed me i had 12 hours logged. i paid full price of $30 (1/21/14) and its worth it so far and i suspect will continue to be.",106.1
"the most realistic elementary school friendship simulator on steam.",44.6
"i love it! simple to learn, but replayable. i havent even gotten around to getting brave new world because i am still enjoying the reular version, even though it is highly rated. this is like risk meets some tycoon game meets, uhh ehh... something completely epic! i am not exagerating. the only problem is that bnw is so higly liked that it can be difficult on occasion to find a multiplayer game.",351.1
"logged hundreds of hours on this game. tbs and even rts gamers will not be dissapointed.",512.7
"fantastic game, great amount of strategy, however the ai is ballistic and not very good, capping out in a difficulty at king, and just getting cheap starts at any difficulty higher. with that said, the game is still absolutely fantastic, and you can spend dozens of hours just going through a couple of turns, making decisions, trading, and managing your city to make it as customizable as you want it to be.",62.5
"incredible title! (although i recommend getting all dlcs) a easy to get into strategy game that oozes with fun. you never get bored whether you want to be serious and try to win or have a mess around randomly declraing war on every country it simply does not matter. i recommend waiting until a sale tho. the game with all dlcs (brave new world included) costs a lot if not on sale.",49.7
"awesome turn based strategy game! by far one of if not my favorite.",247.6

"this game is absolutelty fantastic, and has a huge replay value.",648.7
"one of the most fantastic games ive ever played. if you like strategy games and have a lot of patience i highly recommend.",49.5
"this is recommended! even better than prtal 2. you are capable of building a great country, and your goal: victory. i like the gameplay, graphics, and themes for empires. you should get dlc. (denmark,korea,polynesia, g+k, bnw)",487.1
"hey, ive got a couple hours, why dont i play a bit of civ.... oh god its already saterday",220.4
"great civilization. with the expansions (brave new world + gods and kings) its a contender for best strategy game of all time. just wish you could still get resources outside of your territory.",392.4
"i reccomend this game. like, a lot. its a great improvment from the previous game, and i really enjoy playing it. its just an awesome game. if youve liked this series or any games in the genre, i would recommend getting it. theres so much to do to stand the test of time.",81.1
"civilization 5 is the best civ game yet i like the game play",145.3
"one of the greatest strategy games... no wait, the best strategy game of all time",90.9
"dont get me wrong it is a great game. addictive, easy to play other than the intoduction critical thinking in this one. each soldier, achier, ect. can only take up one spot, so it can be tricky to take some citys. i personally play civ. iv most of the time, it is an all around better game.",151.9
"watch before your very eyes as entire day vanishes whilst you give gandhis swarm of knights a nuclear suppository.",171.1
"personally i am a huge history buff and yet i had never played any of the civilization games. i purchased it skeptically (after purchasing microsofts similar game) and was blown away with civilization. if your into history, great game play and fresh expansions (with a decent steam community behind it) - get this game!",24.9
"no other game quite matches civilization for the level of revilement and repulsion instilled in my partner whenever i play it. i say, one more turn, aware of the damage my lies will cause. she will say, ill leave you! ill call her bluff and hold out my non-dominant hand, looking away from the screen only between turns. shell plead, at least eat something! ill devour whatever meagre portion of food she gives me. assignments become secondary. work becomes secondary. life becomes secondary. holding your bladder for 15 straight hours isnt normal, on civilization it is. 10/10 would destroy life again.",316.5
"i really wish they would fix and/or fine tune some of the things that have been annoyances since the beginning of the series. like some seemingly minor, but incredibly frustrating, ai issues for example. but still, great game. 9/10.",172.6

"sid meiers civilization was one of the best game of this era and still might be if sid meiers civiliztion beyound earth is a flop which i highly disaprove (note this review was made before the release of sid meiers civilization beyound earh) i would giave this game a 9 3/4 out of 10",652.3

"best strategy game created since superman 64. the warfare and how everything works is spectacular, but it has seen better days when superman 64 was the king of games.",198.6
"addictive doesnt begin to cover this game, especially if youre playing with friends. the amount of time youll accidently spend simply by losing track of time is astonishing. worth every hour.",206.3
"still a solid game after so many years. cant wait for beyond earth.",52.4
"conquering countries? making allies? making armies? going to war? yes this game has it all and much more, being one of the most fun games i played. recommended.",38.3
"with brave new world, civ v has an entirely new set of gameplay features that incorporates new challenges to each game. theyve gone out of their way to continue to make this game playable, even for those of us who are veterans of the series. highly recommended for any strategy game fan.",602.3

"if youre going to get this game it would be best to do so with a couple of friends because it has an excellent multiplayer. although you should prepare for some very long gaming sessions! xd",273.8
"wickedly addicting. there is more content than you can imagine, and with a new expansion just around the corner expect to waste away hours and hours.",60.3
"got into a cold war with poland that lasted about 300 years and delayed scientific growth along with it. its 1997 and were still using catapults. 11/10 would waste life again",148.7

"id recommend this game but i gotta get back to playing it.",91.1
"just picked this game up, and this is the first one ive played. gotta say its pretty aweseome, one of those easy to pick up but hard to master type games. all in all, its good. i highly recommend this!",37.0
"da best game to play with friends even when u dont know how to play properly",277.4
"if youre a fan of previous civs or enjoy playing long multiplayer games, i highly recommend against buying this game. while very pretty, civ v is essentially a simplified version of civ iv and has much lower replay value. i can understand the design choices made with this game, in terms of attracting new players and maximizing profits, but it doesnt feel or play like an authentic civilization game; its more of a civ-themed reinterpretation of the genre, aimed at casual gamers. for the price, and having to pay extra for core game features carved into dlcs; this game was not worth my money, nor my time. back to a heavily modded civ iv i go...",149.7
"so good that you dont mind how long it takes to finish a game.",159.1
"civilization v is horrifically addictive in the best way possible. its the kind of game where you can spend countless hours playing and not even notice the time passing, which can potentially be very dangerous. it may not be the best game in terms of graphics and gameplay but if you have the patience to master it, it can be very rewarding.",43.7
"keeps to its classic heritage but with some fantastic improvements with the add-ons ive lost many hours on this great strategy",44.4
"great game! get it on humble bundle while you still can.",65.5
"its a good game, has nice mods to make it over into smac/smax but the $30 dlc isnt easy to swallow considering how half-baked they seem.",698.6
"quite simply one of the best games ive ever played in 35 years of gaming. for me, this is the best version yet. ive been hooked since i bought the first version years ago. if you havent played it yet, youre wasting your life. i could go on but id probably sound like a firaxis employee. get it now.",920.1
"amazing game almost no critique except the fact that it is quite boring to play alone, make sure to have some friends to play with. runs smoothly on my ok laptop.",16.4
"this game turns the phrase just one more turn. into the biggest 5 hour lie youve ever told. you will think, ill just fire up civ v and play a few turns before bed. at 10pm and the next thing you know, its 5 in the morning. even if turn-based strategy games arent normally your thing, you should still play civ v. its that good.",53.4

"this game literally is probably one of the best games i have ever played single player. it contains hundreds of hours of fun with the ability to play as your favorite historical civilization. i went out and got the 4th civ to try it and couldnt play because of how awesome civ 5 is. one downfall may be that the online doesnt really work too well so playing with friends isnt the best option. but if you look at this from a single player game standpoint it is a gem. i would recommend this to a friend and i give it 10/10 my most played steam game.",123.9
"great game, perfect example of 4x gaming now buy it and explore, expand, exploit, exterminate!",275.6

"still an enjoyable game. i like being able to set up the games and see how they turn out.",52.2
"honestly one of the best turn based strategy games out there. if you ever see civilization 5 on sale, i suggest you pick it up immediatly!",598.3
"it is my favorite of the series. it simplifies the game compared to 3 and 4 which was always a turn off to me. the matches will last a good 8+ hours even if its against a computer. 8/10 for me.",72.8

"this game teaches that the worlds leaders are . also, its nearly impossible to stop playing just...one...more...turn..!!",68.7
"alone ok game with the dlcs great game its a mass world conquest game and it will take you about forty hours to complete a campain so if you like having a lack of time and mass amounts of fun this is the game for you and im not going to explian what it is because its a commonly known game and if you really need to know watch a lets play of it or aj reveiw on it that will get the idea of what it is acrossed",67.8
"this version of civ is not as complex as its predecessors, but that is more than compensated for by the much more balanced gameplay that requires you to have a well-rounded empire. the ability of cities to defend themselves also rewards players who play defensively and constuct walls and other defensive buildings. the social policy system also adds a new dimension to the game that was missing earlier, requiring you to choose from a variety of options that offer rewards tailored to different strategies and scenarios. and of course, civ5 is just as addicting as all the other games and will keep you coming back for more.",235.0
"game is great,but since i got steam my pc gets to many pop ups.u suck steam.hope u see this .",98.5
"civilization v is the ultimate strategy-turned base game. why? well mainly because every single move, action, order or whatever has a consecuence in the future (might be instant or in another era). the different personalities of the worlds leaders vary from warmongers all the way to peace keepers and makes the atmoshpere of the game much more realistic in comparison to other strategy games. before playing this game i was a fan of age of empires, i bought this game because a friend recommended it to me, now i hardly play aoe since the game in general is so poor in comparison to civilization v. the different possibilites to play in this game are endless and go from capturing all the worlds capital cities to be voted as world leader in the united nations. in conclusion, civilization v is the best option for strategy games fans.",532.5
"had a violent war that killed millions with a tyrannical ghandi. 13/10 would recomend for americans.",185.5
"its a classic, just the newest time through. if you like being the leader, the one calling the shots... for seeing a plan or strategy come to life as you work through it, its a great game. and while on previous editions i never got around to it, multiplayer with this game and its expansions can be a lot of fun with friends.",210.3

"this game is awesome, but you absolutly need the brave new world dlc.",171.8
"dis gam ta bestt eva.. this game had me non-stop playing for a whole weekend. i recomend this to anybody really. unless you cant stand turn-based then this is the best game ever. 10/10 cities will destroy",49.3
"really good for wasting days when i should be working. if i didnt have this game i might actually have to do something productive...",181.9
"awesome game, had it for about a year and i love it! just one problem, for some reason i am unable to create a religion! otherwise this is the best game i have!",72.0
"the wee hours of the morning will sneak up on you while playing civilization v. highly recommended!",86.7
"alone, civilization v is a great game, but with its two expansion packs and all of its add-on content, its one of the best strategy games one could ever come across on the market. so, if you want the full civ v experience youre going to need to cash out atleast on brave new world, which in many ways is the successor of civ v, the rest is really just great for the content it adds and increasing the variety in civilization choices as well as the pre-set scenarios. so overall, civilization v is great, but its outstanding with that second expansion.",556.7
"greetings and blessing be upon you. will you build a kingdom that stands the test of time?",291.2
"very good turn based strategy with very complex elements.",9.1
"civ v brings the civ game to a whole new level of fun, however it is highly recommended to play with friends for the ai can be very predictable (predictable does not mean easy however) despite tech trading being out of the game the new features higly make up for it and turn the core civ gameplay into something much more in depth. civ v is a solid fun title and if you enjoy turn based strategy civ v is the game for you.",257.8
"great game of which is verry fun. getting started is not very easy but you get there...",2.3
"this game is great! i can spend days playing this game without getting bored, it keeps you at the edge of your seat with each moves of the ai or other players if you play online. very strategic.",47.5
"nuking england as gandhi. 10/10 would radiate earth again.",108.9
"awesome! just needs the multiplayer debugging and theyd have the best online multiplayer strategy game around.",932.8
"its one of the best games of his category. very enjoyable in single player but multiplayer is hard to play with others",112.9
"truly a great game. enticing multiplayer that can be saved and finished later. complex gameplay and deep strategy. the only con: annoying french.",34.3
"i dont think im very good at this game, but it is extremely fun. after watching some videos online ive started understanding things more and its quite entertaining. well worth the money.",88.6
"this is a great game, however with the expansion packs it is soo much better. i highly reccomend god and kings expansion, the brave new world expansion is fun but not as good as the gnk expansion. many reviews stated this game was not as good as previous version, and indeed the early versions of this game were not, however with expansions and update it certainly is a good game.",126.4
"a cool game exept that the ai is  but otherwise this is an awesome game",240.2
"very good strategy game, fun and addicting. you can play as many civilizations and there are lot of dlcs that adds additional maps, scenarios and civilizations.",90.1
"this is an excellent investment, if you enjoy single player turn based strategy games. its better than any previous civilization game, and the only thing it is lacking is playable multiplayer. the mulitplayer just takes far too long to play a game. its meant to be a single player game. its a deep and complex strategy game with a fun atmosphere. i will be playing it from time to time until the next civ game comes out. the only alternative to this that i would recommend as far as turn based is civilization revolution for consoles. its not nearly as deep but if you like multiplayer more than single, then you can play a game of civ rev in a reasonable amount of time for mulitplayer. this game is one of my top 5 favorite games.",141.6
"one more turn.... just one more turn... just one more-- oh, whats that? ive been here for four hours? oh well, im already running late, just one more turn shouldnt hurt... and maybe one more after that...",68.3
"this game is amazing! it is a very thought inspiring and creative game that realy makes you think how we have com as a species. i also love the historical aspects of it, giving you the opertunity to dive head first into the lives of ancient civilizations. 10 out of 10",594.1
"strategic, turn-based gameplay as famous battle leaders... i just can not stop playing this game!",59.2
"civ 5 is one of those games where you look at the clock, and 6 hours have passed. a game where you will stay on for one more turn 10/10 would buy again",116.3
"really cool game :) very complex game and i like it :)",17.6
"this is by far one of my favorite strategy games, even though it is turn based and i usually prefer rts over tbs. warning! this game requires a lot of patientce.",109.7
"good for hours of fun with yourself or friends dawg",64.1
"you can play as a communist dictatoral ghandi who kills all and rules with an iron fist.",26.7
"do you not like change? are you a diehard fan of the previous civilization games and dont want to change to this new, dynamic sequel? well suck it up and play it.",98.3
"get this game if you plan on also getting the gods & kings expansion to go along with it. the revamped combat and naval warfare systems, along with the introduction of religion, really round out the base game.",627.3
"its mother flippin civilizationn v! whats not to love?",348.8
"hell yes bad  strategy game. spent tons of hours on this game and im still just a noob, recommended for you and your friends.",42.3
"if you think youve wasted enough time, and you havent played civ, then there is clearly alot of time left to be wasted. alot of time.......alot. of. time. all of the time.",59.9
"always a great game especially when i just get tired of playing fps games and such.",105.7
"many new optiuons and different game play from the other civs. in some way it tends to be civ lite, but once you get all the options in play it has its own depth and plays much faster than the earlier games. the mega death stacks of unit are gone. taking cities over without warfare are few and far between. a nice fun addictive game.",831.3
"very unique game, crafted to balance out fun and strategy but it in a more light-hearted way. remodel the world from the ground up and see how it turns out for you.",10.4
"fantastic war simulation game, if you do not have it get it, and some friends, and have a great time!",43.0
"they believe you are a warmongering menace to the world!",86.5

"if you like stratergy games then get this awesome game!!!",128.2
"welp what can i say this was actually my first game on steam and would you look at that 200 hours later and suddenly im writing my first review on that very same game ! seriously though this game is addicting as it gets its almost impossible to stop in between a session (unless you are playing a marathon game) !great game, great replayabilty, lots of fun ! i also heavily advise in buying the dlc adds lots of content !",244.5
"i prefer the total war series but this is pretty good.",31.4
"this game is great. the expansions even better. best in the series by far. i could play 400 turns and still not be bored at all!",257.9
"this is one of the funest games that i have played in 2013 and am exited for the new game that is about to go onto this amazing game series",391.6
"passes vasts amounts of time in what feels like minutes",116.9
"sickest game ever! such a step up from civ 4 and the dlc makes it so much better!",265.5
"we nuked china 50 times and they were still kicking. 10/10",101.3
"very fun, my only complaint that for an old game it is still very buggy.",72.0
"an amazing game that gets better with each expansion",210.1
"on the one hand, this game is incredible. on the other, its near-impossible to stop. so.. maybe... dont buy it? it will eat your life.",195.5
"the amount of hours of fun i get out of this are awesome, best with parties though",117.4
"i have put 100 hrs into this game and still find new and interesting things. the workshop really adds awesome stuff and makes it even more intricate. i highly recommend giving it a try.",111.1
"you dont even need to know history well or be great tactician to have pleasure from playing that one.",39.1
"totally worth my life to play this game! you would not regret selling your soul to satan to play this!",106.5
"cool game, but dont buy if you want any sort good diplomacy system...",160.4
"an extremely complex strategy game that sucks you in with its mesmerizing depth and unregulated pacing. it may seem overwhelming at first but you will find yourself glued to this game for hours while surrendering former real-world provisions such as food and sleep. the only major shortcoming this game has is the ai, which is often irrational at best and stupid at worst. the game clearly favors war over diplomacy, but regardless there is more than enough strategy to last you for hundreds of hours.",332.6
"the civilization series is amazing, so many hours well spent dominating the world. would be nice if there was a better online prescence but singleplayer is great. if you love turn based grand strategy this is the game for you!",137.8
"ill be the thousandth person to say how addictive this game is, but its digital heroin. anyways, its awesome, and well worth the money.",233.4
"only 4h on the clock, but im already loving it. if youre new to this type of games, you can learn everything from the gameplay, you dont have to browse for tutorials, like many games unfortunately require to even start doing something. the user interface is clean and simple, yet powerful. and gandhi is here :3",42.2
"sid meiers civilizaton v, or civ 5 as it is sometimes referred to, is a very expansive game. the rich culture of the world can be felt as soon as you start playing, whether against the computer or another player. while the game is very detailed, players can choose to play more fast paced games, or take it all the way to marathon and make the game last an extremely long time. its not hard to get so invested in a match that you look at the clock and oh no where did those five hours go. civ 5 is a great game. if youve got the cash, and want an amazing turn-based-strategy experience, this game is for you.",27.1
"wow. such strategy. much addicting. very size. wow.",113.3
"this is one of the most amazing turned based strategy games ive evr played, althought the multiplayer disappointed me a little bit its still definitly worth the buy!",256.4
"a lot of thinking and hard descisions. each expansion makes the game harder yet more fun! tons of strategy and allways different playthrough then that last time!",182.4
"it is a great statergy game, i would recommed to anyone who like to just sit down and play a game as i have played for 6 hours in a row before, in his also good on multiplayer as you can compete with your friends to win the title of great startergy master and overall ruler, i really enjoyed and i hope anyone else who get it does enjoy it to.",102.5
"dis game made me feel like i have downs syndrome. too complimacated",2.0
"this game is a ton of fun, but requires strategy to win in the end.",349.4
"what can i say about civilization v? hmmm... its mother flippin amazing!!! i may have not played that much but you dont need to! you get soo addicted so quick! just buy it already!!! 9/10",104.9
"best game ever .. hold on just one more turn! (five days later) hold on im almost most done!",79.1
"dear college students... dont! ... or prepeare to see your time vanish",352.6
"i played civ 2 as a kid going into this but obviously its been a while. i hate the learning curve on these games since its only really any fun when you have a decent understanding of how it all works. luckily the in game tutorials that pop up when things happen are really good and give enough info to get by at first. the tooltips when you hover over almost anything gives more detailed info that deepens understanding once you get the basics worked out. the deeper you go into the depth of the game, the more enjoyable it becomes. sorta like virtual drugs i guess cept you only gotta pay $30 for this and it wont get you locked up in jail. good purchase imo",203.5
"spectacular game. a blast to play with friends online.",75.8
"another civilization, another masterpiece. still the best game in terms of turn-based strategy.",55.4
"civilization 5 is the ultimate strategy game. 10/10!",1029.0

"as a hardcore strategy gamer who is no stranger to planning out my empires production dozens of turns in advance, ive already turned to civ v for my world-conquering needs  but at the same time, if anything is going to rear a new generation of strategy gamers like the very first civilization did for me, its this. finally, civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",142.5
"this game is well worth a play for any sort of stratergy gamer at any level. weather you prefer war or peace this game is for you! the easy to play style with diferent ways to win means every game is different. with diferent faction units bulidings and effects you can enjoy playing diferent leaders (my faverouts are russia and japan). anyway i hope you buy this game and enjoy this. if you have this game feel free to add me for a multiplayer game.",82.3
"my friends and i play this for hours on end. say goodbye to your social life. forever.",140.6
"whilst this is simpler than civ 4 (especially with all the beyonf the sword expansion) it is more enjoyable to play and retains the depth",350.6
"if this game was a penguin, it would be a pretty good penguin.",225.5
"kind of like the monopoly of the pc games. except you dont kill your friends or family for buying a property.",165.7
"i have played civilization since it was first released, the latest version has got to be the ultimate in strategy gaming. it is easy to get lost in this game, where you control most every aspect of creating your own unique civilization from the ground up! definately a casual game, yet with complexities that can and will rob you of endless hours!",149.6
"a fun game that is recommended to people that like building crap",5.3
"this game is great if you like strategy games, aswell as turn-based games and real-life scenarios. if you are a history geek like i am, you will absolutely love this game!",31.0
"a very good game if you have a lot of free time and want to play with friends",12.3
"have you ever thought why your parents, friends and even people who pass you in the street hate you. its because you dont own this game. it can be as satisfying as using sandpaper to pleasure yourself and after 50 hours it seems to lack depth. but yeah good clean christian fun.",84.8
"it is a good game. until it crashes!! this is inevitable. you literally cannot finish the game. do not waste a penny on this.",143.6
"you can play hours of this game in one go without wanting to leave! it is an amazing mouse only game you you can sit in your chair and not have to worry about any typing! get it naow!!!",29.3
"this game is perfect if you have hours to kill because it is easy to get lost in it. a very rewarding game. and the mods for it are amazing!",542.7
"if you have played civilization before... previous versions... then this version is disappointing. you can tell they just rushed to put it together. the tech tree is was too scewed. the only option is really to gear for war. i played the game about 5 times and then stopped. one annoying feature is hitting the f keys for details. hit f1 for details, f3 for units etc. hitting these keys does not automatically close the other screens like in previous versions. i know this is petty but it just shows the little things during the build did not matter. if you have ever played civilization before, do not purchase this game. i cannot believe it got game of the year. it must have been a bad year..",72.5
"probably my favorite game of all time. so addicting! just one more turn please!",146.1
"great game that is ridiculously addictive. great replay value.",285.4
"this game is amazing, i can spend hours playing and not even realize",24.4
"an immersive, slow paced, and very strategic turn based game that is as deep as it is challenging. if you consider yourself a smart gamer or love strategic and turn based games, then you are doing yourself a disservice by not buying this game.",28.9
"still th reference in turn-based strategy games, and as addictive as ever!",366.3
"one of the best games this decade. a work of genious.",415.2
"what other game could i say i defeated julius caesar with giant death robots ? excellent game that allows thoughtful and even sometimes maniacal crushing of another civilisation. a possible downside would i felt mid-way through a campaign i was merely next turn ing until my society had advanced to a powerful state.",167.6
"its civilization v. if you love civ games, youll end up loving this one too.",28.0
"one of the best strategy games ive played, its also a great game to pay with friends.",368.4
"the new entry in the civ series hits it out of the park, it is great fun that i replay over and over. the new changes to the game make it much easier for new players to get into the game, and the depth is still there for returning veterans.",148.7
"its a great game if you like the genre. brave new world is very well balanced imo.",844.2
"where do i even start? this game is fantastic! it seems really complex when you first start out - but all of the layers that it takes to craft a working civilization start to come together and you dont even realize that 5 hours have passed. and if you get stuck, you have a team of advisors waiting to help you and explain whatever is confusing. plus - there are multiple ways to win. global domination may be the most fun, but i like how they added different ways to achieve victory through peace. overall, this game is addicting and i would recommend it to anyone. must have game. seriously - get it.",137.7
"phenominal game. theres no point in which i get tired playing civ 5. its so much strategy and history slammed together to make one amazing game. my favorite thing about this game is it breaks down the elements of society. are you freedom based? do you want extra happiness from wars? are you an autocrat? in a word, excellent.",382.8
"this game is like if your high school world history teacher gave you an ounce of meth for every class you attended. youre getting a good high and learning stuff about history, but in a practical long terms sense youre merely a slighty intelligable junkie.",209.0
"how to ruin all the things done right in civ4 the game",19.4
"it might take some time and patience to get used to, but its really a great game if you have time for it.",816.0
"amazingly addicting game, probably the most hours i spent in a steam game was this.",69.5
"you lose your life to this game. wouldnt recommend to anyone who wants to stay alive",39.9
"a truly great game. you can spend hours just playing a single game and still not get bored. the abundance of workshop items also helps see other peoples ideas and mechanics in the game itself.",73.7
"some people want to see the world burn id just rather nuke it",47.7
"dont buy this game, its too addictive. its like trading your soul with the devil, i want my life back.",239.5
"this was the first civilization game i ever played, also one of my first pc games as well. being a first timer to the game, and the 4x genre itself, i was pleasantly surprised by the expansive tutorial and how easy the game is to get into. easy to learn, difficult to master, as they say. the base game is quite good, but i would really recommend the complete edition, brave new world being my favorite of the dlcs, refining the cultural victory type into an addictive way to dominate your enemies, not to mention the new world congress where words and legislation are just as sharp and damning as swords and military might. this was my first pc game to break 100 hours, shocking me at how soon and easily this feat was achieved. it is an endlessly playable game with layer upon layer of content. i heartily recommend this to anyone, even if new to the genre.",158.0
"an amazing game. i could just play this game all night, turn after turn. it is also very educational. i new 4 of the questions on my last history test because of this games civilizations and wonders. the strategy is flawless.",73.7
"this game is practically endless and addictive. i have played over 200 hours of this game just to show you how addictive this game really is. it is a great game for any gamer looking for a turned base strategy game.",293.5
"awesome game, addicting. also fun to play with mods once and a while.",809.6
"very addicting and fun. complex but not enough for it to be hard to learn how to play. 10/10",170.5
"ok this is the best stradegy game( besides stronghold kingdoms ), tile-based, very strategic, different abilities for different characters, wonders that give major abilities, and victories including: military, science, and culture....even know this is not a victory, religion is my favorite!!!!",147.5
"it will take you a lot of time but its worthy... nice and great game.",32.0
"this game is great, its a good way to just relax and watch your civilization progress with each decision you make, i rate this 4/5 for the fact that the game can be a bit slow paced at first, other wise, it is a damn near flawless game",43.5
"very fun and addicting, truly the game of one more turn... crap its 3am and i get up in 2 hours havent played civ 1-4 so cant compare to 5.",175.5
"i bought the vanilla version of this game about a week ago, and it has sucked every other aspect of my life up. im constantly thinking what new civ to play as, or who im going to wage war against next. the stategy is wholly absosrbing, and i would recommend this game to anyone. not just 4x or strategy players, but anyone at all. i havent even mentioned the expansions yet. apologise in advance to your family, you wont be seeing them for a while. 10/10",292.0
"a fantastic game that i can play over and over again.",86.0
"just look at the hours ive spent on this...... and im about to play again right now.",569.8
"this is, by far the best strategy game i own. on a whole, the range of victories, techniques, and the actual exploration/expansion abilities you are blessed with make it a brilliant turn based game. even on my failed victories, i still had tremendous fun, because i have to say, it is just enjoyable to build your own civilization. but, of course, it is even more enjoyable when your civiliazation has the power to crush all others! definately recommend, for hours of fun.",152.3
"this game is too much fun i highly recommend this!",407.1
"this is one of the best startegy games ive ever played. if youre going to get one game, get this one.",426.0
"easily the most imerssive sim/rts out there. never will you experience on any other game, the unique circumstances with friends that you will run into while playing civ v. just throw your money at the screen already because i cant do this game justice. you just have to play yourself.",65.4
"ive sunk over a 100 hours into this game. it is incredible. with the dlc added introducing religion and a world politics system that actually impacts decisions. i have a reason to spend another 100 hours playing this game. ive slowly been playing as different leaders and have found the french to be the strongest. building chateaus generating gold and culture really gave me an edge. in a game that can last days and results in 24 hours of gameplay to finish a game, those edges and differences make this game stand out. ill still be playing when beyond earth comes out, mainly because of how long these matches take. :)",151.3
"hey there, friend. do you like being a ginormous  to your friends? yeah? well how about taking over countless civilizations and blowing up cities with atomic bombs, do you fancy that? well thanks for letting me know what type of person you are. if you had friends before you played this game, you can expect to lose them, probably permanently. this game has an amazing learning curve, where all you have to learn is how to play songhai, and how to pillage a village. thats literally it. anyways, if you love a great non-existent soundtrack, 2001 graphics, 1930s storylines, and lots of action, you should probably try minecraft. ol sid meisomethings civilization v is an amazingly below average game that will keep you and your dog entertained for half an hour. 1.1/203",34.4
"ive played every civ, and all i can say about civ v is that it is absolutely fantastic. 10/10 must buy for anyone who has played any civ title ever. you can lose hours at a time and not even notice until you check the clock. amazing game, and cant wait for the next.",109.6
"awesome game!!! love this game and the way it makes you actually create strategies to beat the game. i love the game play and all the characters that you can play as.",28.3

"civ v is a great game filled with everything you can think of to rule a nation.",294.5
"absolutely great game, spent many hours playing it, and its previous game civ iv! a must buy in my own opinion, great fun with friends. the expansions make it even more enjoyable!",42.8
"seems like best game ever. recommended it to all my mates some time ago, nd they were completely amazed by this awesome gameplay, which can make your brains not just simply working on pressing buttons, but to think about strategy and tactics. furthermore, its easy to novices to start their jorney. just try to play and you will be impressed.",224.4
"cant get enough of this game. any strategy fan out there really needs to give this game a chance. it goes on sale all the time, so pick it up!!",77.9
"sid meiers civ. 5 is a really good strategy/military-simulator/government-simulator. though its really good when you play multiplayer. make sure if you want a really fun time to play with friends because sometimes strangers dont take liking to  breaks,  breaks, or food breaks because games here last for about 1-7 days",147.9
"this ing piece of  is addictive and i hate strategy games",19.5
"so if you like turn based games and are sick of the real world buy this game and build one to your liking, super effective at reducing free time.",357.4

"i think that this installment into the series is about as good as you can get in a stategy game. it is turn based and is definitely an addicting game. the dlc that theyve added makes it all the better. i cant wait until civilization vi comes out!",56.8

"very fun game, it is very easy to set up a game for multiplayer and singleplayer. i would recomend this for everyone.",258.9
"this is definetly the best strategy game on steam. the sale i got it on let me buy the gold edition for $13. it was well-worth it. my friends kept pressuring me to buy, although, i was unimpressed at first while looking at the gameplay. i thought i would play it for 10 minutes and become bored. but man, was i wrong. the game has great replayability, and the critical thinking of whether you want to declare war, want peace, or trade among other empires. set up your cities with the right amount of troops, workers, and so on of what you please. the games are long and i have yet to take over the planet, but with the suspense of every turn makes you want to keep playing. this game lives up to any expectation of a strategy game.",74.8

"fun game. in the future, us mac owners would appreciate getting the same game as the pc users get. for example, there is a comment on the store page that mac users do not get the soundtrack even though you bought the gold edition but the pc users get it. it would also be nice to be able to use workshop items. none of the ones i want work on a mac.",287.9

"a very well-made turn based strategy game that those with an interest in history will appreciate. your goal is to create a civilization that will stand the test of time which can span from the rise of man to the modern and future ages. with many options to choose from, you can go about the task in any way, influenced by your choice of historical figures, each representing a different civilization. the gameplay is incredibly long. while the game may go quickly early on, once you become familiar with the mechanics and all the various things you have to keep track of, it can take hours to finish a single game, possibly days. of course, you can always save and resume later. single player scenarios change up the game, providing you with special goals, restrictions, and sometimes different figures to use, along with customizable options for free play games to keep the game interesting.",238.0
"countless of hours spent on this game, one more turn untill you fall over your pc. worth the money. and its a game you will always come back to to play a round of. i remember when i just got it, belive i did a all nighter. :)",341.7

"if you are into micro managed, turn based strategy games - this is the mutha fn biggest one out there. the gold edition is the way to go opening up a huge amount of races and adding in religion for even more layers to an already polished game. some of my games can take months to win depending on size and settings... or you can speed technology up and dial in a specialized area/war.... many ways to win. time, science/tech, war, diplomacy, social.... a+++ game.",226.3

"i was going into this with high expectations and came back with little to no complaints at all. the game creates a lot of improvements being already dominant in the grand strategy genre and is absolutely nerve-breaking. i highly recommend this game to strategists in particular. pros: - challenging - smooth management features - tactical warfare - create your own empire..",19.1

"an amazing strategy game for newcomers and civ veterans alike! theres so much customization available in this game. if thats not enough for you, theres some great stuff in the workshop that the communitys made. really great, addicting game!",37.4
"civilization 5 is a very addictive game. between the expansion packs, the steam workshop mods and the addictive gameplay, you could be spending your entire life playing it. i recommend this game. i also recommend the two expansions packs gods and kings and brave new world. they both add a lot of new content to the game.",160.4

"intensely fun if you like turn based race games of which this franchise began (as far as i remember from my youth). a little buggy, but not so bad that it detracts from the game once you get in. in game animations go away durring multiplayer mode, which annoyed my brother but didnt bug me.",95.8

"ive never played a civilization game before this one, but i was already aquianted with the greatness of sid meiers pirates! so, when i saw this, i decided to go ahead and give it a try. im not big on strategy games, being a bit slow on the take myself, but i have to say that since i got this game just a few short days ago, ive spent a good 35 hours watching my civilization swell across continents. its extremely addictive, and i can honestly say you lose track of time playing this game. its very helpful to new players, and it didnt take me long to pick it up. i certainly reccommend this title to everyone.",81.8

"r8 goot gam. it can be plenty fun, even for people who arent vets of the series (me) and who arent turn based strategy buffs (me). it feeds you gameplay elements and things to think about as you go on, so every new game doesnt bog you down with a million things to manage. the game is visually appealing as well and the soundtrack is often quite nice to listen to i rekomend",190.1
"a classic game of time vampirism. highly recomended.",124.8
"civ v is a very worthy entry to the legendary series of 4x games. finally it has hex-spaces instead of squares for better unit movement. also the kinda ridiculous unit stacking is gine, now you can have one military unit and one civilian unit per hex. (though this leads to its own new problems) but i highly reccomend civv to be played with the two large expansion (gods and kings, brave new world). they make the game just plainly better and only with them civ v might be on par or even above civ2.",228.2
"the game is awesome, ive never played such a realistic strategy game",312.0
"epic - amazing game. just making a civilization and claim world domination either by war, science, religion very fun either way. the lower dificulty of the game is very easy and most enemies are passive and wont attack you. great for beginers, but if youre searching for a challange the higher dificulties puts you to the test. ive seen people fail in the higher dificulties",42.3
"the perfect balance between complicated and playable, the dlc is a must though.",203.0

"incredible. i find it hard to stop playing once ive begun, playing for hours trying to destroy my enemies. the espionage, the diplomacy, etc. are all things that add into the amazing difficulty of the game. even on easy settings there are so many things that keep you on your toes. great game.",256.2
"the game makes you the beginning not easy, but when you once figured out how this  works you really get sucked in. its a must-buy title for everyone, not only for round-based strategy games-fans, but for everyone, cause this is the king of all strategy games. oh and take ones time, this will take some hours... trust me, it needs hundreds of thousands of hours to play the most of the game. clear buy recommendation. ps: buy the complete edition. come on its just 10$ or something more and its really worth it. now go and get it!!!!!",96.4
"i totally recommend this game for its dynamic gameplay and challenging a.i. what i like most is once you beat the game there are various mods you can utilize to renew your civv gaming experience. this game is totally worth the investment.",272.0

"youre damn right i recommend this game. it may seem silly with some of its cartoonish interactivity, but, once you get past that, it is one of the most addictive simplistic games ive ever enjoyed within the strategy genre. i play it for hours without even noticing such time has gone by, yet i dont feel my time wasted. i enjoy this game and i believe you will to.",191.0
"a true classic for all strategy lovers. ive never seen a game so complex and amazing looking. the movements are smooth but later in game the game start to slowly get an fps drop due to the vast amount of units. i guess that is natural, as most games would fail to get that right as well. the ai is smart, difficulty is at the right level to what you choose... maybe a little too good.",275.0
"i think this is one of the best strategy games of all time!",73.3
"ignore everyone until i reached nukes. then i nuked everyone. i won, but the victory was hollow. there was nobody else to enjoy the irradiated earth with me. next time i shall keep a pet civilization to entertain me. 10/10. highly recommend.",52.9
"this game is amazing. it is a great strategy game and really gets you thinking. it is super addicting and never gets boring and the replayability is 10/10 because there are different scenarios for every move you make and every different character you play with. it is pricy but if you have the money i highly reccommend to anyone to get the game even if you arent into strategy games.",16.8
"civilization 5 is an amazing game and is one of the best installments in the sid meier series.",34.1
"this game is definately built for people who went from risk to axis and allies because risk was too basic, then thought this isnt complicated enough either... that being said, i love it, 5 stars.",308.3

"its a great game. you lose track of time real fast while playing though......",80.9
"overall, i would recommend civ 5 to anyone who enjoys strategy games, aside from the hardcore turn-based strategy lovers. the game is quite easy to pick-up, and it is play style is pretty intuitive. while accessible to the new tbs player, the hardcore tbs players may find this game a bit superficial, as it certainly has room for more depth and complexity to enhance the immersive feel of the game. the game has great community support with tons of mods being added constantly for this game, which can help to add to some of the lack of immersiveness with the vanilla version or even with the 2 firaxis expansions. given the 235 hours that i have put into this game, i would definitely recommend this game.",303.1
"if youre going to play this game, be sure to keep a clock nearby so you dont accidentally end up playing until 4 in the morning. oh and the expansions are a must",465.4
"great game, has issues with some video cards, but its a lot of fun. some of the mods dont seem to show up even when subscribed through steam. if youve played any of the other civilizations, its worth your time.",442.1

"to be honest i dont think ive ever been more absorbed by a game in my entire life. dont think that you need to be amazing at strat games to enjoy this one, this is my first civ game and the games tutorial system is extremely helpful without being annoying. it does a wonderful job of bringing you along in a way that just keeps you coming back for more. i advise setting some kind of alarm when you play this one though, this game is the closest the human race has come to building a time machine. buy this game, stop reading reviews and buy it.",127.6

"this game is by far one of the most addictive games ive played recently. ive literally spent nights playing on a large world map with my buddies. sat down one friday night and started to play this, i looked up thinking i should sleep soon and realized the sun was rising ! excellent game, great dlcs, just make sure to not trust gandhi. hes supposed to be peace loving but hes got a reputation at starting nuclear wars and spying on your cities.",134.5

"fantastic game providing me with at least a good 20 hours of interesting and unique gameplay. the game is graphically beautiful, well polished with next to no bugs, well designed and above all fun to play. in singleplayer the ai will give you a run for your money and you can vary things as much as youd like with the plethora of customizations and different map generation engines and settings avaliable. multiplayer is also somewhat enjoyable although loading and wait times can be a little offputting. after a good few playthroughs however the game can become somewhat dry and repitive as the small difference in civilizations dont necessarily vary each playthrough enough for it to be a new experience in its own right. however on the first through plays the game provides you with an unparalleled experience which the civ known for.",91.8

"endless replayability with fun gameplay makes it a great time sink for the casual and hardcore gamer. get some friends together and team up against higher level ai or just wail on each other for added entertainment. be wary of ghandi though, cant trust that guy.",283.6
"this game just gets better and better. the spies can steal technologies, each ruler has specific unique qualities that reflect their place in history as well as offering opportunities to gain advantages over friends and the ai. the variance in map creation is also a blessing...it allows me to work on my weaknesses (naval battles) or cultivate creativity in new ways. the tech trees also help forge paths to specific victory conditions as well. just really fantastic gaming experience.",154.3

"aside from the fact that this game turns 6 hours into 30 minutes, its pretty awesome!",66.4
"takes a bit of getting used to at the start but once you get the hang of it you will be playing it for hours and hours on end. as well as a single player element there is also multiplayer so that you can compete against other peoples civilizations to rule the world!",239.7

"best turn base game out there if you have all the dlc you will get bored after 500 h +. it is amazing !!!",342.8
"civ v delivers on every positive word that has been spoken of it. as a fan of turn based strategy and games i can quickly pop onto in the downtime of a busy schedule this game is absolutely pefect.",36.4
"so many hours gone, because you just need 1 more turn. first time i played all of the sudden it was 4 in the morning. the variety makes it a new challenge everytime.",267.8
"this incredible 4x strategy game is the gold standard for the genre. fantastic graphics, great design and balance and a ton of replayability. if you are a fan of strategy games, pick this one up!",290.8
"time to write history (be careful though, as people will stare at you confused whenever you talk about the nuclear war between you and gandhi)",152.5
"havent played it much, i need brac  dlc to play with nick and collins... what the  i buy the game 5 dollars 6 years ago dont know hwo to play why did i eeven install it? 14/14 - its alright",15.3
"this isnt game dosnt have the highest played hours in my library for nothing... well maybe its that the game takes days and sometimes weeks to complete... but with infinite play through possibilities its a game one could play constantly... :)",602.1
"this game gave me trust issues. f*ck you, egypt and arabia! 10/10 would play again",27.2
"firstly and most importantly: i have never played a civ game before. secondly, the first time i sat down and played civilization v, i played for almost 8 hours. consecutively. the game is that addictive, and i havent had that kind of hook on a game for a while. there are many ways to play and ultimately be the best civilization. the game might look unappealing and boring to some, but the game is really easy to understand, yet extremely deep at the same time. im mostly a strategy/mircomanagement person, so take this game recommendation with a grain of salt.",103.7
"an improved hexagonal movement/combat system as well vastly improved graphics, a new interface, and a diverse technology tree makes this a worthy entry in the civilization series. its not terribly different from previous titles, but the improvements made are welcome, and its just as addictive as ever.",94.4
"strategy at its finest. be the culture that inspires the world, the warmonger that crushes anyone underfoot, be a diplomat and prove that pen is indeed mightier than the sword, be scientific and nuke the world leaving nothing but soot. many ways to win and so many different civilizations and leaders that history fans will grin and swoon for their favorites, and for the rest of us, theres building the pyramids in japan as the mayans while you make war with egypt. yeah, history is great.",57.4
"like turn-based strategy games but had enough of those old and  graphics? get civ v. plays as awesome as civ iii!",33.6
"this is one of those games that its hard to call finished, but i did win a campaign with the ottoman empire and got achievements that say beat the game, so that works for me. i dont have a good frame of reference for this, as i have not played any of the other games in the series or anything similar since an older simcity, but i liked it quite a bit. i was victorious through science, which was cool. i ended the game by being the first to get a space ship to alpha centauri. i was in a space race with catherine the great but managed to get her distracted by agreeing to attack denmark but letting her risk more of her forces.",8.3
"great game!!!!!! they need to come out with more mods to make the game better",73.7
"undoubtedly my favorite game of all time, so i guess its fitting i write a review. civilization v is the perfect game for you if you take pride in accomplishing long term goals, want action and suspense without the need to be constantly at the computer like in a fps or rts, or else want to blow a third world country to the ground with nuclear weapons before coming in with giant death robots to finish the job. or you could make paintings. you decide. thats really the beauty of the game, you can choose your path and every game is different from the last.",464.1
"great game, would definitely recommend it. only downfall is that it is waaaay too addictive.",206.0
"so much fun, to play single and multiplayer, and if youre worried about not having enough time for a complete game, you can change the settings to accelerate turns and make you able to do more in them but less turns, it can easily cut game time to a third",56.1
"great way to waste so many hours of your life where you could be doing so much more.",52.9
"honestly is one of the best strategy games you will ever play enjoyed it alot and is a good way to kill time but it can get boring when you play it for too long.",31.8
"civ 5 is a turn based strategy game. if you need more, i would include board game, as it has many qualities a board game would poses. you start civ 5 by choosing a nation(or a random one). then you will find yourself on a randomly generated continent, where you must order your people to perform tasks, to begin discovering the wheel, expandin your nations borders, trade and war with your neighbors, and finally, either win by building a space ship to travel to alpha centari, becoming leader of the world by the united nations, dominate all other nations with your supreme culture, or simply taking everyone over with your supreme military. if you have hundreds of hours, you alone or up to eleven friends could play together to dicsover if you have what it takes to rule a nation. do you have what it takes, to forge a nation that can stand the test of time?",831.7
"omg this game is amazing. i really havent played many of the other civilization games so i guess i can say this is my first. if youre the type of guy that likes to run an empire through different eras, then this is the game for you. i must say i had my doubts when i bought this game, but it is so addicting when you get into it. (if youre into these kind of games that is)",123.9
"i love this game....ive always been a huge fan of civ games, and this one is just as good!",41.3
"frustrating and exhilirating. it is, for better or worse, the epitome of just one more click.",577.3
"at first i was not a fan of civ 5 after coming from civ 4 but getting the gods and kings and brave new world really improved the game for me. i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.",470.2
"if you dont have this game, i feel bad for you son, i got 99 problems but ghandi aint one... however the zulus are at least 9 of them...",55.8
"10/10, utterly brilliant turn-based strategy, excellent purchase",279.1
"im conflicted with this game. its much easier to play multiplayer now with steam, but civ4 will always be my nostalgic favorite. cool new things (to c5): more in-package civs i like the hexagon grid as opposed to the squares city-states! a bit more stream-lined better graphics added in archeology, music, arts, and writting for culture policy trees pantheons and customizable religions things i miss (from c4): trading technologies trading maps (otherwise, whats the point?) the animated building of wonders upon completion using mods in multiplayer leonard nemoy baba yetu (song) founding multiple religions multiple units per-tile",227.9
"i should go to bed. hang on, one more turn...  its 3am. 10/10 would play again.",223.3
"i came to the civ game late. only started with iv, but have had so much fun. game lengths can vary based on settings and is great for one you want to knock out in an afternoon or if you want an epically long game that takes a couple weeks to get through. i can see how civ really has defined the tbs 4x genre and civ v is a really great release with the tweaks an addition they brought (hexagonal tiles, no army stacking, more political aspects to you strategy) and has really made a well rounded game that you can play anyway you want.",72.7
"i cant belive that i played it for 1000 hours! every game has needed various situation and tactics.",1028.4
"my favorite game to just relax with. even at higher difficulties i never really stress out with civ i just sit back and try to execute my strategies to the best of my ability and hope i dont spawn in a desert. dlc is well worth it since it adds so many new layers to an already complex game. multiplayer is a blast as well. always a good time to beat a friend to a wonder and listen to them rage over skype.",146.0
"ive always loved the civ games and this one is even better.",121.1
"manage your empire as you decide how you want to expand its influence throughout the world. be the first to send your helpless people to the infinite beyound, big mac the world into submission, or choose to do things the old-fashioned way, through brute force.",48.1
"great game and thank you so much valve for giving us this game on linux. it would be even better if there was a sdk tool for this game on linux.",71.7
"this game sucked and it is highly unlikely you will play it for more than a day. i tried to and in the end, i felt that i pissed my time away.",24.9
"is addicting and fuun... i would tickle sids  for a copy of this game. 11/10",24.8
"civilization v....one of the only civ games ive really played quite a bit of, and for a reason! it plays well and is rather easy to get into for newcomers to the series! the dlcs add waaaaaay more complexity and way more units and stuff to do so if you are going to buy it, buy the complete version for the full experience",152.3
"this game is, and will be, one of my favorite games if all time. its so much fun, and can have a nice mix of hard, and easy stuff, with a large variety of community created content in addition to the dlcs.",161.6
"its very good. i recommend playing with at least the gods and kings expansion. for more balanced multiplayer, the third one is good.",395.8
"very good game love it to bits, dlcs a bit pricy though",424.0
"best game of all time? easy, civilization. started playing it in 2007 and im still loving it today. this game ruined my life!!",5.5
"i blame this game for the destruction of my social life",270.9
"one of the best games ever. lost countless hours of my life to this game. one more turn",351.3
"if you like stratgey games this is the game for you but keep in mind the games are very time consuming and can take days to complete",57.4
"a great new part of the civilization series, the new tile system makes the game even more challanging. and, as with the previous games, the dlc create a brand new experience for the base game.",136.1
"best strategy game ive played, much better than europa universalis iv. its currently on sale, get the complete edition!",96.5
"the best 4x game series out their and this version def doesnt dissapoint. sure their are some changes that mayb i dont completly agree with but the game is a solid 4/5 imo.",16.6
"nothing quite like using gandi to take over the world really!",63.1
"one thing is for sure, if youre going to get this game, get the complete version. the base game is meh, and the complete version has all the dlc for a reasonable price. anything else positive and negative has already been said by other reviews. so yes, get this game if you have the patience for it and 37 dollaz to blow off.",122.4
"achievements. supple, beautiful, volumptous, bouncing achievements.",414.8
"amazingly additictive strategy game that is extremely fun alone or with friends.",68.8
"this game is probably what made my life complete. creating a civilization, being the best civilization(or the worst), an endless amount of mods from the steam workshop. this game cant get any better 10/10",511.5
"very entertaining to play. its easy to get started but can still be challangeing for expirenced players in the harder difficulties. i would recommend to buy the complete edition if you want a greater varity of victory conditions and also a experience thats closer to civ 4 (since the base game doesnt include religion and spying)",199.1
"i like this game but for some reason it crashes a lot. if anyone can help me figure out why that would be splendid.",5.2
"not quite as addictive as some of the older iterations, but once you find all the workshop addons, you can really tailor the game to your own playstyle.",78.2
"spent 8 hours building up my civilization, wiped out in 1 minute with a nuke. 10/10 would reccommend",142.4
"good single player or with friends, also get bnw dlc",111.0
"wery good game but europe universal is much bether",14.2
"you can spend hours playing this game and never feel time pass. its pretty cool",519.9
"there is a lot to this game and unless you care any bit for a strategy game i would not suggest this game to you. it can be fun, there are a lot of different modes and a ton of different choices in this game. it takes awhile to get to understand. there are tutorials to help you understand the game and get better at it but you can still play the game, not have any idea of what your doing, and still get somewhere in it. i would know ;o.",41.5
"its like age of empires meets risk, its just amazing and i cant stop ing playing it.",181.9
"i dont normally play strategy based games, because i dont like the pace or the game play all that much; but i really enjoy this one. the historical accuracy of military units makes me pleased that there was ample research put into the background of the game, and it is also pretty fun that you can win in a variety of ways if you dont want to just focus on having a military. it makes it a more diverse game with lots of replay fun, imo. :)",325.3
"should do a fun mod.. make the barbarians zombies ..",423.9
"it is really really fun. i got it not really knowing what it truly was. i just wanted to make the 2k sale worth it. but when i started playing, i was immediately entranced. i recomend it to not only fans, but everyone.",45.2
"great game. ive been a civ fan for a while, and i wasnt dissapointed with civ 5. the ai i a little screwy, but it doesnt take away from the game.",133.5
"definitely the best civ game thus far; the combat element is far more tactical when you are restricted to a single unit per tile and dont just end up with a stack of trebuchets like in previous releases. as always, there is a good spread of difficulties to play on, and you should be able to find one to suit you that is sufficiently hard to win against without seeming impossible.",200.4
"i swear time ceases to exist as i play this game. whether you are crushing sparta with the legions of rome, or using the advanced technological knowledge of babylon to send a rocket in to space, you will love the epic that is civilization v.",245.1
"this game is addictive in singleplayer and delightful in multiplayer. 10 conquered civilizations out of 10, would buy again.",54.5
"love this game. at first it got boring after a few minutes of gameplay but upon learning the core of the gameplay and strategies, this is one addicting game.",277.5
"having played all the civilization titles from the start, including the spinoffs, i definitely will say i have enjoyed civ v the most. many of the questionable mechanics have been refined, and playing militarily actually takes strategy as opposed to unit spamming.",166.2
"just started playing but i really dig it already. little slow paced at first but it picks up steam fast!",113.0
"this  pretty tight its like an asian girl with big boobs just very suprising and underrated",357.1
"i secound the people who say just one more turn... but be wary, it might not work 100% of the time (but it does work)",206.0
"oh the days ive wasted away on this game... honestly one of the best games to kill time. you literally have no idea where the time disappears to.",132.0
"fun. made even better with mods. dont come to it expecting it to be like civ 4. its the same core concept but there are many changes made.",122.1
"it was a beauty to play, cannot stress how much fun this game is. anyone looking to spend a good few weeks playing hours on end with their mates on this easy to understand game, i would reccomend to get this. will need to however consider getting a good pc, as i have found out that laptops are not ideal, however a normal desktop on a low setting will do just grand.",147.4
"the first civ game ive ever played and it makes me wonder what i missed out on before! its an extremely addicting game that is relatively easy to pick up. at the same time, im always learning something new too. the dlcs add a lot of interesting concepts to the game and i would recommend them if you can get them at a good price. for the amount of time ive put in, this game and additional content is well worth the prices (especially since i got it during the steam summer sale!). just remember to look out the window, stand up and get back to the real world every now and then!",279.4
"just gonna win by taking my entire army to delhi. *whole army destroyed by nuke* just got nuked by ghandi. 12/10",295.3
"excellent turn based strategy game, i have been playing this series since civ 3 and it is one of the most addictive games ever!",298.4
"unlimited fun! not only is the base game great, but all the mods you can get really open the game up. be prepared to lose hours of your life!",87.0
"perfect turn-based strategy game, either if your playing alone or online with friends, it will deliver you hours of fun. 9/10",34.5
"this was my first civ game so i cant compare it to past games, but ive thoroughly enjoyed this game since it first came out. each expansion has added a ton to the game. the first gods & kings expansion gave civ v a lot of depth and introduced a lot of new elements, i wouldnt buy any less than the gold edition for a new buyer. then the brave new world expansion added even more, so if youre able just buy it all.",118.1
"hardcore strategy freeks this is a must buy but i cant recomand this for anyone else youll be irritated by its pacing and how nearly every match becomes a battle for who can aquire the most uranium.",337.7
"this game is great if you like the strategy type of city/civilization builders. *note* gandhi is a smug piece of . he will come to ruin you if you denounce him... even if you trust him hell stab you in the back. theres no winning with that jerk.",2.1
"i havent been able to stop playing, even though its basically a game of who can be the biggest force of colonialism and imperialism. it has taken my soul.",206.6
"i like it, but put steam workshop for this on mac.",451.5
"one of the best strategy games, with amazing add ons and a great moding community",73.8
"so i owned this game for about 6 months before i started playing it. i have fallen in love with this game, whether because i feel like a badass when i crush each little city-state, or because dido is one hot mistress, im not sure. but i would definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes to feel like a badass, and play like a cheat. this game is also a good way to get your brain into a very strategical mindset. after 150 or so hours of playing, im sure i could be a 5 star general. in short: buy this game. stock up on extra food first.",23.2
"civilization series is very addictive. i played this game for 5 hours straight last saturday i believe. it is a turn based strategy, but you really dont feel like that. the line between turn based strategy and real time strategy is hard to tell the difference these days. i recommend this game if it on sale. you wont have huge options available as far as what youll do, but if you are looking for a simple way to replay the same thing over and over agin and totally dominate the world, then i recommend this title. you will be building lots of roads and making huge cities waiting to offend foreign leaders who get in your busniness for no reason.",15.6
"i really enjoy this game it is good fun. one downside is that it is long, but in the same it is good for me anyway because i love games that take a while to complete. i recommend it to anyone that enjoys building, war, or just playing with friends",493.0
"exellent game for those who like strategy, its a very creative game, i recomnd it... get it if you can",50.9
"this is definately the absolute greatest turn-based strategy game ever. i have been a fan since i first played civ iv and i could not wait for civ v, and i have to say that i was not dissapointed at all. the level of realism in the decision making aspects of the game is incredible and the graphics are phenomenol. if you are a fan of any genre of strategy game, i definately reccomend you getting this.",157.7
"why must i download the game that i own the cd for?! steam suxxxxxx!!!!!!!",0.7
"i love this game. it is the type of game that you can take a break from and come back to it weeks later and feel as if it were your first time. there is an infinite amount of ways to adjust the difficulty and no two games ever play the same. you may strive for world dominance and yet find yourself a cultural empire that is winning the hearts and minds of the youth around the world. a must buy if you like strategy games. just check out my hours logged...",535.6
"love this game! i probably go back to this more than any other.",975.1
"ill try playing a diplo match... aaaaaand everyone else is dead. recommend",288.7
"play as gandhi, nuke washington back to the stone-age on the penultimate turn. (that smug er.)",360.5
"super bummed at finding out you (apparently?) cant unlock achievements when playing with mods. this, of course, after ive converted practically the entire world to pastafarianism!",128.6
"this is brilliant, to begin with, i was pretty unsure how the turn base would work, being a rts player for a long time. but, i have to say, the turn base is very smooth and quick when playing against ai or humans. this game has so much depth, it has civilizations and tech i had never heard of before and it has amazing replayability. i have only put in 42hrs so far, so playing online can be a bit intimidating, but the experience is amazing, the feeling you get when you discover gunpower and then an enemy rocks up to your city with tanks and nukes is amazing and makes you want to become a better player. 10/10 would recommend.",185.4
"played 37 hours of this  in the last 3 days. if you buy it, dont expect to re assimilate back to the real world.",81.3
"there are no stacks of units, every unit has its place and therefore meaning on the map. and i like that the most in this game. except this civ5 is very user friendly, and by this i dont mean simplicity of the ui only, but also general friendly design of the game. its beautiful. although the original game is all-sufficient, the 2 major dlcs introduced quite a lot of interesting content which organically fits the game mechanics and add a lot to the gamplay while still keeping the simplicity of how things are handled. the only thing i can complain about is a bit strange way of using mods, though the devs fixed it mostly. recommend.",165.7
"i have been playing civilization games since i was about 8 and have always been impressed. it has only gotten better over the years. if you like turned-based strategy games with multiple ways and fun interactiveness, then this is the game for you.",126.8
"this will not be a review but instead im using this as a way to get the word out to all new civilization players in general. the game changer for me was misterciv5s channel. watching his series of tutorials is the best set of intructional videos for all levels civ v. yt search:  misterciv5 over the many years, ive played all genres of video games but never a turn base game. let alone one of the most complicated or highest learning curve required to play a civilization game. theres a reason why i avoided civ game in the last 10+ years. but in the age of youtube tutorials, ive tried to give civ another go.",74.0
"among all games ive ever played, this is the one with the greatest long-term motivation and replayability. last bought the gods and kings dlc. it invented the religion points and many more features. it brought some new aspects, units and buildings which are useful and interesting and let you play the game again and again. so ... this game is my all-time favorite!",118.2
"civ 4 is a lot better..... they noobed it good for the casual gamers.....",9.5
"i need only one reason to not recommend this game. i wasted 3 days playing (at least 15 hours) because i accidentally pressed the retire button on the menu when i opened it to save my game. the game said i abandoned my civilization but that they were not worried as i would some day return, and also it gave me 2 options, go to menu (or something on those lines) and no. one more turn, one more turn. i used the last option thinking it will not actually retire me, so i kept playing, saved the game, and after many our when i finally get the diplomacy victory (world leader) nothing happens. surfing the web i learned that confirmation technology is not available in this game due to its compliated nature, i mean are you sure you want to throw all this time you spent to the trash? of course! you dont need to confirm that. seriously, what the  firaxis?!",120.3
"great strategy game has now become even better. it has come a long way since i played the first civilization on a ibm 386 :)",698.6
"france asked me to go to war with the celts then denounced me for war mongering. 10/10 would recommend",84.3
"if you dont have a lot of free time on your hands, well you will heve to make some. this game will swallow you hole.",24.6
"endless fun. this game has so much replay value, i guarantee you wont get bored.",456.7
"i love this game. the graphics are great and the animation is awesome so you should totally get this game.",185.6
"wonderful turn-based game, a must if youre looking to add to your game library :d",169.4
"fantastic game. used to be a bit rubbish, but was massively improved by the expansions they released. now its incredibly engaging throughout the whole timeline of the game, even at the very late game. being in a position of power doesnt make the game any less interesting, because of the numerous victory methods, so the other civs always keep you on your feet.",72.6
"kill. ghandi. before. he. can. build. nukes. and thats all you need to know!",27.9
"good game. it takes a very long time to get all the way up the tech tree.",48.6
"i swear to the gods; get this game and you will fail all of your college classes. so oviously you should get it",491.3
"surprisingly addictive... guaranteed to make you hate your friends when they attack your cities and force their religion upon you.",73.2
"easily the best strategy game ive ever played, especially after the gods and kings expansion! start at the beginning of civilization with one small city, expand your borders, build great wodners, build an empire, improve technlogies, engage in diplomacy, conquer the world!",653.9
"best game i have ever played on pc 9/10 if ran on a good pc that can support huge worlds full of ai this game cannot be beaten in the strategy category. hands down the most enjoyable relaxed game. it is also hard to find good online play with strategy games yet, although due to other players some times tedious still adequate and fun to play. easy peeps",590.6
"i really love this game. its great to play by yourself but is even better with friends. my reconmendation is to turn on miltary domination and go china with your friend as japan and dominate the whole world.",68.5
"its civ. i dont love it quite so much as i loved civ iv, but for my marriages sake, thats probably a good thing.",86.1
"really like conquering the world with this game. muahahahaha.",87.1
"this game is amazing and is a great strategy game :d, cant wait for civilization vi :d",65.4
"must more than addictive. i find myselfe always saying just one more turn, this is most times 5 hours later. great game. i definately recommend this. also get the complete edition.",16.6
"this game is fantastic. its something you have to play to fully understand, but it has satisfying depth without being a turn-off. it lets you create your own history, and its so satisfying to hit caesar right in his smirking face with a nuke. nuff said.",101.5
"fun with friends and takes strategy to a new level, buy brave new world with it, and you will be satisfied.",92.4
"i like this game - i hadnt played any of its predecessors, but mac users should be warned that steam workshop is pc-only, so youll be on your own if you wish to add any player generated content. also, the game is very long and time consuming. a small-world scenario on quick can take 16-20 hours to play if you start in the ancient era. so i recommend it, but non-windows players should be aware that they get less than the windows players, which sucks especially since its not mentioned anywhere on the store page.",72.0
"once you learn how to play, addicitve. world domination is fun!",19.8
"play as some of the greatest empires the world has ever seen and compete to become the the truely dominant civilization. finally become a ruler of a nation and decide the fate of millions by either causing a nuclear holocaust or by peacefully negotiating with other world leaders. lead armies to victory, or trade until you are rich. the choice is yours. just dont play unless you have an hour to spare.",549.9
"love this game! this is my first tbs and civilization game, and i am impressed: -graphics are beautiful -the interface is friendly -games are both long and challenging -offers hours of content!",167.9
"this game is an amazing strategy game. its not fantasy or anything like that. what i love about this game is how realistic it is. you really have to think what your stratgey will be against other players and npcs. the only bad part is the time you have to spend on this game. if you are willing to spend a lot of time on playing game or games, then you will enjoy this game for sure.",106.1
"you will start playing this game at 4pm next thing youll know its 4am. this game is awesome and while its not fast paced its a great attention holder. just dont play it if you have importain things to do the next morning.",211.0
"one of the best games ever! :d recommended for everyone who wants a strategy game. i mean, everyone!",106.4
"i have always loved civ and have played them all since original and i love this iteration. my favourite change is making each hex only able to be occupied by one military unit. no more single stacks of doom, your units will need flank and rear protection to be successful.",461.8
"this is a spectacular and deep strategy game for those of you with a couple (read: a ton) of hours to spare. its various map generation settings, well-functioning hotseat and online multiplayer modes, plethora of unique and interesting civilzations to play as, and varying routes to victory will keep one entertained for hundreds upon hundreds of turns. one note- the complete edition is a must-buy. gods and kings and brave new world are instrumental to having the best civ experience, as they add awesome features and necessary balance, improving the game greatly.",460.3

"just another 100 turns. then just one more turn... great game so addictive.",93.2
"the pinnacle of the series. if youre already a fan of the series, this is a must play. if youre even the slightest big curious about the series or the rts genere as a whole, this will quell any doubts you may have.",853.8
"just one more turn... and suddenly its 2am and youre fighting on three fronts just because lincoln build the tower of pisa before you, so you attacked and all the city states have turned on you because really early in the game you wiped out melbourne because it was on the coast and you needed a coastal city. the mongols have denounced you, the aztecs killed your spy, your people are unhappy because you cant get a trade deal for sugar... and your last save was back in 1650; its now 1839. this is civilization. the game which can coast along nicely for hours, and then get intense in a heartbeat. the game which you might set out trying for a technological win, but end up winning by wiping out all others. the game which even multiplayer over email is still ridiculously fun. just one more turn...",217.7

"great game, fun and challenging. can be time consuming and it takes a lot of power to make the game run smoothly when the graphics are turned all the way up. either way its a great game for anyone who likes stragedy games.",654.1
"overall: 9/10 civilization v is an amazing game. it builds on its previous titles with improved gameplay, graphics and strategy. it is the kind of game you tell yourself youll only play twenty minutes ff and then go to sleep; when in reality youll stay up all night and call in sick to work. positives: + amazing graphics + exploration is varied and encouraged + interesting cultural bonuses + every game is different + engrossing negatives: - a.i. can be a little stupid at times - you need a heavy duty computer for bigger maps and high graphics - can feel a bit unrealistic at times (the whole world declares war because you took a banana tree)",183.9

"amazing game but the ai cheats on the higher difficulty ratings. i mean the ai shouldnt cheat it just makes the game feel  when suddenly the ai get 50 units out of nowhere in 2 rounds. but other than that it really is quite a good game 8/10",332.0

"cant believe ive waited so long to play this game! ive owned it for ages, i decided to give it a go after watching the trailer from e3 for civilization: beyond earth and got really into it! the graphics are good, the gameplay is fun. considering i love playing strategy games ive no idea why i havent played this sooner :p! granted the match did last 9 hours, i dont know if thats just me being new or the fact theres so much to do and plan out in the game that a good match takes that long to complete, thankfully it was in single player mode so no one was waiting on me to make a move haha! if you like strategy games & enjoy getting into all the mechanics of a well thought out conquest then this game is for you! i would highly recommend it!",14.2

"i cant stop playing this game with my friend xd singerplayer and multiplayer is awesome",90.4
"one more turn. thats what you will keep saying even when you know you have to stop. be it total world domination or establishing diplomatic alliances, civilization is the foundation of empire dynasty building throughout the ages. the feeling of going from a group of settlers with only sticks and stones to reaching for the stars in their rockets is still not lost in this 5th outing. with new crisp and easy to distinguish detailed graphics this game is nothing but superb.",15.1
"fun, quite easy to learn strategy game. the game is fun in singleplayer, but becomes so much better in multiplayer where you can destroy all of you friends wonderful cities :d, also the dlc are must have because they bring so much more to the base game!",120.8
"a very excellent game, the gameplay is quite fast especially with a 180 second turn timer and quick combat enabled. it provides many many hours of gameplay and fun. i also recommend watching a quick youtube introductory video before your first game to get the basics or to play with a friend with current knowledge on civilization 5 or previous knowledge on previous civilization game(s). 10/10.",73.7

"if you like strategy games in general, or just want a game that has replay value to the max, civilization v is the game for you. it is one of those games where its easy to learn, but hard to master. i have played civilization v more than 350 hours, and i can say that you get alot of game for the money. i give this game a 9.5 out of 10.",412.6
"this game is amazing and very intricate. its is a startegy game that isnt mostly focused on military exports, yet the military aspect of the game cannot be ignored. the game has brilliant ai which is the most refreshing thing about this game, and even playing single player feels like you are actually playing against real life people. the only suggestions for improvement i have are to improve certain civilizations overall ability. rome for example is always strong and a major faction from start of the game to the end. but civilizations like brazil or the maya always seem to be killed off in every game no matter who the are next to. other than that i give this game a resounding thumbs up.",182.0
"amazing 1st playing 1 of these games and its easy enough to start off :)",64.3
"sid meiers civilization v is a game you buy once, and you play forever. it never goes out of style, it never becomes repetitive, it never stops amazing me. from the strategic mastermind that wants to conquer the whole world, to the peaceful leader who aims to become world leader through delegation, and to even the man of vision, that wants his civilization to reach the stars -and beyond- it is a game that fits your playstyle, and sets only one question -one that is narrated to you with every start of a match: will you be able to make a civilization that will last the test of time?",121.8
"originally a bit disappointed. new update seems to improve quite a bit of content. stripped back and easily accessible. i miss religion - but definite improvements with new non-stacking hex tiles, minor civilizations (city states) and also great people, cultural expansion and other features tweak better than previous civilizations.",394.4

"i half to say this game is much better and feels more complete and thought out than its previous versions. almost like the serious version of the civilization series and the additional content makes the game significantly more enjoyable and adds more diversity. i recommend this game to people whom enjoy strategy games or sophisticated game players...yes, quite.",107.5

"made canada in custom civilization creator, destroyed usa. 11/10 would force washington into surrender.",17.9
"immersive does not begin to describe this strategy game. its easily one of the most addicting games out on the market, thanks to its decpetively quick turn-based gameplay. each turn is quick on their own, which sets up the just one more turn mentality. which is why any gameplay session - lasting from either five minutes to five hours - will feel like it has gone by quickly. if you want to have your sense of time distorted while roleplaying as an emporer, then this game is meant for you.",355.0
"love this game. game play is excellent, but i do miss the cheats from previous version. i dont like that i have to run steam on mac to play it, the software slows down my computer, runs with out my consent, has to be manually configured to not launch whenever boot the machine for example.",81.8
"i have been playing civ since civ2:tot. tot still remains my favorite as far as interesting game modes and simple mechanics. civ 5 is no louse though. i love to complicated ways i have to work and the mods are absolutely a blast to use and give me back the civ 4 and 3 experience.",770.0

"at first i was like:yeah this building is nice. but right now i am just starting to discover the game and its ways. strategic thinking is a must, just as patience is. but the game is worth it. the expansions gods and kings & brave new world do make the game a little bit more difficult, but theyre also worth it if youre really into it.",220.7
"i must say, if there is any game that i own that i can say is also a time machine, this is it. ill sit down at 12pm so i can get a quick match in. i look at my phone what feels like a short time later and ive missed dinner. i wholeheartedly reccomend this game if youre on the fence about buying it.",258.1

"having not played civ since my old uni days (many a decade ago) i found the latest iteration simple to pick up and get my hands dirty with, the ui is pleasing and aside from some minor gripes well thought out. gameplay is still addictive and the one more turn ethos still permeates through and it is very hard to put down i havent yet played mp as yet as i am just getting my old head round all the mechanics before i dip my toe into that",104.4

"ive always been a great fan of the civilization series and have played all of them, except 2, as they came. though no aspects of it are anything id consider too radical from the original ideas, the steady improvments built on the previous versions have made it better and better. if you enjoy these style strategy games, civ v wont let you down.",756.2

"this game feels less like a grand strategy or even a turn based strategy game and is more like a complicated version of settlers of catan. the hex shape is an interesting take on the original squares but at the same time its restricting with the one unit per hex limitation. it lacks a lot of features its predecessors had, while also adding some new ones. as of gods and kings its gotten a bit better but still feels lacking. its a fun experience with friends and the civilizations all are somewhat distinct. overall i think i could easily give this game a 7/10. its still leagues worse than alpha centauri but its alright on its own. if you can get the game with all dlc for under 15 usd, id say go for it.",133.1

"i wanted to have a good amount of hours in this game before i recommed it or not, guses 200 hours have to do ;). i would like to start to say that the game is great. you can have fun for hours on end even if you just chose one civ to play as. the replayabilty is high with different maps and others civ to play againest.the games do take a long time but once you start you will lose track of time, one miutue it would be 3 pm and 135 turns later its 6 or 7pm. overall a great game, cant wait for beyond earth to get here.",271.2
"with gods and king and brave new world this is probably the best turn based strategy games out there. the vanilla version isnt that good but with all the expansions you can get easily a couple of hundred hours worth of fun. with a great multiplayed and a unique and relatively large roster of countrys you will enjoy this. and its not too complex and overwhelming unlike some paradox games",95.5
"has a fan of civ games i have to say this is the best one yet",302.0
"it took three years, but civ v has finally gone from the unplayable, bug-ridden horrifically balanced turdfest that it was when first released to something almost as good as civ iv bts in some aspects, and better than the previous game in many others.",238.3
"i get lost in this game when i play it and then i look at the clock and 8 hours have passed.",13.7
"great strategy game. you can get hundreds of hours out of it, whether it be single player or multiplayer (with friends or not). highly recommended. get it now.",401.7
"its the perfect game to play with one hand, while eating with the other. sound is not needed at all so watch tv on a second monitor. ive purposely stopped mysef from playing on many occasions because i dont want to still be at my pc 5 hours later. buy it",140.9
"enjoyable, with a variety of ways to play and win.",267.6
"this is a really fun game. it puts famous figures in a battle for power. fun to play with friends, i highly recomend it.",8.0
"you ever want to rule a tile based world? give it a try in civ v. or better yet, civ 3. thats the game we all really wanna play. civ 3 with better graphics, this is that. but with a bunch of rulesets and additions you dont really want. you know what? just play civ iii....",13.8
"one of the best strategy games to this date (even compared to rts genre). dating from the first original civ i this is the game that i always played and consume much of my times. some of the critics to the game is the insane cpu requirements for this game because previous installment of civ always light on cpu and graphic resources, and the exclusion of features like religion and extended diplomat system in the vanilla version (availabe but requires g & k or brave new worlds dlc while previous civ game it is included in base game).",250.0
"a good game~and it spent many time to play i can play one game up to 12 hour",56.4
"if you are going to get this game than you should try and get the expansion packs asap so you get the whole expirence. the base game is very bare, but with the expansions it becomes a much richer and fleshed out expirence. i recomend getting the gold edition when it goes on sale so you can get the proper expirence with civ v.",67.3
"this game is addictive. it uses the same tried and true formula of the other games and will keep you glued to the screen for hours as you just need one more turn... the game is more balanced than ever if you get the 2 additional dlcs. the first makes religion worthwhile and the 2nd adds more lategame options and a revamp of the cultural victory conditions.",119.2
"love this game <3 - tottally worth it especially when it was on sale with all the dlcs :d 10/10",75.7

"very good, top end turn based stratagy! 85/100 graphics 70/100 sound 90/100 gameplay 60/100 replay 30/100 customization dont expect customization to be high in a game like this, although for this game it doesnt really matter, good game great to play with friends can get repatitious/ boreing after a while.",19.3
"one of the best games ive ever played. unlimited hours of gameplay.",77.0
"very slow starting game, but thats what makes it great. chosing what your civ researchers first can help or hurt in the long run. its a new game everygame and games do take a long time to complete depending on the settings you chose. very fun does have mods for it. 8/10",57.3
"if your new to civ, 9.5/10, if your not it starts out being 7.5/10 then as you adapt 9.5/10. hard to adapt from civ 3 being the expansion mechanics are very different, but overall very good.",99.0
"a lot of fun, not too steep of a learning curve and the multiplayer is great. can be a bit laggy at times, but not usually anything that is not worth dealing with.",422.7
"this game is amazing. very addicting, and so much to do in it. the scenarios are just the icing on the cake! a full game on standard time can last hours so be prepared! i love how you can win through multiple means, wether you want to conquer through military might and war or be peaceful and conquer through technology or like four other ways, and its great because its multiplayer so i can play with my friends, and theres plenty of characters to choose from each with their own abilities.",19.1
"this game is one of the best strategy games out there. it is easy to learn but hard to master. ive put about 150 hours into and ive not regretted any of it. there are plenty of difficulties to play on depending on your skill level. however vanilla civilizations ai can be very aggressive and the funnest victiories are domination and science. the diplomacy and culture victories are boring to get. for the best experience, get at least brave new world too. it comes with all of god & kings features, but lacks some civilizations to play as. if you have enough, id definitalley recommend picking up the gold edition and brave new world.",316.3
"amazing game, plus it is great for parents who have to take care of a little one. the game is turn base so you can walk away for awhile and not hav to worry about getting destroyed.",178.0
"an extremely fun game to play even when you only have the base game. but with brave new world and gods and kings makes the experience even more fun. this is definately a game you will come back to again and again.",174.4
"this game is equivalent to a time machine, sit down to play one round, and boom! twenty-seven and a half years have gone by! on the bright side, =10 gold per city next to a river!",23.5
"i was one of /those/ guys who preordered this ages ago with a deluxe edition. now that steams had a sale, other people /finally/ have it, and i can say i played for fourteen hours and a half continuously with a friend. if your time is valuable, just dont ask people to play with you, and youll be okay. otherwise, this can be really fun, if bloody long about it.",118.7
"this game is probably the best i have played. i strongly recommend getting the dlcs for this since it adds so much more depth.",710.9
"this is probably the best game ever, i reccomend this game. 10/10 potatos",90.8
"control youre empire, rule the world, and destroy youre enemies! ive had amazing fun on this game trying to be the best civilization, its hours and hours of fun that i would reccomnded to anyone that loves stratergy games",81.7
"plays this game 5 minutes later why is it 4 am? but seriously, this is a good epic game, but if your computer sucks, i advise you not to get it cause the graphics are too good.",18.4

"i was egypt and didnt build the pyramid, had the greatest science base in the world  you newton kappa 12/10",10.0
"honestly? this game is better than civ 4. it just is. there is no more stack of doom, hexagons make more sense on a tactical scale, and winning the game through diplomatic/peaceful means is now more of a possibility and more interactive. of all the games in my library, this one has me coming back time and time again.",520.2
"i been playing thi game since it came out. and now its original and have many other feature like mod,and expension packs! this game is really recomanded for those who like rpg games,like c&c.",40.6
"its good, but it feels like it lost something compared to the previous civ titles. when it came out, i was crazy-hopeful that it would have the same epic impact that civ iii and iv had, improving on an already stellar setup, and polishing the rough areas. but while the attempt was to mix up the gameplay and see how that would go, it left behind too much of the older titles style, emphasizing interaction over exploration. its good, but ill play civ iv until the new civ comes out.",12.6
"perfect world domination simulator that doesent care much for historical accuracy. if youve ever found yourself enjoying a turn-based strategy game, this will be your new hobby",264.1
"i cannot recommend this game enough, it is the bane of my social life..... 10/10 would lose friends again",166.7
"this game is scarily addicting. if you dont feel like sitting on your computer for 15+ hours straight, dont buy it. 10/10",138.5

"started game as germany, russia became evil. teamed up with greak, japanese, and americans to take down russia and china soon after we won the war it was a 4 man free for all. 10/10 would demolish two great superpowers again and win a 4 man free for all.",45.7
"spent 37 hours building up my empire just to die by ghandi. 10/10",72.9

"great game. it is accomidating to both beginners and veterans alike. looking for hours, and hours, and more hours of replay value, this is a great option. and who doesnt love a good sid meier game?",136.0
"very solid game, only dissapointed in the fact that it left core things like religion and espionage for dlc (things that were included in civ 4).",69.2
"the best strategy game ever made. if youve never played a civ game this is the one to get, with its greatly streamlined interface and controls, you can easily spend the whole day away with this game.",25.4
"my friend is really annoying and he plays this. 10/10",27.8
"one of my most played games. bought it during the winter sale and cant seem to stop playing it",193.2

"fantastic game. over forty different civilizations to choose from. tons of options. numerous ways to achieve victory, and various strategies to support those paths. alot of value for the money.",79.7
"do you like turn based strategy games? have you ever wondered what it would be like to play against ghandi (he will nuke your cities). do you love hexagon based movements? do you love expensive dlc? if you answered yes to any of these questions. buy this game when its on sale. which is all the time",107.5
"engrossing resource management with a bit of randomizing historical figures for fun.",98.0

"amazing game! the best, most rich version of civilization ive ever played.",108.1
"its a civilization game; growth, resource management, expansion and exploration, trading, diplomacy, conquest... the list goes on. after over 500+ hours playing (mostly single player) i can say i more than got the money i spent out of this game--and i still havent touched any of the scenarios, community mods or even organized multiplayer beyond just me and a couple friends.",592.9
"this game is probably the most in-depth ive gotten to playing a real civilization. some of the ai is weird, but its sucked me in and takes a long time afterward to process how my civilization grew and fell.",414.2
"have always been a fan of the civilization series and hope to play online with others one day for multiplayer.",74.7
"although it certainly has a few redeeming qualities, good graphics, replayability, social interaction, etc. this game really isnt worth it. in my experience the games are far too slow (to the point of falling asleep between turns if you arent careful), and your turns are not as engaging and exciting as they could be. also, this game has very poor optimization for computers running amd hardware. cant speak for intel systems.",33.6
"this game is not comparable to civ 4, as so many people do so in these reviews. civ 5 is a completely revamped game and it is easy on the eyes. a simple stratagey game that you can pick up in 5 hours and drop in 500. i only wish the steam workshop worked on mac os.",687.7
"amazing graphics crushing titles like crisis 3? hell no. complicating, difficult gameplay? generally, also no. however, these things are to be expected in a game like civilization v. what the game doesnt lack is strategic difficulty, diverse scenarios, addicting gameplay, and an adaptable challenge for anyone playing it. an absolute must buy in the genre, due to the replayability, and genuinely enjoyable experience.",141.3
"this game is like crack, but a video game 25/10 would buy again",166.4
"get this game i know it says i only logged 167 hours but ive really logged about 370 more until my computer crashed and i had to get a new one and ive never got bored even once now im on my 50th civilazation mostly as germany .. just get this game",196.2
"great game, keeps me playing hours on end even single player is fun enough to keep me playing for hours. every new civs they come out with gets better and better.",91.7
"a game i can truly see myself never getting bored of.",690.3
"its too confusing with all the mods targeted towards you having all the same cost as game itself expansions, gods and kings + brave new world, so i recommend not buying this neverending wallet puller in order to get the content we want from civilization.",292.5
"nice game, worth the money. dlcs are very nice, adding alot to the game. endless replay ability. if you enjoy strategy games, youve come to the right one.",110.2

"civilization: the only place where gandhi goes to violent war against others. *clap*",41.3
"civ 5 is a radical change from the previous civs in many ways, but is equally radically a step up in terms of gameplay. the switch from squares to hexes might seem small, but it makes a huge difference on how easy it is to gather resources and move around the map. the introduction of full screen shots where civ leaders move, gesture, react, and talk in their appropriately native language gives an amazing sense of connection with the past. it is, hands down, my favorite civ yet.",109.5
"my friends said i have too many hours but then i say i barely have half a month worth of hours and thats not enough!",553.7
"whats there to say? ive played over 170 hours and im still not bored. on first release, civ v was full of bugs and almost unplayable. there have been several patches since then, filled with fixes and content changes. overall, civ v is an incredible product and the available dlc ensure that no two games are alike.",388.4
"a deep and engageing stategy game with many ways to win, will keep you up long into the night for just one more turn. highly recommended especially now the expansions have really fleshed out all aspects of the game.",663.7
"really enjoyed the offline play... it was a little easy to complete though, if you want to play multipleyer id recommend the complete version with all mods or else it becomes very challenging to match games as the multiplayer service is deeply flawed.",43.0
"obviously the staple of turn based games. i dont know how the strategy genre would be faring right now without this game out there. no faults at all. only ever crashed one time on startup otherwise no bad experiences. i was also surprised at the attention to the co-op aspect which was pleasing and unusual in games even in the same genre. hot seat mode which allows multiplayer on the same computer definitely allowed me to introduce the game to several friends as well.",49.3
"ive played this game many times, and i think it is amazing! its an amazing rts game, and it is seriously worth it!",16.7
"theres a learning curve but plenty of guides available; turn-based games arent for everyone, but this one is pretty interesting.",558.8
"amazing game, especially with friends. 10 out of 10. would play again.",97.9
"love the game and all of the dlcs make it playable many times",208.5
"this game is my life. seriously. a game takes a lifetime, and its awesome.",98.8
"i have been playing civilization since civii. i can say that his new installment is not necessarily the best; i most favor civiii, and i loved most of the updates in civiv. hopefully, like civiv to civiii, the civilization game after v will be a more refined version. brave new world is a must for this game, as it provides much more options as far as strategy and challenge. overall, would definitiely recommend this game, another legend in the sid meier series.",55.9
"i think this days that game is the best strategy game in the market! i so like the way how the turn based combat is geting mixed with the pure strategic elements. when you start to play is so hard to finish, because every game you learn some new things. like a new player i miss a bit better tutorial. hardly recommended!",74.3
"truth be told, i had no idea what this game was until my firend showed it to me one day, and i liked it ever since then. the total freedom you get with this game is, well not as much as say, minecraft, garrys mod, or spore... but it has alot of freedom consitering of its genera of interphace glory. brave new world just adds frosting to the cake, with new game mechanics and an utter overhall of the cultural and rework of the diplomatic victories, which were way too easy in vanilla and g&k (diplomatic is still easy) but it takes planing for the long hall... if you dont need the great wall... then dont build it you have bigger fish to fry! overall, this game is great, cant wait for beyond earth! also called nuke simulator v",854.7
"make sure to destroy the civ that took the hanging garderns 1 turn before you got it.",144.6
"this is a game that takes time but still addictive i cant stop playing this game its simple it includes steam workshop and multiplayer get it now",100.2
"ive already lost several days to this game so far. please send help.",158.6
"fully expanded it is the excellent. much better than 4, and imo as good as fully expanded 3, which is still my favorite, but this is better overall. at its base version, i would play civ3:conquests over it any day, but you have to start somewhere.",115.2
"the linux version crashes all the time, especially when switching to steam chat window :(",298.2
"still addictive as hell. you will find yourself repeating:one more turn so i can get that thing ready. waiting for fall from heaven mod for civ v.",65.7

"i was a civ virgin going into v and have to say it didnt matter one bit - the design of this game makes it a pleasure to play for hours and hours and hours on end. but it has got some dodgy ai especially if you choose to be more aggressive in your world building with enemies seemingly appearing from nowhere or having an unfair advantage. if youre interested in strategy and want an engaging and fun experience then try this!",46.7
"civilization is a series that needs no introduction. civilization v and its dlc is a turn based strategy game that allows you to take control of a civilization from ancient times through out history and into the future. alot of the micromanagment from previous civ games has been done away with and the game has been made very comprehensive and user friendly for someone who has never played a civ game before so dont worry about being over whelmed. will you conquer your way into the history books? or will you be known as a diplomat, or scientific civilization? time will tell in civilization v.",116.0
"ive spent more hours of my life than id care to admit enjoying the hell out of this game. its not just entertaining, its kind of educational and makes me feel like im accomplishing something. watching my little town grow and expand, and then kicking the butt of some poor mongolions...its like crack. the interface is easy, the tutorial was simple and once you get into it you can dig into the finer details of the game, and will likely enjoy every minute of it.",76.9
"super fun game! i thought it was a little slow to start outwith, then i realized i had been playing for 11 hours",224.7
"before playing this game, my swag percentage was around 63%. after experiencing this icly sexy masterpiece of strategy gaming, my swag percentage reached the new height of 92%.",154.6
"great game. dont trust ghandi. oh btw dont trust ghandi did i mention not to trust ghandi?",260.6
"civ 5 is a comedy of sorts, in a way that you wouldnt realize. the game allows you to change history. new york city, naw, it is called taco town now. there is also humour in the world leaders, ghandi was a man of peace, until he dropped the a bomb on you. personally id give the game 7/10 because of its minor flaws (like game length) but other wise, it is a great game.",16.1
"careful.. its easy to lose a whole day to this game. if you like any of the civilization games, you have to have this one.",183.4
"i discovered the internet before computers. ive invented tanks before the proper use of oil, and ive been nuked by the ethiopian army. this was all in one playthrough. i highly reccomend this title.",100.9
"one of the best games ive ever played. the in-depth strategy has you thinking up new ways to play everytime!",21.9

"great game, civilization is always getting better with age :)",229.8
"its another civ game. it feels genuinely imrpoved over its predecessors but i miss having the resource overview on top of the terrain view. theyve separated them both now so its a little disappointing. theyve removed the ability to annex other nations, but city-states make up for that loss.",132.9
"once you start it up, say goodbye to your free time. you feel like quitting it, and youre like, one... more... turn... and that goes on forever. 10/10 would play for 24 hours straight again.",21.1
"this is one of my favourite games it just does everything right in a strategy game",521.7

"great game, still needs community support in the form of multi player mods.",238.1
"civ v is a slow-paced strategy game that has nearly infinite replayability. its even more fun if youre a history buff. ive played it vanilla, with the g&k expansion, and now with bnw, and these two expansions improve it significantly. i wouldnt recommend starting it up without at least g&k, its just a tad too barren without it, and religion is a really fun mechanism. dont be thrown by the initial complexity- civ is a game that will reward your attempts to figure it out.",343.2
"i recommend this game only is you like strategy games. otherwise you may find it a tad too boring (for lack of a better word). i personally love this game simply because of how time consuming it is. one game can takes hours even days to complete solo; great for making time fly by. when i first got the game, i never really played it that much. but when i started to get back into it, i was so addicted to the game. i would play it hours on end. if you did this too, you may even want to invest in its gold upgrade which includes all dlc (except brave new world of course). brave new world would top off your civilization v gaming experience if you are willing to pay for it.",142.2
"this game is not the most enjoyable to play on your own, as the computer can quickly turn on you and end a game you have been playing for hours just to be a up hill struggle and not to enjoyable at all. with friends though this game is a giggle as you have a human reacting against you. i would recomend it though if you find it in a sale.",16.4
"i spent 7 hours on the tutorial alone, constantly realising i hadnt fathomed the sheer depth of this game at all! so many possibilities, so little time... must play!",33.2

"played 375 hours of civ 5 and i dont regret it! 10/10",406.9
"first of all i would like to warn you all that this game is highly addictive. anyway this game is a great strategy game in which you have to lead various civilizations from ancient times all the way to the future and develop your towns/cities. there is various ways to win the game which are all interesting. you can also play local multiplayer and online multiplayer matches. i would rate this game 10/10. (dont trust gandhi.)",24.4

"i love this game so much that i have literally played for three days straight through, only stopping to pee! didnt even bother to eat! i was too busy devouring anyone else who did not succumb to my will. playing as america is fun but boring. playing as russia and nuking america is priceless. omg the mushroom cloud, omg. how about world domination as the brazilians?! or austria destryoying germany while the brits are tied up with the zulus and the aztecs while the whole time mogolia is attacking and expanding everywhere like a disease killing anything in its path and all you can do now is hope that the barbarians dont take advantage of the fact that you were at war with every civilization and city state and take over your capital whilst dealing with a rebellion in the cities because half your cities were destroyed and everything pillaged........great times. 10/10",584.9

"this game is by far one of the best game i have ever played. vanilla is outstanding and is different each time you play, mods make the game more fun by adding new things to the mix, renovating existing ones, and bringing back aspects of other civ games into this one. i never played the older civilization games other than this, but i can say that this game will please every fan of the old civs. while the games are long, taking many hours to get through one civilization, it is immersive and dynamic, and full of surprises from the somewhat quirky ai. i love all 2k games, but this and xcom are tied. if youre looking for a quick fix, civ 5 is not your game. but if you enjoy seeing the hard-earned results of long playthroughs ending in victory, this is definitely for you",254.4
"this is one of thos rare game, that has everythind, and i could not think of anything that i would like to add to it.",31.7
"its asewome im defenly gone buy beyond earth :)))))",79.3
"a way to kill time (or waste time, if you will) and actually be curious to learn history. but, overall, a good way to test strategies.",515.1
"this game is pretty fun to play, if youre in to games like this, you should definetly buy it.",21.1
"as a civ ii fan ,i got to say this is a massively beautiful game that brings out the true charm of the civ series and is yet simple enought to be play by a 13 year old ,if not even younger",61.9
"highly addictive combination of simulation and turn based strategy. if youre a fan of civ, this wont let you down. if youve never played any of the civ series, i definitely think this game wont let you down. its an interesting mix between age of empires and sim city, for lack of a better comparison.",1003.2
"civ 5 is extremely fun, and even a little educational as it mirrors how real-life affiars in the world could go down.",26.0
"its so much better now than it was at launch. great game to just drop some time into.",390.1
"i can spend hours just playing this awesome turn based strategy game. its a great multiplayer game as well but can just just as entertaining playing alone.",26.8
"this game just keeps getting better and better with every new release. i am a huge strategy gamer, and this next to age of mythology, are the best strategy games out there. this one focuses more on the cities, than just building armies and conquering, which to me seems more realistic in regards to doing what you want to do.",11.0
"love this game worth every penny would recommend it to anyone that loves strategy games",17.6
"this is game is my jam. if you buy this game you will enjoy blowing the living crap out of stupid civilizaions that you dont know #swag2014",43.2
"not as satisfying as the earlier versions of civ but the graphics are fun and love the multiplayer functions. ive already played over 200 hours so yeah, i recommend it.",483.2
"you will have so much fun playing this game...until you meet ghandi",248.8
"10/10 if you intend to play single player only. (the dlcs are a must, they add a lot of content) 0/10 for multiplayer, the game is just unplayable, completely broken. we spend more time waiting on people to rejoin, because they are constantly crashing, than actually playing the game. and its not just one game, but every single game. every. single. game. and its virtually everyone that crashes, not just a select few, but every player. so the problem is obviously not individual. if you love multiplayer, dont buy this. it could have been a terrific game but the devs just dont care enough to make it playable. in mp it crashes more than an early access game. if youre into single player its really great, and buy the complete edition with the dlcs because you get a lot more civs and a couple of new systems.",81.9
"far to many hours played on this game - always fun to play though",516.5
"my absolute favorite game that i have ever played. i never get sick of it. everyone should get the experience of getting nuked by gandhi, attilas loud voice, and ruling the world.",295.2
"i played the original civilization. this one is a great improvement. the additional choices for victory allow the player to tailor the victory conditions to his or her playing style. this means if you enjoy management over combat you can play a game that suits your style. the ability to switch leaders also helps. so the game can work for either style",828.0
"keep your citizens happy or they will rebel, burn your friends fields, and then he wont play with you anymore because you think that deutschland muss vor allem glcklich, wenn wir mrz dem tank in die herzen unserer feinde und kmpfen, bis zum letzten mann steht das blut blut fr gott!",44.4
"before this game, i had always dreamed of a strategy game that wasnt all about war. in this, you can have cold wars that last for centuries, or you can be in a state of total war from the very beginning. there is a great amount of flexibility, replayability, and awesomeness.",338.8
"best tur based strategy probably, still i get bored after few missions. i guess im just not that patient for turn based games",32.4
"sid meiers civilization 5 is a great game. the dlc really enhance the gameplay and experience but overal this game is a great buy. some dont like its turn based style but it does not feel like a board game. truthfuly with 50 hours played of this game i can say its addicting worth it and (good and bad) its time consuming. i would say one thing its lacking on is a few buggs but they may also be client side due to my bad computer. but anyways, the game is amazing and there is nothing like the feeling after winning a long civ game or even capturing a size 10 city. either way i cannot wait for the supposed civ 6. with high hopes and expectations for it, good luck. i definitley recommend this game to gamers. it even has an smooth online function to play with friends. what else can i say but go play some civ!",182.8
"this is an amazing strategy game that i personally enjoy to play during dull moments in life. the game may be expensive, but its worth all the money that it costs.",15.0
"overall, this is a really dynamic and great game. i recommend getting the add-ons, as they add depth to the game. the only thing i have against the game is that the maps are so damn small. now i, being a slowroll explorer type, dont like it when i already know what the world looks like in the first couple hundred turns. but overall, a great game.",456.7
"2000ad, and the entire planet is quivering under my steel-clad shoes, and the very last city-state falls under my influence. all is well, until ghandi arrives on battleships and takes over my capital. bugger. strategic gaming on a whole new level, hours upon hours of replayability.",620.7
"ive played over 500 hours of this in co-op multiplayer with sarah. its a great slow-paced game.",1098.5
"very fun. scenarios are cool and definatly worth it",15.0
"really good game that after a couple ai levels, challenges you. a bit long but with the brave new world expansion one of the best games ever.",93.3
"civilization is not a good game. when i play it, i dont think to myself, my god, the story is amazing, or those graphics were insane, or even this gameplay is intense and awesome. no, i dont think about any of that. i merely find little milestones every century of play and sooner than not i find that its 4 in the morning and all my friends have left. its a time hog without knowing it. it will suck out your life. its a fantastic way to get through a long plane/bus/car ride.",754.2
"buggy game at the start but after patches and 2 expansions it is fun to play",171.6
"one of the best strategy games of the last 10 years, the multi-player is a bit quirky, but still a blast with 4-6 players.",783.8
"i got this game as an early xmas present and i say it is the most addicting and fun game i have ever played. setting up all the units and conquering cities is just too much fun. i always had wanted to change history, and this game lets you do that. i got it yesterday and i have already played 7 hours of it. i have conquered the whole west hemisphere of the earth map. right now, i am planning to take over the french, as their army is nonexistent or little. all i can say is, bon voyage!",27.5
"fantastic game! can spend hours and hours playing!!!",269.6
"i love anything civ, but after 3-5 here, they are going to have to come up with some new stuff to keep this series going, they are just messing with ai, ui, leaders at this point and some skill tree stuff. not sure if i will bother with a civ6 unless i see some innovation otherwise im just buying the same product over and over again.",378.5
"ive loved every civilization game since i played civilization iii way back in the day. the scope of these games has always impressed me, and civ 5 does not disappoint in this regard. some die hard civ players were taken aback from the hex-combat mechanic of the game, but personally, i think that the change was a step in the right direction, making me not dread waging war with my neighbors (which in previous civ games always felt like a chore.) the base game is fun, but ive found that the two major expansions really have improved the experience (gods and kings and brave new world). brave new world, especially, is an excellent addition to the cultural victory scenarios. civ 5 is the most played game in my small steam collection, and with the wide array of mods and community support, it will probably stay that way for years to come.",295.2
"so addicting...i cant stop playing....this game cant be healthy for you. so much fun!!!",102.6
"took me 15 nuclear missiles to kill a lvel 13 city with 38 defense. then i had to take it with a mech infantry",207.4
"i honestly left this one alone for a while, as i first got it for free after filling out a game of the year poll. i wanted to play it but i was in a tf2 craze at the time and ignored it for a while. when i did finally get around to it, i found out that its surprisingly addictive and it was all i played or even paid attention to for a while. i dont even play very many strategy games (the closest thing to one ive played full through being pikmin) and this had me hooked almost immediately. the steam workshop support is also pretty amazing. just be aware of one thing. a quick game in this can last up to about 5 hours at its shortest.",253.0
"this game simply rocks. there is no other explanation needed.",698.0
"the game is fantastic. i do wish that it were possible for steam workshop to work for people who have civ 5 on the mac. other than that, one of my all time favorite games.",322.3
"ive put 433 hours into this game at this moment, and plan to put many more. 11/10, would waste a half of a month of my life again.",537.3

"civiliztion 5 is a great stratagy game that i enjoy playing with my friends and even by myself. there are some lag issues that come with the game, but overalll its very pretty to look at. i use strategic mode because its not really fast on my computer and its still very fun. overall very fun! ps if you want to play anytime online just message me as long as you dont take 10 mins a turn.",52.3
"game is really great, i would like a couple more ways to win... maybe currency related but other than that it is a fantastic game.",125.7
"after 100 hours of gameplay, i devised a plan for a world domination and ended up in an insane asylum for 3 weeks. 10/10",223.6
"this game is a very fun stratagy game that never plays out the same twice. with so many different leaders and paths to take, it is truly an unpredictable and exciting game. the two expansion packs in the game add even more, with more civs, wonders, the introduction of religion and new trade systems the game ends up being even more exciting than before. every step you take could mean an entirly defferent result in the game. rated at six out of five, this game is by far my favorite game out of any other i have played.",406.3
"strategy goodness, its civ... obviously its damn good. make sure you get the brave new world expansion it makes a humungous difference",92.0
"one of the best games in the category of strategy. you make all decisions on how to win the game, with or without suggestive help. you can make your own history of the world. and the ai are completely unlike what the should be, but i would still conquer the anyways. ghandi wants to spread the peace, nukes = peace, greece always attacks you, and sucks at defending, while england is terrible at being an empire. my only complaint is that when the ai difficulty increase, pretty much only there bonuses increase, but there intelligence is too artificial to be any more of a dumbass when it comes to military strats.",76.5
"this game series, just goes from strength to strength. brilliant!",93.6

"great game, full of stratigic thinking. everytime you start a new game you are restarting history,",532.5
"its really fun if you like strategy games, war games or freeform games. i highly recommend this game.",110.4
"this game is extremely addicting, for alot of reasons. you can play as civilization leaders and guid your civilizations to war, peace, production, and much more! you can make tons of diffrent types of troops! some cost resorces (sorry if i spelt that wrong) but in the end its worth it. you can make tons of buildings,creat citys farms, fortresses, mines, and much more! if you lose happiness and money, alot of bad things will happen. in the end this game is extremly addicting and has tons of stuff that im sure youl like!",211.8
"there is a very good reason that this game has eaten 90 hours of my life.",208.0
"civ v is one of those games that you start playing at 8pm, and are like, alright, ill play till midnight, then stop. next thing you know, you look at the clock and its almost 4am.",109.3
"really fun once you get into it, if you like strategy games that take a while, and are full of a lot of freedom and choices, buy civ, you wont regret it.",61.3
"amazing game that only gets beter with friends! nuf said.",1065.7
"very fun and addicting game, worth the $15 for just the game and will leave you wanting more :)",273.3
"with all the dlc, this is quite an appealing package with a lot of working mechanics and tons of playability. among the likeable things is the variety of music.",174.6
"fantastic. the civilization series is, in my opinion, the best turn-based strat game other there.",108.9
"great game, manages to balance calming gameplay as you dominate everyone on the table, but on the other hand ramps the competetive pressure when playing with freinds. great multiplayer experience.",66.1
"its not as in depth as victoria ii or europa universalis, but has much more fun elements and a more addictive nature in my view. buy and you wont be disappointed!!!",280.8
"warning: play only if you have a decent time to spend. you dont play 14 hours straight in a bad game. 11/10 would recommend.",37.1
"i played the previously sid meiers civilization 3 as well as this one. i love this game obviously. it is like playing chess but with your civilization at stake. but it is not really realistic because the historicial figures are who they are, not who you are. like for example, some of the famous warlord like genghis khan achieved his empire by letting his mongel enemies join him or die, and the roman empire expanded not because of its army but because of the use of making roads that made it easier for the roman soliders to march on in caesars conquest. the game would be made more challenging if the world leaders were forced to follow their ways rather than change with the todays thoughts on the success of civilization building. if only if we could renact history and see if the gamers could create alternative historical worlds based on the strategies of famous or infamous historical figures.",113.7
"awesome game! first civ game i have ever played and i enjoy it a lot. easy to get into and once you start, you wont be able to stop!",91.9

"dont let the title fool you. this is actually not trusting gandhi simulator 10/10 would get rekt by gandhi again.",29.1

"if you see ghandi, no matter how early in game destroy him at that moment if you dont he will nuke your  into oblivion 5 times over.",134.5
"had it for three days and ive logged 25 hours worth of play, both alone and with my husband. how do you think it is?",80.1
"best buy you could make on steam. will give you hours and hours of fun and entertainment.",678.8
"its a good game, and you get some really funny situations at times, i had one game where i was the biggest kingdom in the world by far, atleast three times bigger that then next civ, then all 5 of the other civs declared war on me almost at once, so my people just went nope, forget this and flew off into space with a science win",112.8
"what can i say that hasnt already been said about civ v? its amazing... it is probably, hands-down, the best of the genre... entire weekends have come and gone over the span of a single game... it really is a fun title, lots to micro-manage if that is your thing, or just build and destroy and let the ai take care of the finer details. the two expansions add some very new and interesting gameplay elements, totally re-shaping how you play the game. gods and kings adds in religion (which you get to mold and craft as you play through the ages), and brave new world revamps the way trade and diplomacy are carried out. both are highly recommended!! overall, great game. clean design, wonderul hd graphics, hardly any bugs or issues (least with the single-player games, i dont really play this one online, so cannot comment), and lots and lots of replayibility. pick it and start your empire today!!",227.5
"my first real time straegy game. this game is addicting. well worth the asking price and i recommend you get all the expansions for thebest experience",61.9
"not hard to recommend, really; it has sid meiers name on it and its a civilization game. oh, and it now uses hexes instead of squares, has a skill tree for social policy and counts roads as part of your upkeep. really, the only downside i experienced was the intense feeling of racial guilt after conquering the iroquois.",273.4
"do eet! seriously civ is super fun if you like strategy games. tons of fun!",818.5
"great game for any strategy fan, several difficulties make it easy to pick up, but can make it frustrating if you jump straight in at too high a level. no real complaints besides rather long loading times, but thats hardly a gme breaking issue.",195.4
"this game is absolutely incredible. if you are on the fence about buying this, just pick it up when its on sale. i initially was sort of put off by the negative reviews stating the game was buggy, too easy, broken, etc. no, its incredible. just pick it up when its on sale. make sure you get the gold edition, as it will include all of the dlc that add to this game greatly. --buy it--",18.0
"this game has made me late for too many things. it always starts with, just one more turn. next thing i know, im getting nuked by ghandi four hours later.",281.2
"another great addition to the civ series, and now that they have finally made politics a little more viable, it finally has a good depth of play aswell. this game is one of the must have for strategy fans. i have found myself playing marathon games over several days... worst part is that i find it time well spent.",357.0
"yes. hell yes. but just a psa, you cannot save in the tutorial.",54.2
"cons: not ready for new mac os maybe stick to pc on this one. i cant recommend becuase it crashes constantly on my brand new top of line imac. the game is awesome if you can play it i have to save my game so often as to not erase hours of moves after a crash this stinks. i think os x mavericks could be casuing this game issues need patching to address the issue which doesnt seem likely from vendor from what im reading this is huge issue just read the reviews on apples app store version same thing.... i have purchased civ iv since v seem like a dud with technical issues. pro: when you can play it it has depth n greatness in redesign. they have taken this to a new level. im a long time player of civ iii on pc i will try and run v on a pc and see if this thing is stable and return to this review to update.",61.6
"this game is really fun would recomend to everyone :)",187.2
"its a really good strategy game, ever since the first one came out, recommended to people who enjoy such genre of games",19.4
"a good update to a good series. with the brave new world expansion, i think this beats out civ iv, which is no small feat. civ v is a very addicting game and easy to lose track of time in. the game can go many different directions. in addition, the modding community is very strong with a lot of really cool mods.",111.9
"great game that requires a lot of planning and strategy. if you enjoy turn based games this is a must.",65.9
"beats the h*ll out of all those {*}ville games on facebook. play a real game for a change.",163.9
"excellent game. highly recommended. ai needs to be tougher. civ4 and previous ai would just beat you bleading in the night. civ5 ai is like the kid that just yells at you.",163.1
"a great strategy game where your action will affect a lot on the game, if you dont mind spending 4 - 8 hours on a advanced stratestic turn based game, then this migth be what you are looking for. 8 / 10",405.6
"absolutely amazing game especially with brave new world as well i recommend this to any turn-based strategy fan or just a strategy fan.",116.7
"still my favourite 4x game of all time. i cant recommend this game enough if you like grand strategy.",11.9
"pretty much one of the most entertaining strategy games out there!",248.6
"this is definitely one of my go to games. its given me hours and hours of fun. there isnt as much depth as paradoxs games but there is something about it that keeps making me want to go back for more. the two expansions are definitely worth picking up, especially on sale, as they improve the game by a lot, and add tons of new features. also, screw you ghandi.",827.9
"great game. if you liked previous civs, youll like this. possible to waste weeks on it.",126.4
"my favorite turnbased strategy game, exept for xcom but thats a completely different kind of game, so it doesnt count.",337.1
"excellent gameplay, a must-have for every strategy fan!",258.2
"i love playing this game. ive played this game so much (different accout because no family sharing thing), almost 300 hours, and im still not bored. the expansions make it even better, and its incredibly fun to play with different leaders and trying out different strategies. definitely recommended!",54.5
"one of the most engaging turn-based strategy games on pc.",84.5
"damn good, but make sure to get the 2 expansions (god and kings, brave new world) otherwise dont bother.",416.0
"amazingly addictive and intense strategy combat situations strongly recommend trying this game.",15.7
"sooo crap. cannot stand this game. i won this game and thank god i did not pay for it. i do not see what all the hype is about, and it got 90 of 100? i do not see how at all.. graphics are crap, gameplay is slow, lots of loading and pressing next turn, controls are simple click, the only good thing about this game... the videos... they look good and make the game look wow, then you get gameplay and it is nothing like that. it is press click, press next turn, click, next turn, click etc... crap utter crap. canot stand this game or games like this!",1.4
"this game causes time loss. you start the game and the next thing you know, its 8 hours later and dark outside and you missed your shift at work. it is amazing though.",240.9
"ive learnt a lot of history playing this. ive also learnt to misspell civilisation.",293.2
"you create growing empire at the dawn of human history that actually progresses through time advancing/evolving technologically over time as you create your own version of human history. who could ask for a better rpg world warfare game?",32.2
"america keeps cockblocking me whenever i build wonders. 10/10",139.5
"it wasnt until the release of brave new world that civ 5 overtook civ 4 to become my favorite turn-based of all time.",320.2
"new installment in civilization series. now with hexes!",790.1
"more casual than its predecessors, but also more fun and easier to get into. dont expect much in the way of online play as the servers are terrible, as a single player strategy game though its easy to lose days playing and not be bored. bretty gud.",32.5
"the best overlooking, creation, strategy game ive ever played. a timeless masterpiece of perfection.",138.8
"i cant explain it. you open the game...and then you look at the clock and youve somehow lost track of the last 6 hours. any game that can engross you that much is a definite recommendation! a definite must-have for any 4x strategy game fan!!",13.7
"i love this game. i only have one problem is that i bought gold edition but do not have the gold edition dlc so thats my only down side. other than that great game, couldnt recommend it enough.",79.6
"extremely well made turnbased strategy game, easy to play and fun. very timeconsuming.",228.4
"this game is great for when you just want to take it slow. trade, conquer, or just be completely peaceful, this is one of my favorites!",129.3
"pretty damn good, and this is coming from a guy that doesnt like strategy games",26.3
"bloody brilliant. the mods make this game even better, theres nothing quite like playing as the soviet union and crushing the us after a 3000 year cold war.",120.7
"favorite game in my library. super easy to pick up and learn and before long youll be playing for hours on end. endless possibilities in map and leader combinations, so each and every game you play will be different. highly recommend this game, even if have never played a turn-based strategy game, this was my first one and i love it.",698.4
"an excellent game on all accounts. if you love strategy, or if you want to remake history, this is the game for you.",339.9
"how much more fun can a strategy game get? none! i say when playing this",41.5
"good game with friends but the company doesnt do much to improve the game once it was put out, laggy and so on also the game is typical in that it offered things in civ 4 then sold it as addons in this game lol",559.8
"one, enormous piece of art! also, incredible time stealer, be prepared for it.",62.9
"the latest in the long and impressive civilization lineage. while the core mechanics remain the same there are quite a few fundamental changes that really alter the flow of gameplay. the lack of unit stacking requires much more careful strategy when it comes to war and the games balance of culture, military might, and science pursuit really does mean any strategy has a viable chance of succeeding. if youre a fan of the civ series at all or even looking for a good starting point, id highly recommend it. beware of the dreaded just one more turn... oh god its 3 am syndrome! if you do buy civ v i would highly recommend picking up the gods and kings expansion. it seriously rebalances the culture tree, adds religion back in, and is generally more of a sorely needed patch than a seperate game but whatcha gonna do?",361.9
"i hate this game. its too easy to spend hours playing it. my sleep schedule is all ed to hell now. thanks, civ. /s",143.0
"ive only played 10 hours and this game is  amazing. careful to not get stuck in the just one more turn loop if youre playing alone... ive legitimately lost sleep because of how kickass this game is. in that 10 hours i still havent finished a normal game. i think im in the medieval era still, so be prepared for some long  games if you set it to normal game length.",158.2
"if you like turn-based strategy games - this one is for you. you might even learn some world history while playing it :)",608.4
"an amazing game and tonnes of fun. i would recommend this game to anyone especially with the brave new world expansion pack.",471.8
"super great strategy game, but it gets a little old for me. if youre a fan of strategy games of its type, it is one of the best.",53.0
"its great if you got nothing to do for the next 9 hours or 3 days",344.7
"ive lost all my friends and its completely worth it.",129.5
"this is by far and away one of the best strategy games you can buy. it rivals the fun factory of even games like starcraft 2 and dawn of war.",44.7
"one of my favourite game series, civv actually acomplishes what most of the series put out in terms of building an empire. there are numerous ways to win, and a few ways to survive. one of my favourite is just winning from the science method, while trying to get all countries to be peaceful is a pain, at least you can always backup your defense with science.",121.4
"civilization v had a lot of issues when it first launched, which resulted in that i dropped out of the game, because it wasnt any fun compared to the predecessor. when i picked up the game after it was on sale and my friend asked me if it was worth it, i immediately saw a lot of improvements. id reccomend this game if youre prepared to get the major dlcs (gods and kings and brave new world). the rest of the dlcs are just for fun :)",77.7
"finallz after the brave new world expansion civ v really shines, i was initiallz disappointed when civ v first came out as it lacked many features that were present in civ iv with its expansions. with gods & kings and brawe new world the game is at last what is should have been then. a rethought and upgraded civ iv with some new features not present in the previous installement. a great game, too bad we needed to wait 3 years for it to be upgraded to be just that.",713.7
"it would probably take less time to build an actual civilization than finish one game here.",77.6
"if you like strategy, empire building, world revolutionizing fun, this is a great game for you. unfortunately the game is little lackluster in the base game, but dont get me wrong it is very fun. however, adding the two major dlcs (possibly some of the best dlcs to a game) make it incredibly fun. religion, politics, and so much more! as you can see, i have nearly 200 logged onto the game so that should hopefully give a bit of insight if youre planning to purchase it. i wholeheartedly recommend the two major dlcs. over all i love this game and the whole franchise.",291.8
"buy at least gods and kings (preferably from gold edition), and you already have amazing time-sinking game. find some buddies for multiplayer => best game for long winter nights.",100.6
"at first, i wasnt interested at playing a kind of strategic games. but after playing this, my whole opinion turned 180 degrees. civilization v is a great turn-based strategy game. sorry, i mean the best out there. civ v is just like a combination of chess but your opponent is more than one and you may win by diplomatic strategies. it makes your brain works hard to think about strategies for confronting other nations, and this is the only game that makes me insomniac. just...one...more...turn!",26.0
"great game! i usually spend 6 hours playing per session. i can never stop playing!",52.9
"awesome game for co-op or multiplayer, in depth and detailed.",109.5

"just wish you could retaliate to the npcs instead of just taking their insults",74.1
"this is a must have game. thanks to the steam workshop this game allows for a great deal of customisation: wanna roleplay the adventure time kingdoms? go ahead: wanna recreate historical conflicts with civilisations that otherwise arent in the game? step right this way: wanna chance the course of history? civilization v has the power to do all these things and more. endless fun, always discovering new ways to play the game, 400 hours in and only just started taking the religion aspect of the game seriously. still finding new ways for this game to impress me.",621.7
"civv (with all its major expansions included) is the ultimate civ experience. they have taken all my favorite features of past games & smoothed them out and just generally made the whole game more accessible to a larger audience.",426.2

"civilization v is a truely wonderful experience for those who love strategy games. the gameplay feels realy smooth as well as the multiplayer, local and online.",66.5
"first civ game and love it. first turned based game too.",126.9
"very fun game, very strategic. the npcs will punish you at the higher levels of difficulty, but it is worth the challenge. excellent game to play with friends, as long as they dont take an hour per turn :p",77.3

"very good game, you loose track of time when playing.",114.2
"nice game, good graphics at least on windows. less fun singleplayer, but hours of enjoyment with friends. 9/10, from me.",88.4
"this game is amazing (more so with the 2 expansion packs) however it is a massive time sink. if you are prepared to spend hours playing a single match and enjoy turn based strategy games then get this game",91.9

"has to be the best so far, esp with dx11 - cant beat some nukes and bombers!!",137.4
"if you like turn-based stategy games you will like civilization 5, as this is one of the best games in that category. base management, unit management, relations, trading, research, culture, you name it and this game has it. with a lot of maps, civilizations, and winconditions you can sink a lot of time into this games without getting bored. the expansions add an additional ton of gameplay and keep you playing even longer.",69.8

"endless fun, if you heard people say how youll end up going just one more turn. know it to be true! you can play it one day, continue on for months, stop and simply pick it up again and go at it as if the need to play hit all over again. its good to be the king...its even more fun smashing them.",308.3
"the newest iteration of the all time classic. civ v, with its two expansions is finally a complete game able to surpass its predecessor. with the change from squares to hexes and restriction of placing one unit in a space at a time the game becomes even more tactical in the field of battle.",205.0
"probably my all-time favourite strategy game, if not a tie with the starcraft series. what gives this the edge is that it is all turn-based as opposed to real time, like a board game. with multiple ways of winning and games that could potentially last months (though i havent bothered trying that), the options are endless. highly recommend this game for strategy buffs.",135.1
"i have spent too much time playing this game. it is too addictive, save yourself dont buy it. the only thing i have agaisnt this game is that the ai seems wholy incompetent and the multiplayer interface isnt easily customizable.",629.2
"have you ever dreamed of ruling your own civilization? do you spend sleepless nights thinking, man, i wonder what it would be like to start a land war in russia? or i wish i understood agriculture so i can plow queen elizabeth. wait no longer my friends! mad the south last the war? want to start a neck beard religion? now you can! buy civ 5! nuke ghandi! be nuked by ghandi! build stonehenge! destroy the french! build the statue of liberty! develop freedom! deliver freedom to the unwashed masses in exchange for their precious, precious oil! impress the french with your boy bands and blue jeans! destroy the french! what more could you want in a game? buy it! add to cart. destroy the french! tell your friends how awesome it is! gather them together in bars and discuss eugenics! actually, thats a terrible idea! dont do that! buy the game! play it with friends! realize your dreams! rule the world!",239.9
"this is a fantastic strategy game. it also manages to eat all your time , with just one more turn. it seems to appeal to a wide vairety of people , my gameplay hours are from 3 sepretate people. me , my dad , and my sister. the gameplay is really fun , and all aspects are sound , except one : the ai. dont let that stop you from playing the game though, as its well worth your money. i know it was worth mine.",176.9
"this game is an intersting strategy game. it has many unique features to it, all of which lead to a great game. however, if you are looking for depth, there isnt much. civilisation 4 had much more depth which was more and more fun to it as you discoverd it. for people who have never played a civ game, this is a great option. for those who are civilisation experts, this isnt for you.",47.5
"just got the brave new world dlc and i didnt think they could make an already awesome game any better but, they sure found a way and i dont know how i ever liked the game without these new features. it added so much depth and more to do that it feels natural and that it just belongs there.",204.1
"civ 5 is one of the best games out there!!! honestly the amount of time i have spent playing this one game is astounding the modding community is great, and firaxis games are one the best and most caring devs ever the expansions add a absurd amount of contect for an already amazing game for $12 for all the dlc why do you not have this game!!!",532.3

"basically the crack cocaine of strategy games. do not be surprised if you spend significantly more time than you planned playing this game-- last night i was planning to go to sleep at midnight and stayed up until 4 am playing this (lucky its the weekend!) if you arent familiar with civilization, its a series that basically takes risk to its absolute extreme-- you enter each game as one of the many civilizations available and proceed to try to win the game through military might, diplomatic superiority, scientific excellence, or becoming the cultural capitol of the world. with all the available expansion packs, these are all well balanced and viable options. definitely recommend.",148.7
"every wanted to rule the world? well, look no further! with civ v, you can rule the world as one of your favorite empires such as the americans, japanese, egyptians, and even that country youve never even heard about! i guarantee hours of building your civilization from the ground up will be wasted. and then another set of hours will be wasted trying to recover your civilization as you haphazardly waged war against stronger civs... and then you will wonder where your life went wrong. get this game if you like to feel a sense of domination and a mighty fall after!",72.5
"great game if you love to take your time doing research or going for all out war and domination. takes you by suprise how good it looks.",14.1
"i got hooked in my first play session, totally amazing. a must buy to everyone!",26.8
"ive been a fan of civilization all the way back to the first or second one. while my favorite one in the series still stands to be civilization colonization. this one stands true to the ways of civilization with adding even more if you get it on steam. the workshop aids it in its everlasting glory of timeless fun for all who play it. while the multiplayer can be glitchy and sometimes unreliable in the beginning of a game, or with people all across the u.s. (eu cannot play matches with the us on multiplayer unless you join through steam)i still recommend it in every situation although you may need to watch out if you dont like spending hours being drawn into one match. graphics: 8 (for a civ game) gameplay: 8 (10 with bnw) performance: 7.5 (took a hit in multiplayer because of connection, thats about it) overall: 8",148.2

"warning. this game is potentially dangerous and illegal. im not sure how sid meier was able to sell this pure cocaine. **** this game is legit, its a strategy game (+1) has many different ways to play and  but is so addicting. playing with friends for 4+ hours straight and only have to come off due to tiredness, not boredom. 10/10 would and should buy again.",200.9
"two pieces of advice kill ghandi and dont  people off",313.3

"one of my favorite games allthough i dont like the mass-dlc crap and the kinda expensive mini-addons.. if you happen to be able to pick up the gold version + brave new world you will have a great experience once you overcame the entrance to the game and understand how it works :).",214.0

"this may not be the most in-depth review ive written, but its easy to rate this game. i would recommend this game to anyone who at any point in their life enjoyed playing any board game. buy this game as soon as you can and play it with a friend next to you as you build and rule your civilization!",44.4

"a very addiciting game for sure. i love it. it is the best interactive strategy game ive played.",18.8
"im not entirely sure why people love this game so much. maybe i just am not part of the target audience. it should be called waiting: the game. thats pretty much all i did in the 11 hours ive spent. i had high expectations given other reviews that ive read. so far, though, i havent been impressed.",11.4

"to anyone who hasnt played the civilization series, i definitely recommend it. building whole civilizations and destroying others, while choosing your path (militaristic, cultural, etc), building wonders, are a few of things that make this game addictive. the mechanic of having fairly short-term goals under a main longer-term goal makes you forget time and this is the game that inspired the termone more turn. :d",151.3
"10 out of the last 48 hours went into this game. bye life",61.9
"this game can be incredibly fun when mixed with skype, multiplayer, and ideas.",113.9
"a good game if you get it on sale. civilization 5 introduced many new mechanics that i found very welcome, hex based tiles, one unit per square, but unfortunately took away multiplayer modding. you cannot play mods in multiplayer, i cannot stress this enough. what made civilization iv so great were the mods and this game just does not have them. a very unacceptable oversight. crappy launch but the game holds up ok now. especially with the two expansions. however, even after the expansions civilization 5 continues to have graphic issues with texture popping and still has a poorly optimized engine that will be a burden even on some higher end systems.",389.5
"freaking awesome and if you like this game then invest in rome: total war (either 1 or 2)",55.0
"this game is one of my favourites in my library. its a game for anyone that loves or likes geography, it teaches you about history and lets you mold history in your way. i recommend you play this game with friends, you can play online and solo, but its a little more fun with someone you know and like to play games with. i recommend this game! 9/10",71.5
"what an awesome game! a great game even for those new to civilazation with a great tutorial and helpful hints that you can set to walk you through the game in the beginning or that you can completely silence once you become a world ruler! the gods and kings expansion is well worth buying! it adds so much to the game, new civs, buildings, and ways to play the game. i dont see myself getting tired of this game anytime soon with so many options, new civilizations to play as, many difficulties to master and so much world domination to be had! if you dont like this game... well you must be crazy!",40.6

"one more turn and then im done...4 hours later...one more turn and then im done",46.5
"my new favorite strategy game! simply explained, you guide a civilization through history, from the invention of agriculture onwards, and compete against other civilizations and states in cultural, scientific, military, and diplomatic matters. the events that occur during this are just awesome and hilarious, and the ways to win or lose a game are numerous and enjoyable. despite the seemingly complicated nature of this, the game is very easy to learn on lower difficulties. if you havent played civilization before, i cannot urge you more to try civilization v!",66.4
"definitly a good game for those that want a long and fulfilling time.",80.0
"this is a very good and relaxing game. i highly recommend buying this game its worth every cent",66.1
"wonderful graphics, great gameplay, and is extremely awesome.",378.6
"great turnbased strategy game, one of the best within its genre. you will sink in a lot of hours into this game, maybe to many. so to speak this game is extremly slow paced. youre litterary playng a board game on the computer. you might end up playing this game a tremendous amount of time without even finishing one single game. but if you can look past that, then by all means grab it during one of steams many sales. i highly reccomend you to buy the gold edition because it fixes so many problems civ v hade within its launch. if you want to improve your game expirence even more then you should grab the brave new world expansion, however after you have played the gods and king or it will be to much to take in. so yeah it is truly an awsome game.",100.3
"stupidly addictive. ive just begun playing and i already cant put it down. looking forward to getting my hands on brave new world.",228.3
"in my opinion, civ v is a great game. personally i have never played any previous civ games, and this one only a bit over 30 hours. but for some reason, even though its great, i lost intrest in playing it a few months ago. i have the brave new world expansion, and without it (or gods and kings) the game isnt nearly as much fun. i beat the game once, with venice, wich is an interesting faction to play as. it was the diplomatic victory introduced in brave new world (i think so). i think civ v is worth your money, but i dont know why i lost interest. hopefully you dont do the same.",146.0
"in the style of a classic board game, there are numerous ways to win with depth and stratagy.",6.5
"cant stress out how complex and fun this game is. the latest dlc, brave new world is a must have when you buy the game. the game is so complete and allows you all kidns of winning conditions. if you want to be peacefull, you can do it. if you want to conquest everything, you can do it. different speed settings allow you to pace the game as you wish, from a quick 4hr game to a game that can take a few days to complete. user created add-ons bring even more content to the game, making this a game that will provide many hours of fun, and will take a whole lot of time to master and conquest. if you like turn based strategy games, this is definitely a game you must have",335.4

"one of my favorite games, i could play it for hours.",291.2
"you cant call yourself an old school gamer without having civ",136.9
"i came to civilization 5 very open minded, playing very few 4x or rts games previously. my only other experience of the civilization series was the civ 2, a much older square based game that i didnt understand but thoroughly enjoyed. this game has recreated the feelings of utter bliss as your time drains away into this world that is yours to shape but instead of being left feeling confused and underwhelemed, i feel in control of every aspect of my empire and if played right the entire game. well worth the money, especially with all the expansions. maybe try without first, since they just add layers of complexity to improve otherwise tedious sections of the game.",533.0
"mediocre vanilla game, pretty good with gods & kings, fantastic with brave new world. not the deepest 4x out there, but probably one of the most charming.",52.5
"always been a huge fan of the game series and always will be with the depth and character it brings to the strategy genre! :)",84.8
"there are several reasons this is a great game: first of all, it looks nice. but what really makes it great is that its easy to learn and play for a beginner, but an experienced player will still be challenged once he knows the ins and outs of the game. the game is turn based, so you can easily walk away, and yet you still click the next turn button, because it is terribly addictive! it is an absolute pleasure to watch your empire grow from one little village to a large, sprawling empire that dominates the world... or maybe you will choose to focus on just a few cities, and become the cultural centre of the world? and thats the best about the game: you decide everything yourself!",537.6
"a new twist on an old classic, civilization v brings a whole new experiance to the civ series, be it leaders, or gameplay in general civ v is worth a try.",51.3
"such a great game. really deep system that makes you really get attached to your civ with so many different ways to play it.",93.7
"amazing game great gameplay and amazing graphics.the ai runs quickly and intelligently.",18.6
"very entertaining turn based strategy game. good multiplayer and community mods just make the whole thing perfect.",361.7
"this strategy game stays the king in this genre for a reason. once you take some time to understand its simple core mechanics, it becomes oh so dangerously addicting. i could blame this game for numerous wasted weekends and some nights with no sleep, but i cant. i had too much fun running my own little civilization experiments at increasing difficulty levels, and having so much fun. one peace of advice: a good pc is recommended, because the wait times between turns can get annoying, especially at the late game.",254.9
"a nice strategy game, easy to get into and a smooth learning curve. next to ck2 and eu4 my personal favourite, it is just a bit too simple for me, bu the dlcs can make up for it. each dlc expands the game more and more, making it a deeper experience by the hour, the two best features for the dlcs were religions and steam workshop compability, the creators had some nice thoughts about things they didnt liked and either just buffed or nerfed things.",242.0
"sid meiers civlization has always been a game to get you hooked up. if you enjoy the style after a few hours of play, youll soon find out you been playing this game for hundred of hours more. the civilization series has also one of the biggest modding community around; so there is always something new to play. my only critic is the lack or should i say, the absence of space scenarios and more future tech. with this in mind, i give civilization 8.5 out of 10.",497.3

"awesome game. and i normally hate turn-based stradegies. civilizations is one of the exceptions",116.2
"i was not expecting to really like this game when i first got it, but i ended up loving it! the turn flow has just enough hand holding to make it simple on casual players, but it appears as though there is also a lot of depth for more hardcore players.",381.4
"another addition to one of the most successful strategy game series out there, sid meiers civilization v retains the one more turn addictive gameplay that its title is famous for. and, with great bonus content, quality dlcs, a great expansion pack with another along the way, civilization v certainly holds all of the elements from hours upon hours of strategic and fun gameplay.",376.1
"one of my most favoriet strategy games of all time",393.0
"amazing game, endless amounts of fun. with civ you can play for 6 hours solid and not even get board. i would recommend this game to anyone, for the people who dont normally play turn-based games spend about 1/2 an hour playing it and you have learn all the basics needed to have a really good time. should buy if you have the cash!",580.6
"holy  balls is that civilization v?! you bet your sweet non dairy  it is! this game is ing hardcore to the max. commit gennocide, brainwash another culture with your propaganda,  space with your giant science ! this game is so ing good you would suck a  to play it, then play it, then suck a  again to say thank you for the game.",42.1
"great way to lose an afternoon. its always just one more turn",486.6

"sid meiers civ 5, what can i tell ya thats not already said about this wonderful strategy gem. civ 5 is the essential strategy game for the gamer that likes an uncomplicated fun experience that you can get running in a short time. beware though, civ 5 is infamous for being a time vampire, sucking up all valuable time that you have when launching the game. i have left civ 5 due to coughsucking at itcough and because i myself prefer gsg games. that does not mean i dont endorse this title as much as ck2 though, but theyre two different games, honestly. civ 5, great ing game, get it if youre a human.",315.1
"a must have. i have sunk hours into this gam, with its addicting gameplay and strategic play style. a must have for strategy fans!",143.4
"a good game once you get gods and kings added onto it. while not as engaging in same places as civ 4 was, the changes and updates have certainly made it at least a playable addition to the civ family rather then a  child like the last simcity turned out to be.",171.8
"the only thing i dont like about this game is the weird effect it has on my clock. >_> (8am) ...... (civ 5) <_< ........ >_> (11:58pm). what the hell you mean its been 16 hrs?",263.3

"civ v is one of the best games on pc i highly recommend this.",19.6
"being new to the civ franchise i did not know what to expect with civ v however i was plesantly surprised. the game is easy to pick up with many helpful hints and notifications so you dont miss anything - its quite clear what is going on at all times even during my first play through and its very replayable. it is true that some angles of play are easier than others (such as going for military victories) however i personally found this very entertaining trying to get social and science victories as a challenge. i highly recommend this game, but heed this warning - you will lose many hours clicking the next turn button. realising youre a number of hours late for bed will be something you get used to playing this game.",71.1
"i wasnt big on strategy games until i came across this. very, very addictive, and i still havent learned everything about the game, so theres still a sense of wonder to it. bonus points for being tablet-friendly; i often find myself playing this on the road.",178.8
"i have been playing civ 5 since release, it didnt quite hit the mark, as all the games that are remakes or a new version of classic videogame era franchise it was a lackluster. this game embraced almost perfectly (not ea perfect) the new era game selling paradigm, tons of dlc, not so cheap expancions, tons of bugs and exploits, at release this wasnt a 60 bucks aaa game (altough they charged like it) it was a beta at much. too many policy*civ exploits, ai simplifying it had two modes stupid and op stupid, and no matter what you do they end up hating you for everyting. after two exp now i get a game i like, the way they should have released it since start. still has his problems but now you can actually enjoy it.",424.3

"before getting this game: its really well made and in dept, only problem you might get into, is actually not having time to play it. the time it takesto play a match is like an hour to 8+hours, depending on setup options. pros: easy to get into, hours of play, save option, hours of replayabillity! cons: the amount of hours it takes to complete a game, dlcs are pricy, but worth the experience, from what ive tried. 10/10 game with expansions, state of art gameplay quality.",906.0

"awesome game. keeps me seated for tens of hours and i havent tried out expansion packs. i definetly recommend this to everyone, who likes to relax, yet focus on strategy. turn based system works really well.",15.8
"been a fan of civilization since civilization ii, so the fact that i like this doesnt come as a surprise. i will say that i do miss some of the things that were taken out of the games as they progressed through the series (building your throne room was always something i enjoyed), but i can definitely understand why they changed things. all in all, if you like to sit down and play a game, and, lose your whole night then this is the game for you.",56.4
"addiction. too much addiction. must click. must click once more. it is 3 am in the morning, one more click, one more turn. yup, that sums it up. this game is addiction.",12.5
"amazing turn-based strategy, possibly the best there is out there, however its not all perefct but with the expansions/dlc the game is complete so if you consider buying this title you should look to find bundles with brave new world or gods and kings. you do not need any other however these are very importent if you seek a really complex and enjoyable game. however if you lack the money or cant find a bundle that featrues both of them or either one. then you should go with civilization 4 , but if you prefer combat that is more chess like then civ 5 is your bet.",181.0
"wonderful experience, and a game i would easily recommend to any civilization fan or individual who enjoys a 4x-style (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) game. i typically play these games using the prince difficulty or normal difficulty, and i would say that the pace of the game feels very comfortable  i dont feel rushed, or too overwhelmed. units appear to be well balanced, and combat is exciting though sometimes frustrating when trying to deal with ai on either side of your own nation. what i find most rewarding about this, and other civilization games is that i easily find myself returning to them, time-and-again, to explore new locations, build new empires, and battle new foes, and im always amazed at the new adventures i discover.",154.0
"despite its faults (yes it has them) its a great game. one unit per tile gets rid of the death-stacks of older civ games, but makes it very annoying to move large quantities of units over large distances, especially since the pathing is poorly done. the introduction of airlifting in bnw is nice, but requires an airport in both cities. otherwise, the game is fun and there are plenty of mods to fool around with.",319.6
"the original civ v is alright, but it is a brilliant game with bnw expansion. the depth is extremely large. the only lacking part is the ai choices seem to be less smart and i dont like the difficulty penalties.",306.4
"sid meiers civilization v is a great game if you want to build and make you own kingdom and make wonders fight others and research many thing and try to win the game.you can play multiplayer play with friends. im not sayinf buy it but im just saying thats its a great game",155.5
"by far one of the best installments of the series. i do however miss a few of the political and diplomatic functions that were present in previous version. hopefully they will be added in expansions.",119.5

"words can hardly describe the wonder of this game. the unique aspect and ties to real world cultures across the ages is just phenomenal. truly a game worth to anyone who likes strategy, real world history and engaging gameplay!",97.2
"do you like civilizations?! do you like warfare?! do you like firing nukes without repercussions?! if you answered yes to any of the above, read on. if not... read on anyway. i might be able to persuade you. civilization v is nothing like the previous incarnations of the series. except for the overall gameplay, most of the features have changed. leaders have been done away with, and all nations have only one leader. religion has been greatly expanded upon with the gods & kings expansion, and theres a new world congress feature to replace the un in brave new world. that being said, while this is a great game by itself, the unpatched version without the dlc and expansionpacks is inferior to civilization iv in terms of content. if youre planning to pick this up, get it with the dlc or at the very least the expansions. it should give you, at the veyr least, a few hours of amusement.",126.7
"the most refined and elegant civilization yet. a must have!",23.4

"great game the game just keeps moving on and you got to try to be ahead",144.6
"one of, if not the, best civ games to come out. the updated combat system make the game more interesting. also the dlc is well worth it. just make sure you dont have anything that needs to be done in the near future once you make the plunge! ...one more turn...",105.0
"at first i was a bit alienated after playing the 4th game for so long, but after a time it grew on me and with the gods and kings expansion it ended up being definitly the best game in the serie so far.",433.0

"i dont know much about the civilization series as a whole but i have played civilization revolution (i know some dont consider it apart of the series) on the xbox 360 and the game stays true to what it is all about, that one more turn addiction, and single matches that can go on for weeks to months. i highly recommend this game to fans of strategy with the new hexes instead of the usual average tiles and the elimination of stacking units. to fans of the series you probably already bought it and to those who arent particularly a fan of strategy still try the demo im sure youll find something good on it that will keep you hooked.",159.7
"this is by far the best game i picked up during the summer sale. i didnt think i would enjoy it very much, but its been a blast. even though the majority of the gameplay is clicking text boxes and moving along a map--its strangely engrossing and extremely compelling. if you enjoy turn based games this game will likely entertain you for hundreds of hours. put history in a blender, hit puree, and see what comes out.",214.4
"civilization 5 is a solid game. it looks and feels a lot like an expanded digital version of the board game called the settlers of catan. yet it must be said that there really isnt much depth to the gameplay. even though you have a lot of freedom to customize your experience to your liking. at the end of the day, civilization 5 really seems shallow and almost childish compared to the vast depth and immersion of different paradox games. games such as europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2.",43.9
"nearing 340 hours and i still cannot get enough of civ v. a special kind of alluring and seductive addiction.",373.2

"okay, first you need to know that ive played everyone of the pc-based civilization games since sid meiers civilization first appeared back in 1991. with that said, ive enjoyed each installment in this genre and each has had its pros and cons. civ v is probably one of the strongest entries by a long shot even while it has a number of players of the series critical of several major changes that were made both in game play and with the units and combat. personally, while i was initially critical, too, of some of these changes, with time i have come to enjoy the current version better than most of the previous versions. the dlc/add-ons as well as the thriving gamer modding community for civ v ensure that it will last a good long while on many players systems.",253.9
"its civ. if you like to conquer and rule countries, maybe even the world, youll enjoy the game. if you like to shoot things, try something else.",128.2
"i played this game. why i still play it: 1. trying to outcompete that annoying oda. 2. i likez nukes 3.lead conquering armies to conquer almaty. 4. scare civilizations with your sheer might that when they want peace, you get all their stuff.",142.6
"while a decrease in dlc prices would be nice, this game exells in all other aspects",139.2
"since the latest expansions this has turned into a great game. no longer looking back at the days of civ4.",934.5
"very entertaining turn based strategy game. good multiplayer and community mods just make the whole thing perfect.",361.7
"this strategy game stays the king in this genre for a reason. once you take some time to understand its simple core mechanics, it becomes oh so dangerously addicting. i could blame this game for numerous wasted weekends and some nights with no sleep, but i cant. i had too much fun running my own little civilization experiments at increasing difficulty levels, and having so much fun. one peace of advice: a good pc is recommended, because the wait times between turns can get annoying, especially at the late game.",254.9
"a nice strategy game, easy to get into and a smooth learning curve. next to ck2 and eu4 my personal favourite, it is just a bit too simple for me, bu the dlcs can make up for it. each dlc expands the game more and more, making it a deeper experience by the hour, the two best features for the dlcs were religions and steam workshop compability, the creators had some nice thoughts about things they didnt liked and either just buffed or nerfed things.",242.0
"sid meiers civlization has always been a game to get you hooked up. if you enjoy the style after a few hours of play, youll soon find out you been playing this game for hundred of hours more. the civilization series has also one of the biggest modding community around; so there is always something new to play. my only critic is the lack or should i say, the absence of space scenarios and more future tech. with this in mind, i give civilization 8.5 out of 10.",497.3

"awesome game. and i normally hate turn-based stradegies. civilizations is one of the exceptions",116.2
"i was not expecting to really like this game when i first got it, but i ended up loving it! the turn flow has just enough hand holding to make it simple on casual players, but it appears as though there is also a lot of depth for more hardcore players.",381.4
"another addition to one of the most successful strategy game series out there, sid meiers civilization v retains the one more turn addictive gameplay that its title is famous for. and, with great bonus content, quality dlcs, a great expansion pack with another along the way, civilization v certainly holds all of the elements from hours upon hours of strategic and fun gameplay.",376.1
"one of my most favoriet strategy games of all time",393.0
"amazing game, endless amounts of fun. with civ you can play for 6 hours solid and not even get board. i would recommend this game to anyone, for the people who dont normally play turn-based games spend about 1/2 an hour playing it and you have learn all the basics needed to have a really good time. should buy if you have the cash!",580.6
"holy  balls is that civilization v?! you bet your sweet non dairy  it is! this game is ing hardcore to the max. commit gennocide, brainwash another culture with your propaganda,  space with your giant science ! this game is so ing good you would suck a  to play it, then play it, then suck a  again to say thank you for the game.",42.1

"i have always had a soft spot in my heart for grand strategy games. this 4x game hits all the right sweet spots. pick a civilization to conquer the world through diplomacy, culture or military might! there are lots of options to gameplay, and many scenarios to try out. i thoroughly enjoyed many of the european ones. there are lots of mods that can bring new blood into the game once you have become bored after many hours of play. i would definetly recomend this game to anyone who enjoys playing complex board games, because that is basically what this is, a giant board game. lots of fun! 5/5",51.2
"very cool strategy game. love it and recommend it to all. you will have tons of fun playing",0.4
"great game but needs more options so that i can make more than opne or two of a unit before its obsolete and cant build... eras move way too fast without option of control... only complaint....... edit: cant play past turn 500 due to late game lagg... its very horrible........... so you spend weeks playing just to get screwed over in your final moves to win the game..... very frustrating!!!!!1",542.4

"epic game, emotional and stratigic! quite relaxing. 8/3",38.9
"sid meirs civilization v is a easy get to know if your a starter at strategy games. the dlcs add mroe complex things which allows the starter to enchance their experience and become a intermedient. civ v is basically a building block from where you can decide which strategy games you choose in the future that offer more challenging experiences. overall civ is a great game and is highly reccommend if your just getting insterested in stategy. if your a right on pro at strategy games get civ still because why not? greece pwns 10/10",665.7

"whats there to say about civilizations 5 except it provides epic proportions of nation building, conquest, and even diplomacy and trade with the new dlc. if you like building empires or armies then you should get civilization 5. if you have played too much of civilization 5 and dont own the dlc then you are missing out. i would wait until all the dlc is bundled togeather along with civilization 5. you know it is only a matter of time until that is done again since there is a new civilization game coming out shortly. also there is a massive mod community, albiet something i have not explored much, which can provide tons of new experiences on top of the normal game.",210.0
"civilization 5. pretty damn good if youre into turn based strategy games. the game unfortunatly requires some dlc to get the full experience. if you finish a game youll probably realize how deep this game goes. there is multiple ways to play and this creates a replayable heaven.",824.7
"quality game but be warned it will take up all of your free time :d",144.9
"really didnt know what i was getting into when my friend turned me on to it, but civilization v is now one of my favorite games! being more used to real-time strategy, i didnt thing i would like a turn-based game that takes a long time to get through. i have never had the same experience twice, though, even with the same civilization, so it never gets old. the only downside is that if i step away from a game for a few weeks because ive been busy, its really hard to pick up where i left off. that being said, i am addicted and would absolutely recommend!",216.5

"in this game, you play a cruel warlord, bent on world domination, using your ability of immortality to lead your nation. you make your people happy by giving them luxuries, to distract them from the cruel and constant warring of nations, who cearly have no care for their people, but only care for regular income, and further destruction and annexation of each others territory. this game paints a harsh depiction of a dystopian nightmare world, were territory and military prowess are all that matter.",186.9

"just bought this game on sale cause i got addicted after playing the demo a few friends warned me about the dangerous path that lies ahead....they warned me about the one they call gandhi the destroyer of worlds, i shrugged it off an started my conquest. i was about 10 turns into my game when the balded headed messiah came to waving a white flag of peace. i stupidly accepted an was soon deceived, because a few turns later he delcared war with me an killed me. turns out that flag was a bunch of lies an deception. 10/10 would be deceived again",8.9
"this is amazing, a huge improvement over civ 4. the graphics are way better, and the hexagon like grid system makes it alot easier to move around. you can see mountains through the fog, the game no longer continually nags you to build unit a when you want unit b, gameplay is fast and fluent and it steam workshop support is a big plus. my only issue is that there is no way to turn off the camera moving when the mouse is at the edge of the screen. i seriously recommend this to anyone who has played any previous civ game, or any fans of the rts genre",1.9

"want a game that will keep you busy for hours, maybe not fun but certainly keep you busy... buy this game. wont say its my fav. of the civ series, but its not bad. my issue is with the expansion packs; you pay a lot of money and it never feels like you get much overall for that money. this is one of those cases while the game id buy if want it, id hang about for a sale on the expansions, especially brave new world as thats often more expensive then the actual game. :-/",101.1

"a great sequel to a great series. thoroughly enjoy playing it. the only controversial change to the battle mechanism - (no more stacked units), this does make for a different battle which is quite fun. i miss being able to update your cave / throne room from the previous versions of the game. the ai seems pretty easy to counter  (hint) never allow open borders, expand quickly securing strategic tiles and land.",228.5
"i love this game. but even better with dlc if it would ever go on sale **cough cough**",204.5
"i have always been a fan of civilization. while i think 4 is my favorite, this on eis definitely a close second. i cant wait for the next game to come out!",49.4
"civilization v is the latest installment in a long running franchise of popular 4x games. its a turn based strategy game that lets you build your empire however you see fit, whether thats becoming the most advanced people on the planet, or the only ones. you control the course of history and theres nothing more satisfying than leaving behind a legacy.",176.0
"for those interested in history and strategy this is the the best turn based game on the market.",73.9

"great game! fantastic visuals, realistic gameplay, and decent ai",42.8
"if you havent played a civ game or only played civilization revolution on the consoles, its pretty complicated but its super fun even when youre -30 gold per turn and everything is terrible. its very satisfying to wipe a whole civilization off the map as they try to negotiate peace when theyre down to their last city. its marvelous.",44.1
"great game worth the money, but you might want to wait for a sale like i did 10/10",56.7
"brilliant game, cant stop playing siince i brought it and just love being able to play it with all my mates :d",155.8
"civilization 5 is probably one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time, i really enjoy the series even civilization revolution for the xbox 360. but overall i recommend this game to all 10.5/10",36.9

"this is one of my all time favorite games. it will keep you up til early next morning...",89.4
"although turn based strategy games are not everyones cup of tea, this critically aclaimed edition to the civilization franchise is a detailed and intracite game that once learned is extremely addicting. although it is pricey, once a steam sale rolls around it can be as much as 75% off. it is a must have for anyone looking for a new game to sink hundreds of hours into.",567.7
"this is a great game has some what oof a learning curve but other then that itys great",556.8
"excellent game. you end up spending a lot of time, but its very relaxing. the expansions make it much better.",40.0

"an absolutely fantastic game for anyone who enjoys strategy games!",67.9
"with all the expansions and dlc, this iteration is finally living up to the name civilization. although very different from earlier games in the series, it retains the depth, character, and addictiveness. my only disapointment is with the lack of completely game-changing mods that made civ iv into such a wide platform. overall, id recommend it with all expansions to any strategy gamer who hasnt already picked it up.",329.7
"started playing it a week ago. i have a total of 26 hours, and my wife is giving me worried looks, so i have to say that this game is awesome. so many strategies and things you have to take into consideration, that i feel like im only scratching the surface.",34.9

"its a fun game for those of you who like strategic gameplay.",37.4
"ive been a civ fan since the very first by sid meier. i remember impressing adults that in 4th grade, i knew a lot for my age about geography (capitols and major cities), as well as major political figures. i like civ v, but wish some things like the city view from the day, or building a palace would come back. i also used to plan out my cities with the whole 3x3 thing, but with civ v the geography rules are way different. i also, in all honesty, dont really like the city state thing... i almost always cut the number of city states in half when i play (usually like having larger civs). overall solid statigic game and will play it for hours still, but some features i wish theyd bring back and some shouldnt have been introduced.",91.3

"best time waster ever. such a good game, ive loved this game since i got it a few years back and im so excited to see the next installment of this series take us to outer space. this game is, in my opinion, te easiest strategy game of this exact genre to get into.its easy mode is truely easy, and dont be afraid to just hang out on the easier side of things for your first 100 or so hours, but once you feel good enough to delve into the harder modes, this game really shines.",371.7

"easily one of if not the best games on steam. check it out!",16.1
"a terrific game. thousands of strategies are available ranging from all-out war to peacefully expanding your culture across the planet. each time i play, i know i can count on a totally new experience. with many different civilizations and strategies, maps and game play options, and finally (and arguably the most enjoyable feature) an easy to use multiplayer, this is truly a complete game. i would recommend this game to everyone who has even the slightest interest in strategy games.",115.4

"this game strikes a cord in strategy gaming, great graphics, animations, combat and mechanincs. the only bad thing i can see with this game is the fact that it only ever feels complete when you have all the expansion packs, the base game feels rather barren.",363.5
"civ 5 should be put up as an honorary strategy game with its own historical plaque or something to signify it. in spite of the recent launch of beyond earth, coming back to civ 5 just to play the vanilla game - without any of the dlc or whatever - is still very good. the mechanics are still veyr familiar, with different bonuses, graphics, and a new map gen; and the main things vanilla seems to lack is solved by adding the brave new world and gods&kings expansions. tl;dr: dun good guys. 8/8.",134.6
"really good. def a good buy for any fan of the series.",65.7

"this is one of the most addicting games that i have played. i have found myself starting to play and then looking at the clock after what felt like minutes and seeing that i had been playing for hours. it is the perfect game for anyone who loves strategy games and it plays out almost like a digital board game. my friends and i can not get enough of this game.",34.9
"sid meiers civilization has always been a game where you could sit down and play for countless hours. it never gets boring, as each time can be different. civ 5 upholds this expectation and adds to it with amazing dlcs. if you dont have it, its worth getting without a doubt.",32.8
"civilization v is sort of like a time machine.. you start playing friday night ---> you look up and its saturday morning.",141.2
"played a game for a bit, checked the time, and it was 5am 10/10",34.6

"in these reviews: clever epic maymays. abandon all hope ye who dont like to jerk each other off endlessly want to recreate the sacking of rome as... pachacuti?? well now you can! thanks to (yet another) fantastic game from sid meier and firaxis, the vanilla game has just about all you could want to do and yet each dlc expansion pack (gods and kings and brave new world) add enough for basically a whole new game. after all expansions have been purchased you get such luminaries as george washington of america, mahatma gandhi of india, theodora of byzantium... you know the wife of emperor justinian i, and gustavus ing adolphus of switzerland say whaa? and if those arent enough, there are a seemingly endless amount of mods in the steam workshop",276.4
"this game is a really a good stratagey game and recommend to all",213.6
"i realy like this game. one of the best strategy games ive ever played. depending on how you like to play or how fasy you want to play the game, there are plenty of customisable settings. when you play online however, dont put it in hybrid mode because it sucks, use simultaneous and turn auto unit select off. when at war it can really screw you over.",347.3
"the best civilization game that i have ever played.",168.0
"very well made turn based game. beware, very long games, not for an occasional casual player. found single player games fun for a while, but got extremly boring after a while. multiplayer on the other hand though, never gets old for me, adds a much more interesting game, after all, your dealing with real players. excellent to play with a friend[s].",286.3
"cant say much other than this game is amazing. can get extremely bolring though, so turn on netflix while you play. infinitely better with g&k and bnw.",128.3

"an extremely good fifth version of this series. more leaders, more units and some fantastic scenarios.",283.6
"im not going to say its a bad game, because its definitely not; theres a lot of thought behind its design and the strategy therein. but i will say its a game i do not enjoy playing, and that mostly comes down to it taking way too long to get anything done; i always get bored and quit before i finish a single campaign...",14.4
"its really addicting and fun to play with your friends!",92.6
"love the game but i have the complete edititon and didnt the brave new world",25.1
"ive played basically every came in the sid meiers franchise. civ5 is a great installment, i like it better than civ4 especially with the brave new world expansion. i wish firaxis has spent more time on performance of the game engine -- it takes up a ton of system resorces especially in late game scenarios. but over all, really fun and has a good multiplayer experience although there are a few glitches.",69.8
"enjoy the game a lot, lots of way to win & i can save at any time so i can quit & come back as needed.",68.9
"civ 5 is an overall improvment to the formula. hexes and unstackable units improve the strategy. exploring culture and economy are great. i wish i had more time to play this!",330.2
"oh great fellow gamer, who awaits the next great pc streategy game with misty eyes. young was the gaming community when the great and powerful sid meier unleashed the civilization series unto the world. renowned all over the world for its depth and addictiveness, the franchise grew in stature with each passing installment. while others attempted to recapture its majesty, its glory could not be recreated. yet, amidst all this, the grandeur of civilization endured. now, you look to civilization 5 to once again claim that position on top of the world of strategy gaming. will it once again ensnare the sense of helpless gamers, or die with a whimper. oh wise and respected gamer, this great series once again years to be played for days on end. the choice is yours.",241.5

"one of my favourite strategy games, sometimes its all in your favor, other times you are getting  on. 10/10",190.0
"i have spent more time on this game than probably any other game ive ever played. if you can get the gods and kings expansion with it, but it stands up on its own well enough to warrant a purchase.",674.5
"great game to play with others or even solo just watch out for just one more turn syndrome. that one more turn can cost you hours! go buy it and play it!",169.5
"a very addicting game. youll find yourself thinking just one more turn indeed... ...to the point of forgetting how much time passed. i found myself thinking this would have a very high learning curve, after hearing all the strategy needed to play a civilization game (this is the first in the civ series that ive played), but soon found out that its not so bad once you get the hang of the gameplay.",48.8
"great game but it will be nice if you get a new leader with units and a bonus everytime your first one reaches its death",309.6
"time consuming and if you play with friends youre gonna have a good tiem.",67.3

"sid meier still get it, civ 5 is awesome ! with the first addon gods and kings it kicked civ4 from my favorite place of all civilization parts (played 1, net, 2, 3, 4 and 5). new tactics with a few changes like the hexagon fields on the map, only one military and only one civil unit on one field. great looking graphics and still one of the best gui i ever used in a strategie game. top !",524.2

"an amazing game for people who like stratagy games such as me",71.1
"i love tbs games, and this is a great one. theres so much replayability with a variety of victory conditions, loads of civs and scenarios, and mod support to fill in the gaps. hundreds of hours clocked on this, and i still come back to it. its easy to lose track of time with the just one more turn syndrome this game instills. id recommed getting with the brave new world and gods & kings dlc, they improve the core game immensely.",620.5

"i have been playing sid meiers games since civnet back in 1995. almost 20 years later, im still here. over the years there has been a huge decline in strat games but sid has kept realeasing these civ games for which i am eternally greatful. the game has changed drastically since the original, keeping it fresh and challanging. if you havnt played any of these games before, i would urge you to give them a go, they are one of the most rewarding experiances you could ever encounter in front of a screen.",138.8
"one of the best series of all times. this civilization v is not the best but does not disappoint either.",128.0
"beautiful, simple, crisp, and an amazing time sink. lose 4 hours in a blink and not care!",23.3
"a definite score, if you are able to obtain the game. the game dynamics are spot-on with cool animations. well thought-out game for any level of strategy gamer out there. it would rank up there on best games ive ever played. other than a few minor issues, the game is an easy 10/10!",262.6
"this game is fun if you like doing the same thing over and over again (like me) but if you buy this game, be sure to buy the brand new world along with it, because its not as challenging as it feels it should. almost all the good workshop content only works with the brand new world addition. the ais never build huge forces, only small 3 unit sized ones. so take my advice, and buy the brand new world as well, because this game alone is not worth $30. get the brand new world in the complete edition, cause youll only have to pay $50, not $60, and you get all that crazy stuff.",107.1
"love this game. infinite replayability! the mod engine is superb as well, allowing some impressive customizations.",461.3

"civ...effing civ! its addicting, deep and a great way to spend time when youre looking for some alone gaming time.",62.0
"this game has the ability to make hours turn into minutes! while the gameplay is a little simpler than is predecessors, it still has the classic civ ok, just one more turn.....ok, just one more feeling to it. some people claim that this game is a dumbed down and less complicated version of its predecessors, but this isnt a bad thing! civilization v keeps things straightforward and consise enough to be accessible to new players, but in depth enough to keep your inner control freak happy. balance is key, and this game has it in spades.",100.7
"good game too pass the time and many ways to play. highly reccomended!",36.9
"normally i would hate these kind of games but there is an exeption to civ as it gives you the freedom to create an empire based on your personnal prefferences, for example if you want to be an  then just declare war on everyone and base your gameplay around you military or then you can be peacefull and win with a science victory which basically involves using neuclear stuff to show dominance. the rate at which time goes by while playing civ is quite amazing to as it is impossible to know how long you have been playing as you become so fixed on the game. 10/10",46.4
"great barbarian simulator. did you say you had to disconnect from the host for a second? good, because you needed a few more cities. -a.i. ghandi was very happy to eradicate me using his stockpile of nuclear weapons. moving around in this game is almost as exciting as walking in dayz. 10/10 would recommend to fellow walking simulator fans.",83.4

"if you dont have ocd about historical accuracy and thoroughly enjoy tbs (turn-based strategy) games, then this is the game for you! control a major nation of your choice through the annals of history, from the unknowing stone age straight to the space age. every decision you make will shape your civ to what they can become.",159.2
"addicting and amazing is what i go by for this game. its more fun with friends, but when so, time becomes nonexistant. in one match i played 8 hours straight with 2 other friends. i still to this day have not played less than an hour in a match. you can create your own story. you can deceive. you can become allies with other countries. you can be selfish. its a game for any personality! i highly recommend!",19.3
"great game. very indepth andd quite extensive research trees. by far the best civ yet.",16.8
"its like drugs in game form. superbly easy to get addicted to, insanely hard to quit and uncanningly easy to fall back into if you somehow managed to quit (its like gravity, all it takes is a push). on top of that, its extremely detrimental to your health and social life. 10/10, would give up life again.",252.8
"this game is amazing! it is for sure my favorite strategy game of all time! the options of what you want to do with your empire is unlimited, you can conquer the world with an iron fist or let the arts flourish among your people. some things i would want to change but nothing you cant fix with a mod or two. i would definitely recommend this game.",121.3

"not enough time to finish this game dota is way better. - navi",25.7
"i love this game. absolutely a great experience to play with friends throughout all hours of the night. theres nothing like going up against numerous bots on the highest diffuculty and winning through teamwork.",79.9
"for all its issues, this game is so insanely fun either with friends or single-player",240.8
"recently, my computer had been having overheating problems, which kept me from playing games other than minecraft for more than a few minutes. this was the one i missed the most. civ v is easy to learn, but difficult to master. a good introduction to strategy games for someone as inexperienced as i was. despite my initial confusion and minor information overload, i found it rather simple to understand, and soon, i was playing it for fun against computers far more than with the friends that wanted to play with me in the first place. i played it so much that i got bored and played around with the things in the workshop. its really quite fun. in the end, it really is more fun with friends, so i would definitely recommend you learn from an experienced friend, if thats possible.",310.7
"great strategy game, very fun to play with friends.",143.6
"amazing game, can get you fixed for hours just building your cities up and dominating all opponents. the multiplayer is really fun too, not knowing what your friends are up to just teases you as you create your civilization.",64.7
"great game! worth every penny. i wont deny it can lag sometimes but overall performance is great and fun.",96.9
"probably the most fun ive had with my friends since halo on the computer. you can sit there all day relaxing pumping out a game of civ while you either beat each other to a pulp or wreck an ai all while shoving religion down peoples throats. plus where else can you get attila the hun vs george washington? didnt think so!",621.6
"im normally not into turn based strategy but let me tell you... this game will absorb your soul. i dont know what happened but when i exited my room, my family didnt know me, my house was being foreclosed, and my job had fired me. just warning you. +actual strategy. fun to win. -game length",8.3
"this is a vast improvement over the previous titles, and keeps you entertained for hours.",30.8
"i just realized i have about a months worth of play time invested in this game.",611.1
"civilization v is a very detailed strategy game with a fairly solid understanding of history and what one needs to manage as a world leader. it is a difficult game starting out, as there is a great deal to learn and understand, but once one gets used to the games mechanics, it really immerses the player in the experience of running a civilization. this game is a fun time-killer solo and an even better game to play with friends. i particularly love mods, available through the steam workshop, which enhance the solo experience. i recommend getting mods to add religions, as i always find it amusing adopting satanism or cult of the illuminati. overall, i give this game a 8/10. its definitely worth checking out, and though other similar strategy games have their own asthetics that make them fun, this is probably the most realistic and detailed game amongst its peers.",234.6
"just one more turn, then ill call it a night..... eehh one more turn.... wait, when did p.m turn into a.m?",75.2
"civilization v is a great game, full of enormous maps and intricate politics that will keep your intrigue sated throughout the ages that your civlization achieves. i cant exactly recommend that you play it with friends, but it can be a great game to play by yourself.",103.2
"a must have for your pc collection. best paired with the gods and kings expansion.",226.3

"civilization v is a symbol heavy turn based strategy game, in which you pick one of many powerful historic civilizations and try to conquer the world either through science, diplomacy, culture or my favorite; military. this game is heavily tipped towards military conquest. your civilization progresses from era to era, strengthening its forces and expanding its borders. you meet and come into conflict with many historical figures such as queen elizabeth of england and alexander the great of rome.you research science revolutions to give your people an edge over other civilizations, these revolutions are like the invention of the wheel and the invention of combustion. this game has many great aspects and if you love strategy games i highly recommend it. 9 out of 10 - game slayer review",59.5

"say goodbye to all of your friends...im very sad...not really...cause civilization 5 is my only friend!",63.2
"good game... but today only in sp. multiplayer is kindda uplayable. every 5 turn someone disconnect and yo cant play map bigger than small, because when more than 6 players on the map game dont catching up and every turn = loading. still freezes and dropping connections. ai in multiplayer is totaly dumb and dont even interact with you unless you do. this game would deserve a lot more attension from developers, but they are actually doing new civ which, i hope will not end like this one. still i really recomend this game for its last turn addiction and great replayability. but that multiplayer is a shame. :/",272.4
"hitler, stalin maybe mao. when you enter this game, basic history education will have tried to teach you that these people are naughty men. of course, you never could, because they were dead. i f you really want to hate historical figures this is the game for you. ujust remember... ramkhamhaeng is an !",1013.8
"i personally have never seen strategic or click appealing or fun but i can hands down say civ v is addictive, immersive, and an all round amazing game. especially is you have 2 or 3 friends to play it with! 11/10",27.4
"once again the franchise delivers the just one more turn addiction in one of the best turn based strategy games ever! a huge departure from civ iv that actually works well and provides many hours of fun despite the deceptively simple new interface. a must have for anyone who likes turn based strategy games!",271.8
"oh god civ v what have you done with my last 14 hours? they just disappeared!",953.6
"incredibly addictive. very fun even without dlc or mods. multiple ways to complete the game. you can destroy your enemys with an iron fist or win with poltical or scientific power. each playthrough is different due to maps many different characters with different abilitys which can by very useful to some people or none at all to others it just depends on what your style is. only a few complaints but they are quit small and not worth mentioning. dont buy this game if you dont have alot of spare time! if you do you that you should of been doing something useful once you have completed the game and trust me games last a long time. i recommend it to all ages. five stars",70.6
"havent been captivated like this by a game in a very long time. the scope is epic and the struggles & rewards are gratifying. just one more turn!",25.9
"civ v, visually more attractive than previous civs, seems not as immersive and deep. the addition of ranged units that can attack across multiple tiles is nice, the city states and barbarians are interesting. definitely worth picking up this game if you catch it on sale, but when its at full price, stick with previous versions.",433.6
"a lot of fun to play. warning though time will fly while playing this game",28.3
"in my opinion the best strategy game out there. a must own!!!",83.7
"it is as good as they say. my fav civ ii, actually. i am not entirely in love with how picking a government is set up (it is a bit too gamey, in a way, and you dont have the sense of being anything in particular) but the rest on the game is pure gold.",87.7
"grand-strategy game that consumes more of your hours than is healthy. just one more turn easily turns into 5 hours. not for people looking for a quick-and-dirty strategy game like starcraft.",183.3
"i could easily lose my entire life to civ. makes for strange conversations trying to explain to people whats happening, so worth it.",31.9
"excellent game for anyone who enjoys complex startegy games. the learning curve is pretty steep but the game itself is incredibly fun to learn and play. a critique i would make of the game however is its balancing in terms of the civilosations that can be played, but this is pretty minor. overall a fun game.",141.2
"sid meiers civilization v is an excellent strategy game where each player makes there own empire and tries to win the game! its excellent on your own or with friends! 10/10 brandon times.",255.2

"if your a fan of multiple choices than this is your game. even though there is no campaign there are thousands of ways to play and all of them have their own benifts. if you choose to kill and  everone than youll town will be unhappy and rebel or you could be a peaceful sceintific civilization and life in harmony, you choose and thats what i like, the choices.",99.3
"awesome game, i mean after i got this i palyed if for a solid hour and never got bored. (edit: solid 6 hours aparently time dosnt exist in this world)",21.9
"a great updated version of a classic game. in depth, great graphics, an amazing game.",180.6

"hours and hours of screaming at the netherlands for dancing around your borders with their units or at babylon for the never-ending wave of denounciations and war declaration. desperate research to stay on top and brown-nosing to appease the city-states. frustration. blood, sweat and tears. worth it?",115.5
"world domination is the best domination. conquer at will and send all the hippies to hell.",96.2
"i havent visited this venerable series since civ 1 or 2, cant even remember. im pleased to say the latest offering is everything i could hope for in a franchise that keeps sticking around.",17.6
"this game taught me to not mess with a man in a diaper because a man like that has nothing to lose. he will nuke you and feel nothing. 10/10",346.3
"if someone could donate me all of the dlc, i will shove a marijuana needle up your  out of love <3",197.7
"i love this game. i feel that for some people, it is incredibly hard, but if you keep at it then you get better. much, much better. the fun that this game provides is worth hours upon hous of gamelay. reccommended, 5 stars.",169.3
"game of the year. game of all years. this is the half-life 3 of strategy games.",421.7

"phenomenal game. have over 100 hours and it still gets better everytime i play.",502.4
"i do love this game and if you want an enjoyable game to play i definitely recommend civ 5.",209.9

"very fun game, i livestreamed it and people loved it :d",56.5
"where you blow everyone up with nuclear bombs 11/10",88.1
"this has been one of my favorite games ive played and has been incredibly addiciting. the amount of detail and work that went into this game is extraordinary. while i did play civilization iv before, this game seemed entirely new and revamped. it is somewhat dificult to learn because of its complexity but once learned is a very entrenching and enjoyable game. my one complaint would be some issues with the ai in that there are many times in which units forget what they were automated to do. very fun game, nontheless.",113.6
"i love this game. for a not-so-avid civilization player, this was a great start. some civ iv players will argue about the quality of this game, but if youre new to the franchise, its definitely worth a try.",131.7
"a very strategic-based, turn-based war game... lots of different choices and ways to build your cities and armies, as well as allying with or seiging city-states and lots more too.",124.3
"playing this game for about three months or so, i figured out the possiblities of discovering new worlds, fighting civilizations, and using extraordinary mods to play the game appeal to me. however, i find the game very time consuming, as one would have to move their units one by one and especially the processing time is long. overall, i find this game interesting, creative, and enjoyable. 4/5",233.3
"besides my constant crashing its a pretty fun game",55.6
"if you like history and ghandi acting like an a*hole, sid meiers civilization v was made for you!",133.2
"its the quintessential strategy game. if you love strategizing, then this game is absolutely, 100% for you. if you dont love strategy games, then it is 100% not.",264.7
"was expecting this game to be very similar to civ 4 with a few minor upgrades, boy was i wrong. seems like it was completely overhauled and for the better, already wasted one weekend stuck in it, and heres to many more! 10/10!",19.1
"a very good game ,very well built. its very enjoyable and the multipalyer mode makes it one of the most addictive turn based stratergy games.....",19.2
"great game! tho have like 6 - 12hrs to play as the games last forever!",38.8
"great game but much better with mods. would love to see the makers learn from the modders of the community and use their ideas as well as their own to make civiliztion 6 even better",179.2
"you see this profile picture? this was my face when i first met the zulu. do you know what my first words were after i met them oh god i hope one of these other nations isnt ghandi. why did i ask that? because that  doesnt care about peace, he only wants to create fallout 4 set in your cities. this was also my face when i got my first science victory. oh my god, you can send that  into space in the year 1900 for christs sake. who does that. and dont even get me started on that british  elizabeth. strongest navy in the world my . overall 20/10 semi-decent game",132.8
"had game for 1 and a half day total play time = 30 hours. breakfast = a hobnob. good day sir",50.7
"took a while to get used to as this game is quite different from its predecessor; however, i felt that this is one of the best ever in the series.",470.3
"laid back, slow-pased strategy game. its a bit of a combination between the board games: risk, and colonists of catan. for me its the ideal game to pass a weekend where you just dont feel like getting away from your computer. even if its still 30 euros. very much worth it.",104.0
"i recommend civ 5. yeah, initially i was skeptical. zomg they simplified civ 5 you s! but honestly? a lot of that was simply fat trimmed from a swaggering, bloated cow. the core game has needed a rather serious refactoring, particularly military units which civ 5 addresses. not perfectly, mind you, but i like the direction it is taking. and yes i know its civ v not civ 5, but that just sounds like some kind of disparaging slang. you civvie!",72.7
"this game is just plain awesome. it is endless fun, and it wont feel repetitive. you can play hour on end, always say youre going to do one more turn but then you never do",511.5
"this game will end your life. get it at your own risk.",101.8
"amazing game you could spend hours on and would still be entertaining. with new mods always being added there is always something new to try.",509.4
"like heroin. avoid if you have even a slightly addictive personality...",1017.8
"can feel a little boring/slow at times, but over all a great game. 4/5",252.8
"civilization v is a legendary game among turn-based strategy games. as you know, every game has own game mechanics which make the game playable and enjoyable. i highly recommend you to read game guide before starting to understand civilization vs game mechanics. civilization v will join one of the best game of yours.",13.0
"great game but i got a new computer and dont no how to install it on there",379.7
"great game for pure strategy fans. ive been playing this game for years.",99.1
"this game is truely, the king of just one more turn. great game and amazing new options with the expansions.",238.1
"easily one of my favorite games, but beware! most begin playing and then realize 10 hours later that they should really go to bed or work or something, but you just gotta finish this war or found that last city and get your happiness up. its easy to fall down the hole of ill just take this one last turn and then im turning it off and continue to do that for hours. great game. if you love strategy games, youll love civ v. highly recommend the gods and kings and brave new world bundles which will really expand your game play options and keep it fresh.",365.1
"in all honesty, a game that is fun for the first few days but got boring really fast. there was no editor and really nothing else to do but the campaign. the mods were fun and entertaining for a long period but also got boring. not game worth 60$ but if they added some extra stuff i would definately buy it for 60$ again.",413.0
"mixed feelings: pros: -its civil. it has been simplified on some parts, but is good. -nice graphics. cons: -unbearable wait times. i really mean it. on a huge map, on advanced turns it took about 10 minutes to just load a saved game! and about 5 minutes each turn just waiting the machine thinks. -very bad diplomacy. its almost impossible to get a balanced deal. the computer always want to have a very unbalanced deal. -no spies, no sharing tech between cultures. -spain as a dlc?! come on, they were one of the main cultures on every civil. the wait times killed the whole thing. it cant be possible that it took too long each turn to think.",166.0
"sid meier is back with civ v. after a rocky start with the base game, the two expansions gods and kings and brave new world add the meat back to the civilization hot pocket. recommended with gods and kings minimum.",200.4
"quite addictive and a good bit of historical fun if you like turn-based games. they did a great job.",7.8
"man this is a good game but barabarians can easily make your game a living hell. also, other civs will get real mad for settling like five tiles away. what the heck is up with that.",63.3
"amazing game. you have to give it quite a bit of time until you see it at its best. the game is graphically appealing and its gameplay is highly addictive. you might find some rough spots but they dont take away from the experience. give it a try, you wont regret it.",62.7
"even after 15h of play, i can see that i will have hundreds of hours of play in the future.",25.7
"probably just not for me, it is pretty annoing to wait constanty for my turn to move units around and do things. i will be much happier if there were and mode to just get rid of this tours.",4.0
"dont by this . you would be lucky if it is playable, or onlucky like me. spending 5 hours to figure out why the game freezes. i sometimes have small problems with a new game, but nothing like this. im shure there exist a possible way to make it work, but it is not worth the time and effort. this is a game that is not finnished, its full of bugs and issues. its frustrating, once you think you fixed the problem.. another one appear. search the internet for civ 5 problems - before you by it. and dont by it.",48.1
"great turn-based game, although bit can be a little slow at times.",35.7
"it is a great game, i dont really see any flwas and its straightforward. since it is turn based it is pretty slow so i would recommend being patient and having alot of time to just finish one whole game.",54.7
"before this game i had never played any civilization game and i decided to try it as the gold edition was on a huge sale. im not disappointed the game is pretty fun, but if you dont have much time on your hands i dont recommend this game at all even a quick match can take several hours. there is no story mode the game only features online play with players with a choice of ai to fill empty slots and single player vs only ai. if you enjoy games like this i highly recommend this game.",115.3
"this game reminds me of this one time i stayed at a motel 8...... and thats why you always open a can of fish bottoms first.",86.8
"i absouletly love this game. this is by far the best civ game in the franchaise. now that they added trade routes and all that good stuff, makes the game more realistic... i give this game 10 out of 10. i would recommend this game 100 times over.. it is kind of slow to start but it does pick up once you hit the medevil era.",174.5
"welcome to time sink: the game. entire civilizations and eons will spawn and die. then suddenly you look up at the clock and realize youre late for your own funeral. theres a save button? no. there cant be. the only save is victory!",41.0
"this is a good sim if you wannt to play and control a civ! i actually havnt played a whole lot of it and its been very far and in between but i enjoy it when i do play it.",145.1
"its a very cool and informative game you guys should check it out.",228.3
"i have played enough to say my opinion. this game is amazing in every single way. from war to science. just amazing :d and to make it even better :d try to challenge yourself. difficulty to the top :d recommended",67.7
"be george washington, kill ghandi. seriously what else is there that you need to know?",5.8
"absolutely love this game. truly makes you feel like the ruler of a civilization with unlimited potential.",433.9
"yeah great game if you like stratergy. but this may be the game to get you in to stratergy",345.8
"this honestly has to be one of the best games ever written... middle aged mba educated widely read guy here, and i derive intense intellectual stimulation and learning from this game. sid meir is a genius. he just maps out how civilisations really work so well.",245.6
"at this point in time, this is my second favourite game, of all time. this game is nigh upon the perfection of turn-based strategy, beautifully constructed, this will completely envelop your time, should you enjoy the game, with i find highly likely. thus far ive been unable to amount many hours, but i can assure you, that will change. the expansion packs for the game add massive amounts of content, that only serve to make this already magnificent game better. recreating history reaches its pinnacle in this masterpiece. buy it. play it. live it.",76.9
"the team at feraxis have really out done themselves with this amazingly designed time sink which will leave you telling yourself you must play for one more turn.",187.2
"best epic game ever, i have been playing this game since 1998! love it and probably always will but just like in the great shel silversteins - the giving tree, like the old man i keep running out of time but the game is always there to play.",233.7
"masterpiece. thats it. no need no 1,000 page novel stating why the game is great. it just is.",18.0
"this game is absolutely amazing. iv sunk hundreds of hours into this game. absolutely massive replay value. something new each time!",284.2
"i have been playing sid meiers civilization ever since it came out on dos. civ v follows the same formula that stood the test of time in any turn based 4x games. with the addition of steamworkshop, the modding community, expect hundreds of fun time playing,experimenting and wasting hours. just....one.....more......turn and its already morning.",29.2
"there is a reason why civilization has defined the strategy game genre for over two decades. its not just because, like chess, its simple to learn and complex to master. its not that it brings out your inner ruler/warlord/diplomat like no other game. its because, in addition to all this, ruling an empire in civ is more fun than sitting naked in a roller-coaster and more addictive than heroin-induced coffee. in other words, playing civ is an experience. with civilization v, the series updates many stagnated issues (ref: unit stacking) and takes a leap into new areas (ref: social edicts). highly recommended, even for those who thought civ 4 was the high-point.",30.1
"wonderful strategy game! ive already beeb addicted to it",72.8
"i cant find the right words to explain how i feel about this game. its just...just perfect.",123.8
"civilization is really solid. you get sucked in and cant help but keep playing turn after turn. many hours of sleep were lost because i just had to get one more turn completed... and then another. 9/10",347.0
"very catchy, well designed turn-based strategy i spent over 24 hours on in 3 days. i was kinda surprised how much fun it was to play it. so far, i played only multiplayer, so i cant comment campaign. early phase of game is very dynamic, its little bit more lazy in late game. pros are also very nice graphics, which are pleasing the eye. a small con is quite high hardware requirement for turn-based strategy generally. hosting a late game with a lot of troops was quite pain even on decent gaming computer.",83.0
"sid meiers civilization v is an excellent game with endless replayability. if you enjoy turn-based strategy games or enjoy the concept of the civilization series, this game is for you.",271.1
"highly addictive turn based strategy game. will have you up all night and you wont even realize. i bought this game and started playing at 8pm... next thing i knew it was 7am and the sun was coming up. try the demo but it doesnt do it justice.",97.3
"very good. you will play for 20 minutes and notice that 2 hours have past. play this game!",34.4
"looks stupid but is really fun and i usualy hate stratagy games.",9.2
"this is a fantastic game for losing large amounts of your time too. time you may or may not have. also is great fun",81.1
"one of these magic games where you try to play half of hour but end up playing it whole night.",8.6
"i have been playing civilization games for a long time, and am very impressed with this version. i have played many hours and enjoy it every time i play it. i would highly recommend this game to anyone.",117.8
"um...its civilization. this game...ive been playing it since high school. so yeah. love it.",154.0
"awesome game. it kinda takes a while to get into but after that its really fun. it is sort of a one sided game though. only certain people will find it entertaining. basically you take control of a civilization and command it. you can train troop units and can research new things once you advance into the future. all up it is basically a fun history lesson.",11.5
"highly recommended if you have played any of ther other civilizations and love a good complex strategy game.",140.3
"this game is the most fun management game ever. i dont think i could ever insult it 2143621341234123432/10",17.3
"had i have none how amazing civ 5 is i would have bought it a long time ago. i was lucky enough to catch this game when it was 75% off during a steam sale. this is my #1 game of 2013 (even though it came out in 2010). if you wait for the next sale (or look else where for a sale i.e., greenmangaming), or decide to buy it at full retail price. either way civilization v is worth it at any price. pick this game up!",269.8
"yes just yes. if your a fan of stratagy games this is a must.",120.4
"an excellent new addition to the ever young series. many hours have been lost playing it.",593.1
"this is a very fun strategy game and one of the best ive played. it has a more in depth research and construction side to it then most stragety turn based games i have played. plus you can nuke cities as you see fit, icbms are pretty sweet",145.4
"it can be either a very casual game or you can make it a very intense and strategic turn based strategy, and that is what i love about this game.",204.4
"excellent game.i started playing on civ 2 and have played each one (2,3 &4) to death, i expect that civ 5 will be the same. :)",101.9
"civilization 5 and its expansions are the best game for strategist to date. there is tons of gameplay with the different ai levels. its easy to get into as a newbie and also alot of difficulty for the experinced. i played obver 800 hours of this game because its the perfect strategy game of 2013 (brave new world)",954.7
"an excellent game that you will revisit time and time again. great to play with friends playing with them or against them. the expansions make a good amount of difference to the gamelplay, so much that i find myself unable to enjoy playing the standard version of civilization v! i would recommend getting the gold edition whilst the game is on sale, and then purchasing brave new world on top. there are some issues with bugs, including; the game reloading in online games, sometimes when you save a multiplayer game and rejoin there was an issue with not getting the right civ and other small anoiances. overall this is a great game, especially those new to the 4x genre, like i was. the ui is easy great, the mechanics are enjoyable and the game feels very polished. i woulkd recommend this game to anyone!",229.7
"one of the best turn-based strategy games ive played. whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player. it is suitable for anyone who is a tactically based gamer.",200.8
"this game is an amazing investment, especially if you get the two mods a brave new world and gods and kings. i bought the compelte edition though and am loving it, one of the best investments you could possibly make in the videogame market since it is extremely replayable and can spend countless hours playing it.",184.0
"this game is amazing, the expansions made it one of the best turn based strategy games out there",36.0
"amazing game if you like turn-based strategic gameplay. gets way better with the expansions though, vanilla is fun but lacks a lot of gameplay elements that are added by g&k and bnw.",71.5
"honestly the best game on my steam list. buy it, play it and love it.",100.2
"the concept of one more turn has no meaning here. fantastically addictive game. 10/10 would play again.",380.9
"just one more turn! no, you wont close your game after this turn, the turn after, and the turn after the turn! its just addicting that you wont even pay attention to how long you have spent in the last session.",248.8
"im mainly doing this to earn a ticket in the steam summer sale. however, civ5 is an awesome game if you like turn based strategy games. the multiplayer is a lot more fun than the singleplayer since you end up with an intelligent ally. if anyone picks this up, message me and we can play a few games.",600.6
"amazing game, extremely customizable, simple to complex, one of the best turn based strategy games ever made.",131.7
"i havent plaed it dlc free but with gode and kings or brave new world it is amazing",208.6
"this game is a great game that can teach you the great history of the world. of course you create our own history, but things like wonders, tech, and war are the same as always. this civ 5 lets you race for technology, land, resources and etc. sometimes you get backstabbed by your loyal ally, or sometimes you are the backstabber. this game letts you set up your civilization the ay you want to, and create the ultimate world power.",399.4
"whats to say? great 4x game... ai is total trash as once you know how it works, its easy to manipulate. playing against people is the only way to play, but takes a lot of time, so hard to get the friends together for a game. would recommend to anyone to get civ5 and bnw expansion on steam sale, dont pay full price.",112.8
"good game that you can spend hours on, especially if you have the add ons, and the mods",134.4
"i bought this game due to gameplay from the yogscast and it was one of the best choices ever this game is so addicting. i have never had more fun in a strategic game definetley a must buy! 20/10",130.6
"great fun if you take time to learn how everthing works.",35.6
"a phenomal game that will make you appreciate history. prepare to spend many hours playing this game.",122.4
"not much else to say about this game that hasnt been said. great all a round game, one of my favorites of all time.",138.3
"every time i see it being played, or something reminds me of civilization, ive got to start playing again. and i generally do for a few weeks again, and its fun every single time. to me its the best iteration of the series so far, mostly because of one unit per tile, and i wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone",351.4
"pretty good game if looking for a long casual game to play through",417.1
"great game to suck some time overall. there are some bugs it seems as you build your empire, the larger it gets the more often there are lag issues in processing turns.",264.0
"this is by far one of the best strategy games out there. i believe it is a huge improvement over civ 4. the dlc has touched most of what people had wrong with the game, however the best parts are some of those improvements over civ 4, such as no unit stacking.",83.0
"always invites you to play just one more turn.. and another..",75.3
"its streamlined but that doesnt mean its bad. troop management on the field is more important now with the stacking roops being gone and cities being able to defend themselves.",59.4
"turn based strategy good graphics smooth gameplay. good if you have time to kill....",134.4
"this game was the first game i ever got on steam and it is still the game i play the most. even without all of the dlc, this game will ruin your nights if you play it before you go to bed. i strongly reccommend getting the brave new world dlc because it gives you features that make hundreds of more replays possible. 10/10.",109.3
"great social strategy game. the engine creates a pretty easy-going sort of playstyle. artwork is decent, and so is variety. the diplomacy in the game does not have much depth to it, and creating a lasting alliance with another faction is a rarity. there is also the problem with turn processing, at later turns (150+), you may aswell tab out of the game, as you might be waiting over 5 minutes for the game to end the turn and start a new one. still very enjoyable, 8/10.",123.2
"a fun game to play, especially with friends. the dlc makes the game all the more enjoyable too. i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rtss similar to age of empires.",59.2
"if you like turn-based strategy, this game will give you hours of fun. this game will bring out your inner general. 9/10",90.6
"one of the best rts games ive ever seen and played.",208.1
"hands down my favorite game series ever and it keeps improving and expanding.",175.0
"another great game in the civilization series. a few small issues that were fixed with the expansions. worth a try if you are a fan of the series",36.9
"extremely addictive and engaging. and if you think youve done it all in the vanilla game, add ons like brave new world changes the gameplay and victory conditions dramatically. by the very virtue that ive clocked in 260 hrs on the game says a lot doesnt it. but dont just take my word for it. give it a try. youll definitely have no regrets. :)",298.1
"one of the best games ive ever played. i learned things about ghandi i have never known. endless amount of fun and a new game every time you click play.",145.6
"very addicting game, you better have a minimum of 5-8 hours to spare. there so many things to focus on with gods & kings + brave new world expansion; that it bring out some intersting style of play. highly recommended p.s. the longer the game, the lag will slowly creep up..no one is safe. also ghandi + nukes 11/10",74.2
"sunk hundreds of hours into it. cant say much other then im addicited, its become the game i play while listening to podcasts. the only thing i dislike about the game is that one turn before i build a wonder some  of a civ beats me to it, frustrates the everlasting  out of me. oh well, the expansions gods and kings as well as brave new world turn this into a really fantastic civ game.",311.7
"very addictive lost alot of time on this enjoy the early stages seaching the world and get new stuff can be annoying when u haveto get 25 citys to all bluid buildings",88.1
"love playing rts games. its not a surprise when i lose full days in this game.",55.9
"this game is one of my favourites of all time. having racked up plenty of game time, its clear, from my point of view, that the game is addicting and will chew through hours and hours of your free time once you start playing. 10/10, would buy.",459.6
"fun game! i very much recommend this for casual and competative play. just make sure you clear your schedule for the whole night. you can save your game and start again but time flies and aint nobody got time for that.",219.8
"one more turn turns into 40 more turns. incredibly addicting",112.4
"ive been playing the civ franchise from the start, and this is another fine addition to the line.",142.6
"ghandi-is-an- simulator 2014. 11/10 would get nuked by ghandi again.",12.6
"i fell in love with this game the second i played it.",91.7
"best game i have ever played - would love to see a civ vi, and thered need to be some definite tweaks to this game firstly, trade glitch needs patching asap for sure. but besides that this is the best game in the world.",529.0
"id tell you everything, but first let me have just one more turn...",187.1
"great game, but there are some features frome the last game i wish that they intergated into this one.",431.3
"great game, its really easy to lose track of time when playing it. nothing like world domination to get through the day.",40.5
"this game along with all previous entries in the civilization franchise has a way of stealing large chunks of my life, and i dont really mind. :)",205.7
"ive been a fan of this table game from the original release in 1991 through the upadtes and even alpha centauri. i must admit that v is my fav version so far. for strategy players its beautiful graphics are skin phenomenon (although welcome), but what i really like is the gameplay balance. many things are more straight-to-the-point compared to the pervious releases, without losing depth. civ v is addictive, immense fun and a great time burner. i can only recommend as well as packing cold food for one week with ya if you are fan of the turn-based strategies and new to this one.",224.3
"if you area fan of any time of stratgey game weather it be real-time or turn by turn, civ 5 and it expansions are a game to certianly pick up. dont fall for the new reskin that they are putting out (beyond earth). civ 5 will be around for a long time",148.4
"fantastic update to the civ. franchise. i love the variety that the newly added civs bring to the table.",231.6
"it really doesnt get any better or more polished than civ5 11/10",641.9
"this game is very addictive and very fun. grab it when it goes on sale and say goodbye to your free time :d",72.2
"with bnw, civ has recovered from its unengaging start and demonstrates the spirit of the franchise: just one more turn...",535.8
"great game to start into the franchise even if youve never played previous installments. i would also recommend getting the expension as it fixes a lot of minor inconvenience from the main game. pros - interesting unique ability from each civ - smart different type of ai (conqueror passifism etc) - each game is different from the last playthrought - more to come con - once you become too aggressive, there is no redeeming yourself - no defense against certain things (ie : atomic weapon) - ai is smart, but single minded, they should change with time",619.8
"thoroughly love the game. i find myself always coming back to it.",465.3
"like its predecessors before it civv is another example of just one more turn addiction.",229.8
"definitely worth a purchase with the xpacs, cannot wait for civ in space!",148.8
"great game. highly addictive so be prepared to spend quite a bit of time on it.",213.2
"i buyed this game on my windows vista laptop before. but i change my os from the windows vista to ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 now. and it still could play through the steam platform. its so great. it is better if this game has the tradational chinese transation version.",7.0
"before i bought this on steam i played it for at least 150 hours... and still have racked up 56 hours. and if it wasnt for my job and other real life responsibilities i probably would be back up to 150 hours haha. anyway this game is amazing. if you enjoy strategy and civilization type games where you start from nothing aka nomadic times and work your way up through the ages to the modern era and future era you will absolutely love this game. although i will say if you get this game you must get gods and kings because it pretty much made the game 10x better with religion, spies and all the new  they added to it. get this game.",109.3
"amazing! i played the original one when it came out in 1994 and they are still the best turn based game in history",345.5
"one of the best games ive played in a while. the bnw dlc adds some interesting gameplay elements in addtion to finely tuning the rest of the game.",282.9
"this game is amazing. easy to learn but difficult to master, with tons of replayability. reccomended to anyone who might be on the fence, whether you are a hardcore strategy fan or new to the genre, there is something for you here.",142.7
"one of the best strategy games ever. though im still yearning for the test of time...",121.4
"i love this game. except when my friend nukes me after an epic game when im about to win. if this were a review for my friends, itd say not recommended. but its for the game, and for that i easily say thumbs up.",248.5
"absolutely addictive. easy to pick up and play even if you arent that into strategy games, its probably the best strategy game ive ever played. easily 9/10 for the base game, with the expansions its easily 10/10.",15.5
"the pinnacle in round based empire building. spent far too many hours on this one :p",43.4
"check this out with the new expansion, it may have fixed the issues that you had with it at first. i loved it then and still love it.",126.2
"this is about the 5th time ive stayed up untill 4:00 am playing civ v. i hate myself for buying this game.",243.3
"i was incredibly sceptical about this game, being a long time total war player, i didnt know if i was going to be able to adapt to civilizations style of gameplay. but boy was i wrong. civilization 5 is absolutely entralling. the ability to carve out your own story, without any restrictions, and build a vast empire over a beautifully design map is more than enough to entice the most stubborn of rts fans who have refused to move away from their own beloved strategy game. a must own for all strategy fans. 10/10",11.9
"warning: game is listed as an addictive substance. do not touch if you want to get anything done.",30.5
"great game if you love strategy games. the dlcs are great too.",160.5
"just got it from a friend, fun game when you are bored.",44.4
"this game took my friends from me. ill get them back in just one more turn...",415.3
"sooooo the other day me and a few friends decied to play a game of civ. and after a bit i looked at how long we were playing and it said 1023 minutes which is roughly 17 hours... i guess time does fly when youre having fun!",155.9
"a worthy update to civ4s impressive legacy. just be sure to get all the expansions as well.",807.5
"when this game came out a lot of people panned it for cutting features from civ 4 and being a shallower experience overall. looking at the game and the aspects that were only added in dlc, i can definitely see where those complaints came from, but with the gods and kings and brave new world expansions i think this game is a worthy entry in the series. it is kind of terrible that you have to pay thirty bucks each for two expansions to get the full experience, but if you can catch it in a sale i dont think youll regret it.",39.8
"kind of boring and tedious, the leaders stay alive for 1000 years its like rise of nations but much slower paced",6.7
"i thought i will just try the game once when i was 18. i am 22 now and am still trying the game, i dont intend to play the game though.",95.0
"decided to purchase civ on sale after reading an article that placed it in the top 10 pc games you have to play. if you want a game with complex systems, 0 explaination but strangely addictive, this is the game for you. i find it extremely boring, but just played for 5 hours.",7.7
"the best game. teaches you how to run for world leader and allows you to slaughter alexander of greece cuz that guys a .",162.4
"without the expansions, this game is indeed fun, but pretty lackluster as well, especially when comparing it to civ iv. however, add gods and kings and brave new world, and you get an extremely fun strategy game. singleplayer has its pros, such as being moddable, but, in my opinion, nothing beats the fun you can have with friends, either working together, competing with each other, or warring with each other.",307.9
"why like history if you can play and change it. rule the world as the most capitalistic russia you will ever see. or as the most be a north american dictator. so much choice, so much conquer to do!!!",259.1
"whats not to like about this game? oh wait, the end-game lag with all the units in the map, maybe... if you like turn-based strategy games, this game is definately for you to enjoy. but there are so many ways to conquer others in civ v, its just countless. (cant really spoil what you can build, because its that awesome) oh yeah, also, there are many vanilla mods that you can get for this game, i would recommend browsing over the mods and see what you can get. also, the expansions bnw and g&k both enhances and changes up the gameplay 10 fold, you might as well think that civ v with the expansions would be a new game (also the mods made for the expansions are to die for). (just fyi, you cant play your mods in multiplayer, not without coding your game yourself and made sure your friends code theirs as well)",297.0
"great game if you have alot of spare time to play!",184.1
"i rarely enjoy strategical games in the long run. usually stop playin them after 1-2 hour of gameplay. but this game got me hooked, specially the online part of it. playin against or teamin up with friends is so much fun. this is not a game you wanna play 20 min before going to bed, you will sit all night long then xd quotin another reviewer: just one more turn..... ",66.2
"one of the best games ever, and its better than ever...",213.6
"gamers should marry gamers. and if that happens, playing hot seat civilization v with the wife counts a spending quality time together :)",846.1
"epic - if youre not that in to fps games and such and like a good thinker and strategy with a civilization thats constant developing their tech to kill an enemy or get loved by the ppl then i recommend that you buy this game now while its on sale on steam!!!",95.8
"with the brave new world expansion this becomes literally the best point in the series. no stacks of doom, trading, religion, tourism...only thing missing is that espionage could be a bit more fleshed out, with spy units that could poison water and sabotage and whatnot.",123.4
"ter r lats of octagones nd  but ovral its a pretii gud game",46.1
"best game of the series yet! make sure to get the main expansions, makes it a lot better",107.4
"great game! i always have great time playing it....",799.1
"a complex turn-based strategy game that is worth every penny especially with all the dlcs! there isnt a campaign mode but more of a set your own kind of game however there are scenarios you can play. just remember to never trust ghadi he will nuke you!",376.6
"if you like solid strategy games, then this game is definitely for you. historical, fun, and with many different ways to win, this is a game that consistantly engages you for one last click.",133.6
"a really fun strategy game, good for when you have spare time to kill",200.1
"just one more turn and im going to bed! i like it, this is great game!",205.3
"this game sucks hours out of your life. 10/10 would buy again",427.5
"i have been in love with civ since i played the timeless civ ii. whilst civ v will never capture the simplicity of civ ii it is certainly worth the investment especially if on sale. the add ons do add a lot so it is worth checking those out too.",8.3
"excellent game, first game of mine from civilization series and i have really enjoyed my time playing this game.",339.6
"this is my favourite game at the moment, and has been for quite some time!",20.6
"for strategy! this is a really plus game! form the league of superfriends with your favourite civilizations! declare war on poland! outpopulate india and china! form nato with russia! get backstabbed by france and greece! france:  y u haff to be mad, it only game . yeah france, well screw you. ( no seriously get this game its good )",572.6
"top 4 drugs never to do in life.....crack cocaine, heroin, meth and civ v",20.9
"this game is a ton of fun if you like strategy. the original game is awesome but if you want the complete package get the two dlc packs to get religion and trading. if you like carefully avoiding war by keeping trade lines running between other civilizations or just want to crush everyone else on the map with blitzkrieg or nuclear warfare then this is the game to you. when the base game gets old(which it wont for a while) there are scenarios like the fall of rome or the civial war, and then there are tons of mods! truly an epic game for multiplayer or singelplayer. the only con i have is that games can take forever to get good.",67.4
"civ 2 10/10 <-- og civ 5 9/10 <--- achievements!! alpha centauri 9/10 <--- epic!! civ 4 ? <-- not played yet... civ 1 6/10 <-- started the series, so it gets some credit... civ 3 1/10 <-- worst civ by far!",857.6
"this is a really good game for those who like to strategize and dont mind games that take a while. so if you like strategy and have a good amount of time, then i really think this is for you.",25.6
"as a person who hasnt played a previous installment of civilization, i found it very easy to learn the systems and gameplay and was easily able to have fun with no frustration to what i originally thought to be an overly complex game. while there is certainly complexities for long-time civ fans, it is very easy to pick up and play as a beginner 5/5 the nuances of this game make it a challenge for veterans of the series and simple/fun enough for beginners to play on lower difficulties.",89.5
"when people point to console exclusives and say the pc doesnt have any i simply point to civilization v, the civilization series is the best strategy franchise ever. youll feel like an evil mastermind as you plot world domination, and the expansion packs gods and kings, as well as brave new world bring new life to an old game.",299.6
"one of the best games i have ever played. the learning curve is sort of high, but once you get the hang of what exactly you are supposed to be doing you will love it. this is the kind of game that just sucks you into it and hours pass by without you even knowing. simply amazing, hats off to the developers.",175.2
"very good game graphics awesome gameplay pretty good, style perfect it just falls on one thing 50 bucks for a game that got 69! now im not saying bnw is bad but it doesnt improve the gameplay so amazingly that its worth more than half the game price it doesnt double how much u play it!",487.4

"some nice changes from civ iv, but it takes some getting use to. the city states are an interesteing complexity, not sure i like them. and the inabilty to stack armies causes some major strategy changes. over all i like it and will play it for many many hours, to my familys chagrin.",303.4

"best tbs game there is (along with xcom). way better than beyond earth. get the addons, theyre worth it. highly recommended!",208.6
"i like strategy games, i see this game is on sale for 75% off i buy it i quickly download it with all its dlcs i play settler mode first to get the hang of it i quickly befriend ghandi since hes a chill dude (im the polish btw) i also befriend korea the huns denounce me imediatly after i befriend ghandi, a spy tells me ghandi is building up an army, i disregarded it and thought he was going to attack some barbarians, i was wrong i quickly see bombers and infantry come rolling into my unprotected city since i was next to ghandi, ghandi befiended my city states before he attacked me you clever ! i thought we were friends! he quickly takes my city leaving my capital open to an air strike he takes my capital, and the remaining cities 10/10 would befriend ghandi again.",103.9

"look at my playtime. there goes so many weeks of my llife, and being brutally honest with you guys all i can say is weeks well spent. i love civ and have been appropriatley named an addict by the few friends i have, putting so much time into this game has ensured that the number of friends i have remains at a few. a great turn-based stratergy with almost no flaws, and damn it, who needs friends when you have nukes? ;) 10/10 ***** sincerely a huge civ fan, me",853.4

"civilization v hits the spot if you want turn based strategy on a global scale. best civilization game to date and still. sid meier and his team have made a must play game.",232.0
"i consider this game to be one of those game with extreme value for money its a game that i dont necessarily play every day, but once in awhile i will come back to it and play for a few hours, play something else for awhile, then come back to it its quite solid despite few mechanical issues (come on, no way to stop missionaries? ai hating you for no reasons?), but at the end of the day, very enjoyable, highly recommended for those who enjoyed civilization series",166.0
"gave gandhi some uranium and he used it to nuke me. 10/10 all jokes aside this is an amazing and addicting game that you have to play if you like strategy. you can make your own stories and tales by your choices. you can win by war or peace. if you do want to buy this game i recommend getting the expansions as they help balance and create more opportunities etc. real score: 9.5/10",51.6

"its fun and relaxing. slow-paced, almost zen-like in terms of gameplay. its a nice change from the immediacy and millisecond precision of first person shooters. as for gameplay, its mildly entertaining, with compex subsystems and multiple win conditions. combat is somewhat interesting, but mostly, its just a calming and nerve-soothing escape from reality.",136.3

"i can understand china when they speak to me 10/10 for language accuracy",22.2

"fantastic game, definitely recommend it. it has good gameplay, good graphics, good music, the only problem i have is an occasional graphics and audio bug when i play the game too long. but, its not a major disfunction, and the pros far outweigh the cons. worth every cent!",112.7
"i absolutely love civ 5. its an easy, fun, and highly addictive game. with 85 hours in, and many more planned in the future, the game does not fail to ever get boring. for strategy players, if you like strategy, this is your game, without a doubt.",102.5

"as a pretty casual gamer, i was not expecting to enjoy a game as serious as civ v starting out. however, with a couple friends to help negotiate the steep learning curve of 4x games like civ v, i was able to understand the game mechanics and enjoy it! i got caught quickly in one-more-turn syndrome, and as a result have actually gained a better appreciation of history, geography, and psychology! i recommend this game to anyone who enjoys critical thinking and has some friends to help them along.",147.2

"this game, this game... the game itself is brilliant, with so many different ways of doing things and dlc only makes it better. the civilopedia is really accurate and non-biased, the same goes with gameplay and the ai. over all this game is brilliant and i wont stop playing for a long time.",176.7
"honestly one of the best games ive ever played. definitely need to give it some time to understand it and it not always a fast game so not an ideal game for people who want a fast exciting game unless you play on the multiplayer.",76.8

"a great turn-based strategy game. this most recent development in the already loved series of nation-builders has added many a new mechanic both to multiplayer and to singleplayer. the hex grid tiles make movement much more dynamic, and the wonderfull city building mechanics bring me back to the older days of civ ii and civ iv. the only downside that i miss is the built-in worldbuilder mode that allowed me to create my own worlds. other than that, civilization v has blown me away with gameplay, the build-your-own-world and create-your-own-nation mechanics, and the great competition that your friends can provide for you in this stunning game. i highly recommend this game...",269.8

"a good but stupidly expensive rts (unless you get it on sale) game that was a little over hyped but still very fun and enjoyable if you are a fan of age of mythology, age of empires series and rise of nations series. i like this game for what it is and find myself playing it every now and then. i think there is better rts games out there but this game also has modding support and steam workshop support and that puts it above other games in contrast to replay value and gameplay. also, i find the graphics to be fitting for the type of game and simple to elaborate the beautiful environment from the distictive units. the audio is functional and supportive of what occurs in the game and seems to create a mood well.",79.7

"this is an epic stratagy game that will keep you sucked in with its epic music to go along with each civilization, and im talking like 4 hrs straight of playing.it has plenty of gameplay and also has tons of mods on the steam workshop.the dlcs for this game are also worth the money adding in serveral civilizations, senarios and houndreds of hours of gameplay. i love this game so much!",676.4

"wow...what can i say? i played the first civ when it came out, like in 91-92, i was hooked then...like i am now. fantastic gameplay, excellent tutorials (lord knows i needed them to get back into the grove with the nicely updated interface), and graphics that are just out of the this world for a turn based game of this genre. 5 stars out of 5!!!",385.1

"this game is fun and addicting i recommend setting the map type to massive to have a chaotic expirience",72.1
"i cant recommend civilization v because it didnt evolve the right way. the gameplay is decent, but could be improved a lot by listening to the community. mods, even interface ones, arent supported in multiplayer. there are a lots of bugs in multiplayer too. and finally, the artificial intelligence is terrible; or to be more precise, the tactical ai is terrible, unable to fight a war decently. there are a lots of good idea and improvements in civ v compared to civ iv, but it doesnt make it a best game. go for europa universalis iv instead.",259.6
"great game. hex tile element adds new depth to the usual square grid.though the movement controls are a litte wierd ad the character selection will jerk you all over the map once your empire is massive, it is a great strategy game derserving of a 9/10",216.4
"epic, best ever civilization game, after time optimized and really great to play. it gave me more fun than the best previous-civ - civilization ii, really this game has so much options, so many different scenarios, you can play mostly every scenario, style, build great empires on huge terrain or rush for victory in a short game. with the new expansions and dlcs, steam workshop... warning! this game neutralizes time - 1, 5, 10 hours - it passes so fast with this game! ultra playable",280.3
"worth every penny, really brings out your curiosity and....mental strive for world domination and violence.",60.6
"with different game difficulties for a range of players, various country leaders, many technological ventures, and a demand for intellect and planning ahead, civilization 5 offers a unique and addictive gameplay to todays gaming market that is sure to get new players hooked.",57.3
"very good game! enjoyed every moment! only thing that bummed me out was that gold edition doesnt include brave new world dlc. even though brave new world came out after i should still get it. other than that,great game play, good historical background , a good combat system considering its turn based. keep it up fireaxis and sid meiers!",743.7

"i knew i was ment to rule the world. {evil laugh} this is a pretty laid back, turn based game. its fun :d",74.1
"for kicking back and playing strategy world domination, this game rocks. nothing comes close to choosing your best leader based on how you like to play, then smoothly take the entire world like candy from a baby. this game rocks. eates up some cpus in the longer games, but it just cant be beat.",893.1
"dis gam so gud! u can lyk b a hella craze guy lyk mongols or evn lyk gandi who is actly dik hed! hela tite yo!",33.4

"my wife had been playing silly fb city games until i showed her civ 5. its too complicated she said, after the tutorial i cant get her out of my computer chair. i am now being forced to build her a computer for our anniversary. the game with the recent expansions is great for fans of the series and for newcomers the advisor system and tutorials allow a newcomer to dive right in.",170.1
"amazing strategy game. endless fun, play for hours. many maps and leaders to choose from. you can go up against friends or play by yourself against ai. you can win the game by 5 different victories. would definitley recommend to anybody that is looking for a good stategy game.",123.7
"good fun and taught me more about history than highschool",302.9
"hands down best game i have ever purchased on steam! all the rumors about this game being addictive are 100 % true. purchased it on an evening, ended up realizing it was early morning before i looked at the clock again. 11/10",37.5
"okay, so ive now played one full marathon game in sandbox mode. won with a domination victory, took over half of the world, and completely hunted down and offed 3 civilizations.. 40 hrs for one game. wow. after you conqour the scenario, you can then press the just..one...more...turn button, and completely obliterate the remaining civs in as many turns as you desire. pros: very long gameplay, tons of historical facts(for us people who like to learn while playing), the giant death robot. cons: no more stackable units, planes are dedicated to where it was manufactored (meaning you cant wonder around the map as a big @$$ bomber), cant break a peace treaty.. :(",84.9
"this might be the most addicting strategy game i had ever played , and i have never played a civ game before , this game is awesome !",59.2

"i started wwiii, why? why not? i was the byzantine, minding my own buisness, ruling my special island ladelu, but then portugal decided to colonize near me, on my island. so i declared war, soon after greece and indonesia joined the portuguese, but i had allies of my own. the iroquis, germany, and the morraco joined on my side. in the un i was able to illegalize nukes, but it doesnt fully disable them. but portugal and i had one. they launched theirs first at nicea, killing my 2 of my battleships. i said oh hell no! and launched mine straight to one of their cities forgot the name but killed 3 of their battleships, an aircraft carrier, and 2 xcom troops. they asked for peace next turn and got 3 of their cities without doing anything else. (even the colony). 10/10 would scare the  out of maria again.",159.2
"this is my first 4x game. it is great. just a few weeks from bought and i have quite a lot of hours into it. 9.5/10",75.7
"fun game to play, if you have the time for it. playing this game you need to make sure you have plenty of time to lose. a single game can range anywhere from 3 hours to 12 hours. its a great game where there are many avenus to victory and you have all the power to choose which one you want. definatly a game to pick up!",29.3
"starting with a city and then building your empire. with way too many hours spent on this one later (over 550 hours..) i strongly recommend it to anyone who isnt afraid of a game filled with details!",568.6
"best civ in the row. settlers dont destroy tanks, victory can be achieved in several ways.",290.1
"fantastic game, doesnt take a bunch of skill to have fun",32.5
"although i miss a few things from civ 4, its an amazing game from an amazing series. since no-ones ever made a remake of alpha centauri, this is the best 5x game.",332.9

"some glitches/bugs but overall a really fun game if you play with the right people.",66.2
"best strategy game ever made. if you love generating resources, planing strategic attacks, biulding up an empire, then this is a game for you. i recomend this game to every one who like strategy on a large scale (the game is more about generating resources than contrling units on a very small an tactic scale.",752.8
"oh hell yes! this game will consume your life, but youll love every damn second of it",141.7
"this game is awesome. i admit i have a little obsession with this one. its one of them games where you loose half the day before realize you havent eaten or even gone to the bathroom. its turn based strategy at its best. and who doesnt like to conquer the world?",504.2
"good game for people who like controling world! :d",23.7

"great game a lot of fun to play! very detailed graphics smooth game play. just good all around game.",827.4
"hands down: best civ ever! and it gets better with every expansion pack. never played civilization? then you missed out on a lot. but dont worry, just start with civ v, its awesome.",674.9
"if you can spend the time to install all the mass effect mods. have fun destroying the krogans xd",37.4
"civ 5 is a excellent contuination of an amazing rts game. although some games can feel like they go on forever, it is still an amazing game to sink your time into",159.0
"this, in my opinion, is the first civ to surpass civ 2. the first was like the first in any new type of game, something that opened everyone up, but it also had many flaws. when it came to civ 2 they found the sweet spot. upon creating the third they added way too many new things that broadened the game, but at release it too many bugs. so arguably civ 3 could have surpassed its predecessor. civ 4, like what they brought to consoles (civ revolution) was made too user friendly and didnt allow you to get deeper in strategy beyond build cities build units. civ 5, they got it all right.",91.7
"sid meiers civilization v, or civ v for short, is like the description says a turn based, stratgy game that, basically lets you control history from the beggining to the unsure future. it also has a very large amount of military units. does this game have midieval knights? yes! does this game have battleships? yes! does this game have every piece of major military weapon frome throughout history, including nukes? a massive yes! to me this is one my most prized games ever!",725.5
"you can easily get addicted to this game. it is a very well done strategy game that is great whether it is played alone or with friends.",224.0
"you really want to play it with all the dlc (with bnw in particular).",814.5
"the ultimate turn-based strategy youll ever play, with a amazing single player and a fantastic multiplayer, even more fun with friends!!!",44.7
"the civilization games are probably my favorite games period. i played civ iii, and civ iv, and i finally got civ v and at first i was a little disappointed because it was lacking some of my favorite elements from civ iv. now that ive played it some more, downloaded more civs and ordered gods and kings, its so much fun. i play it with my work friends all the time.",214.7
"absolutly beautiful version of the civ instalments. hands down my fav !",54.1
"too easy. ai is dumb. was able to win deity level on first try. on civ 4 i had a lot of difficulties on monarch and higher.",18.5
"great game to play. i can lose myself in this game for hours. just bought the brave new world expansion as well. adding more elements to the game. so many ways to win a game. ai to me doesnt seem completely stupid. fun if your looking to play against the ai, at least for me. havent played much online yet. but i am willing to bet its just as good.",35.5
"hours and hours of fun... just make sure you have hours and hours to play it. you can save at any time, but its one of those games youll intend on playing for 30 minutes, and instead staying up for 3 hours with it.",26.2
"pretty fun, good stratergy and great game when you want to zone out",40.7
"this game is an awesome strategy game. for those chess players who like to build like in games like minecraft. pros- in depth gameplay. multilple difficulties, various game modes. always expanding and you can always find a mod to build whatever world or civ you want. con- lengthy for anyone who only wants to play for short periods. some civs are imba and others stink.",623.7
"perhaps one of my all time favorite games. whether it be peacefully gliding your way to victory or crumbling everyone in your path to global domination, its always a blast!",189.4
"one does not simply play this game for less than half an hour in one sitting.",33.2
"get this game. even if youre not into strategy games, theres something youll enjoy here. its addictive. this and civ 3 are the only games ive played recently where i completely lost track of time for hours on end. theres always something for you to do, and if you somehow get bored with the base game, there are lots of mods for it that add new units, civilizations, scenarios, and even total conversions for various fictional universes, like the future mod and the middle earth mod. at $12.50, its definitely worth it.",134.7
"an amazing turn based strategy game. if you have played any of the previous civ games and havent played this one what are you waiting for?! if you havent played any civ game its easy to pick it up and learn. its fun and addicting and will continue to be enjoyable after days of playing.",24.4
"if you are a fan of the civ series then you will probably like this game.",68.3
"i have no regrets buying this game and every single dlc. worth my time and every singe dollar. although it could use some bug fixes, a ranking system and more realism no doubt one of the best games ive ever played.",598.8
"sure, it starts out slow, but once you take out an entire nation you know, you just know, that this game was made for you.",71.2
"this game was a bust at the begining. but the 2 expension make it wothwhile. for sure, everything is streamline. it minimize the micromanagement. unfortunatly, at the higher level of play the ai is not better, it just get some bonus over the player. overall a good buy when on special.",679.6
"such a fun game to play for anyone -- very rewarding.",28.8
"although i feel that this game has been a bit simplified since civilization iv, it is still a fantastic and addicting experience! at first i was disappointed with what was removed from the vanilla game (such as religion and espionage), but it was remedied with both brave new world and gods and kings. the multitude of civilizations available means that one can never run out of strategies in their quest for their nation to stand the test of time!",301.2
"kill your friends. kill your enemies. but most importantly, kill time. seriously, this game makes plane rides go by like theyre nothing.",216.4
"civilization 5 is yet another masterpiece to add to sid meiers legacy. it has nailed down everything from engaging graphics and gameplay to witty little historical tidbits you pick up about given civilizations. i like the simplification of some systems like cultural land aquisition while the complexity of others like religion, trade routes, and tourism. overall, civ 5 gets a 10/10 from me.",323.9
"this is my favorite game in the world. it will consume your life and youll play it instead of living your life. which is fine because you dont have anything going on anyway.",355.1
"it took me a long time from buying and downloading civilization v to actually playing it. theres a reason behind it, which is i never liked turn-based games. it took me a long time to actually give this game a try, and boy do i regret that it took me so long. without a shadow of doubt, civilization v is among the best games i have ever played. i absolutely love it.",813.9
"this game is good to play with friends and be horrible to them at the same time",83.4
"amazing game! definetly buy if you can, and every dlc they are all awesome. i think that civilization v + dlcs is better then the new civilization: beyond earth, and if the dlcs wont do it, try mods! als epic.",654.4

"one does not simply play this game for just 30 minutes",203.3
"love it. just love it. so in depth. i played this game in a free trial when beyond earth came out, and i couldnt stop playing it. i now have to wait until christmas before the next big sale until i will get the game, and i am dying. i might not survive... if you have the money, get it.",69.5
"pretty good game! no formal tutorial. an rts game that focuses more on economy and less on warfare",158.5
"civilization 5 is a great game, it will have you saying just one more turn every turn you want to stop playing, one of the best stategy games that i have ever played. a very immersive game, that i highly reccomend to any strategy game fan.",36.9
"apart from skyrim, this game is one of the top 3 reasons i got into pc gaming. i love everything about it and feel like it could never get old. as much time as i have put into it, i feel like i have only skimmed the surface of what i believe is one of the best games ever made. one more turn will be a though that crosses your mind constantly and on into the hours of the morning. if youre into strategy, get this game immediately. my only complaint is the loading times, but that is my only complaint.",164.1
"this game is yet another golden egg given to us by sid meier. his skill at crafting these beautiful games is unmatched. i recomend this game to anyone who loves strategy or any casual gamer.",40.5
"fantastic game, only gripe with it is the ammount of time you can lose in one setting to it",75.6
"dropping nukes and atomic bombs as gandhi is deeply satisfying",41.3
"i love this game and if you think about buying it you should because it is fun and that you can play some many people it to a game worth getting.",42.3
"this game, along with both the expansion packs, is as close to perfect as you can get. nuff said.",294.7
"they all fall for one of the most classic of blunders! never get involved in a land war in asia!",179.8
"its an extremely fun and addictive game that gets really into the gameplay as well as the ability to play as one of the great leaders youve heard or read about also makes it one of the top notch games there have been",36.1
"with all the dlc and amazing care taken to make this game the masterpeice it currently is has paid off. this is a must play for any fan of strategy games.",487.1
"great game, played over 600 hours and have had it for a year.",611.2
"is awsome i have played 223.6 hours and is still fun",267.4

"very absorbing. one game could mean a whole day wasted on this game",171.6
"napoleon and i became friends, then ghandi gave napoleon uranium.we never spoke again 10/10",55.6
"must have for everyone who likes turn-based strategy games. it demands stronger hardware, especially in later stages of game when there are many civilisations left and most of map is opened.",765.3
"this is probably the best strategy game ive ever played hands down. so many ways to win but my favorite has to be attila the huns. he is designed to erase the first guy you meet off the map. op.",122.8
"great 4x timesink. easy to get into with plenty of depth for when you get better. so-so multiplayer, as with all civilization titles. ai can be lacking but its competent on higher difficulties with bonuses. both expansions are totally worth it.",673.1
"if you are a fan of 4x games this one is a must. like: every map gives a new experiance, combinded with each unique civ everygame feels like a new experiance. everything is really fluent and plenty of ways to win (conquest,space, etc...) great ui good muliplayer game to play. dislike: the ai can be a pain when trying to make deals, as they will either wont trade or screw you. multiplayer servers are a pain as they will randomly disconect or refuse to connect to friends you are playing with. to get the whole experiance you need all the expac",140.8
"+youll be telling yourself just a couple more turns and im done +...save yourself",92.3
"very fun game, it is very easy to set up a game for multiplayer and singleplayer. i would recomend this for everyone.",258.9
"10/10 would play more if my computer could run it. recommend it if you have a better pc than me.",56.6
"always a good time, i go back to it for a civ binge at least once or twice a year.",142.8
"ah, the most addicting game ive got... guaranteed to either bore the hell out of you... or make you waste tons of hours of your social life... win win? well, give it a test-drive! only 30 bucks (quite cheap).",180.1
"this is a great game in almost every aspect. the premise is that you are the king of a city (which you may choose). you build buildings, train armies, take over cities... but there are so many approaches. you can win the game with science. or by going from men on horses to nuking gandhi. 10/10",68.8
"civilization v is great for those who are not great at strategy games, particularly ones focusing on military might. i have never been very good at keeping an organized military force, whether it be in the turn based or real time genres, but this game does a great job of giving you alternate paths to victory. though i am aware previous iterations of civ have always had multiple paths to victory, this version has made achieving those victories viable.",76.6
"life cannot exist without death, and possible world war iii scenarios could not exist without civ v.",83.5
"one of my favourite games of all time. the content in the vanilla game is huge but pair that with g&k and bnw expansions and the game has the most content i think i have ever seen.",158.6
"okay this game is still by far my number 1 recommendation. everytime i play it i have a new experience. i mean really a game that has unlimted possibltys. i mean spelling aside, this game is wwhat i would recommend for anyone who is intrested in this style. pros- amazing -fun to solo -fun to duel -amazing scenarios -ai isnt a push over on normal(prince) and diety is super challenge mode it can be said this game has covered all the bases cons- if someone dcs in the game it blows",195.5
"woah! what is this? a strategy game? hell yea, its a damn strategy game. and thats a strat-a-gey! in this game, you need to think up a plan right from the start, and stick with it! well, try to anyways, but the instant you find gandhi, elizabeth, or even george washinton, you may find yourself going from a peacemaker to a warmonger, or vice-versa, or maybe youll just stay as the guy who stays in the corner of the world doing nothing other than having one company endlessly make games for the rest of the world, but yknow, whatever. this game is definately worth the time wasted. #tenouttaten. well, more like 9.99999/10, but this isnt math class.",183.7
"this strategy game is the best i have ever played.",112.2
"probably the best game ever (i mean the civ franchise) :) high replayability ratio.",495.6
"a great addition to the series, with a lot of fun features and pretty visuals.",378.1
"fun game, spent many hours playing. however be warned, i found i had the most fun near the beggining of the game exploring the area and meeting other people, but near the middle to end half it feels extreamly repedative as you are stuck in an endless routine of upgrading buildings but hardly doing anything ells, and when you do have the forces to bulldoze everyone your forced to take what feels like years to get your troups from one end of the map to the other (oh the feels if you need to call upon reinforcements). thus having a large army is a huge burden as you have to micromanage everything. love the game though as i rage against gahndis lack of morality, but i feel taken advantaged of do to there being so many dlcs that it feels like the basic game is only half finished. ill give it a 7/10 but if there werent so many dlcs id give it a 8.5/10",179.7

"cant go wrong with a civ game, howver get the expansions, this goes for any civ game. like every title before, the vanilla base game feels lacking.",15.1
"best game i have ever played. soundtrack is the greatest thing ever. although not enough can be said about the vanilla game, the dlcs and modding community add almost too much replay value!",184.4
"i very recomend gaem becuz is very god nd i play wit friendds nd i get 2 reserch books but den ppl kil me nd they r meen.",53.1
"amazing game, civ 5 does not fail to live up to its well-established name. my only complaint is they need to fix the multiplayer bug! it renders the game unplayable at times.",15.6
"yup buy it and then rule the world and raze stuff :)",94.7
"great game if you like strategy and wars games. you dont need to like turn-based games to like this one.",105.4
"that awkward moment when you remember you have a pet after a three day binge play. . .",213.2
"man , this game just awesome :d yes its true , i have play hundred hour non-steam",35.8
"good base game although it is worth purchasing brave new world expansion pack as it adds very well on to the gameplay or as part of the complete edition which at 39.99 is the same as buying the base game and brave new world although it is a much better deal.",25.5
"i dislike civ5 for the same reason i dislike games like risk. once the status quo is established theres really no turning it around. it rewards winners, and punishes everybody else just for playing. also it doesnt spend long enough in any era but the modern one. see: crusader kings ii for an entertaining grand strategy game.",439.9
"civ 5 has a moderately steep learning curve, but once you learn the basics, this game will entertain and challenge you like none other. biggest downside is that the ai cant really handle itself in military conflicts against a human.",997.7
"im not one for long reviews, so heres the simple review: vanilla civ 5: 6.5/10 has the potential, but doesnt perform. ai makes questionable moves is the primary thing, as well as no religion. civ 5 with either the gods and kings dlc, brave new world dlc or both: 9.8/10 with either one of the expansions, one of the greatest turn based strategy games ever made. adds new buildings, wonders, civs, religion, balancing, tweaking and ai putting up a challenge. just superb.",94.1
"its pretty good...starts to get boring after about 100 hours, but with the brave new world expansion its very fun.",95.3
"one of the best civ games out there so pumped they mave beyond earth",148.3
"a very fun and strategic game where you lead your armies and into battle or have allies to boost your economy, the way you play effects the entire game, not the civilizations bonus.",894.2
"civilization v is one of the very best strategic games on the market in terms of military activity, politics, culture, science, and economy. once you get attached to this game, itll provide hours and hours of fun and strategy. i recommend this game to any gamer who wants to build a nation, create alternate history, or simply conquer the world.",149.1
"have only played in local co-op and have enjoyed that, will probably make further comments as i play in sp. have satellite for internet so that does limit my games that i can play.",43.1
"epic, the dlcs turn the game into a brand new one..... as good if not better than civ 4",199.0
"a classic game model and one that sid meier is king, i felt this game returned a bit of the magic that was lost in iv not yet tried the multiplayer but looking forward to giving it a try soon. its another one of those games to keep you up until the early hours with that just one more turn mindset. i especially enjoy the fast paced early years in game over the modern era but its fun to just overpower your enemies end game",72.6
"the best and most amazing game that you have ever played in my entire lyfe. buy this game at all costs but try to wait for a sale cause, $30 bucks hell no not saying its not worth it... it is just im a cheap basterd",51.5

"great game. fun for more than 100 hours. highly recommend getting brave new world expansion for added replay value, gameplay, and ui experience. 10/10!",57.7
"pros: endless replayability so many countries you can play as amazing visuals workshop content cons: slow (not a bad thing for some people) starting the game takes so long ghandi.... ai constantly backstab you to the point where alliances are usually not worth it overall this is a great game, and i highly recommend this game to any turn based strategy lovers.",92.4

"very addictive, reminds of old school fun that age of empires brought me as a kid. if it was possible to play through an entire session with an army of friends it could possibly be the best game ever made. even the shortest play through will take you probably 5-15 hours.",179.0
"i think....i love this game. diplomatic options were sorely limited and happiness was a thing that i though needed a ton of work but, over all it is an awesome incarnation of the series. it is incredibly difficult to please me as im always wanting more so take my opinion for what it is....",742.2

"my sleep cycle has never been the same after a good dose of civ v. multiplayer is a bit heavy to play with constant lag issues.",136.5

"this game is really fun ecspecially with all the different options you can change, although the brave new world dlc drastically improves it (highly recommend bnw dlc). be warned though unless you play with very few other players or on fast difficulty only than this game will burn through all of your daylight hours, but maybe you want that to happen?",373.2
"in-depth turn based strategy and empire-building at its best!",707.0

"civilization v is the fifth installment in arguably the best stratgy series ever. though people argue that its prdecessor, civ 4, was much better. but is it really. so in civ 5 you essentially pick an emeror ie; napolean and build a civilization. people say that civ 4 was better, because there were much more elements. yes, in civ 5 they did take a lot of eleents that civ 4 had, but if you are willing to get the dlc brave new world, you may get that civ experience that you were wanting all along with better graphics. you should definnitely pick this game up if you havent, you can get it really cheap of amazon or in the steam sales, in my opinion this is one of the best strategies out there today.",71.6

"as a hardcore civ 4 fan, it took me a long time to accept the changes made in civ 5. some micromanagement is (somewhat sadly) gone, but it makes the game a little more strategic (which ill admit is nice). i also now like the one-unit-per-tile combat model. id definitely pick up all the expansion packs, they very much fill out the mid and late game - which was a little flat in civ 5 1.0.",126.1

"as a fan of the entire civilization franchise, civ v ranks up there as one of, if not the very best. many functionalities have been streamlined while most core elements remained, providing a true civ experience, with rich depth that was almost lacking in pervious iterations. brave new world expo is a must, as it adds the perfect amount of customization and choice to the player for it to be one of the best 4x games out there. loved the game and would reccomend it to anyone.",313.9
"probably one of my favorites of the civilization series in general. ive played every one since civ ii - and this one is certainly at the top of the list. as easy or as hard as you want it to be, so many options exist that you have an almost infinite amount of replay potential. the only bad thing i have to say about it is that the ai for worker automation is rather poor. once your civilization has a ton of workers, it gets confused and theyll just sit on the same tile changing out the building there over and over. beyond some little kinks like that, one of the best.",386.6
"i think this game is really fun and really good. ive rushing like non-stop and its really addicting, my advise is buy all the dlcs like the brave new world dlcs its just amazing. btw this game is extremely easy to pick up for someone who never play turn base strategy games. hope u enjoyed it as much as i do",54.1
"one of my favorite games of all time and compared to the newest one, which is about space(forget the title) it is by far better. it will seem old and dated graphics wise but, the concepts are wonderful and i could play this game endlessly. i used to play it on my laptop(not my gaming pc) and was forced to quit whenever turn 100 got around because my computer would crash. litterly 400 hours of life gone on civ and i didnt even play with people. great game but, it is amazing if you have friends to play with(which can last awhile, dont have any plans)",40.7

"f*ck this game is beautiful. sure it looks like another strat but the amount of detail brought into the games is mind blowing. the dlc is just as immense, it adds pure and fresh interesting maps for example the earth map that is geologically accurate to the one your standing on. new leaders that you can use to your advantage. plus ghandi (no joke) is your enemy from day one. he will be friendly as stated in real life but theres a bug in his programming that makes him the destroyer of worlds. be very careful with him. five turns at ghandis rate: 10/10",28.2

"by far the best of the civ games so far in my opinion, and the first one ive really liked since civ ii (not that i disliked civ iv, just...not this much). the ai is better, the resources are much better-implemented than ever before, as is the map generator, and the overall gameplay experience is smoother and better. gods and kings and brave new world substantially improve the gameplay, and are also worth picking up.",905.2

"i cant explain it. you open the game...and then you look at the clock and youve somehow lost track of the last 6 hours. any game that can engross you that much is a definite recommendation! a definite must-have for any 4x strategy game fan!!",13.7
"i love this game. i only have one problem is that i bought gold edition but do not have the gold edition dlc so thats my only down side. other than that great game, couldnt recommend it enough.",79.6
"extremely well made turnbased strategy game, easy to play and fun. very timeconsuming.",228.4
"this game is great for when you just want to take it slow. trade, conquer, or just be completely peaceful, this is one of my favorites!",129.3
"pretty damn good, and this is coming from a guy that doesnt like strategy games",26.3
"bloody brilliant. the mods make this game even better, theres nothing quite like playing as the soviet union and crushing the us after a 3000 year cold war.",120.7
"favorite game in my library. super easy to pick up and learn and before long youll be playing for hours on end. endless possibilities in map and leader combinations, so each and every game you play will be different. highly recommend this game, even if have never played a turn-based strategy game, this was my first one and i love it.",698.4
"an excellent game on all accounts. if you love strategy, or if you want to remake history, this is the game for you.",339.9
"how much more fun can a strategy game get? none! i say when playing this",41.5
"great game, civ 5 + gods & kings can be got fairl cheaply. just wait for the 20 brave new world to come down.",103.9
"has been said thousands of times before but this is a great and immersive game. i got back into it by stumbling across the solar gamers youtube channel and his excellent civ 5 play throughs.",22.7
"civilization v will be in my top 10 games of all time. i was hooked on this game within the first few turns that i took, easily losing nights to this game. espically with the great modding community, this game can be adjusted to anybodys liking, and would strongly recommend to those who enjoy strategy games and history, as i, am a history nerd and a strategy lover. watch your own civilization grow from one city, to the whole world, either by force or peaceful means, there are many decisions to be made when you play this game, and can be replayed over and over again.",590.4
"great game, but a little laggy at times with my crappy computer. you sit down and start playing at 7:00, thinking youll play for a half hour or so before starting your 4 page lit essay. and then it hits you at 11:00 that you havent started on your essay at all and you are basically screwed. this game has caused more lost nights of sleep than any other. get if you want to lose your life (or if you have none).",100.4
"this game takes thought to win if you know what you are doing it can set up your cards and win",91.8
"i can never ask for stuff, but my friends could do it. how long have i been in-game? i never knew germany built the great wall i never knew china built the pyramids i never knew gandhi loved nuking people my life is a lie 10/10",225.8
"civ has always been a game i go to when i want to think, but not be hurried. i enjoy having decisions being made without the pressure of ongoing attacks. fun game that i continue to invest in.",393.3
"how too get a civilization build an do not let any other plantason take it away from you.",44.6
"if you fancy a good cry, this is the game for you. 10/10 will cry again",87.2
"every single detail in this game is beatifull i really love future warfare. this game can be used as. either a fine game where you build your city or. a worldwide strategical warfare. example:farming simulator 2015 + company of heroes 2 =civ v just enjoy the game. also the funny thing i found in this game that is destroyed enemy capital by just nuking it with 20 guided missles and finishing with apc",52.0
"graphics are great, gameplay is lacking. no unit stacking on planet-size scale might have been a neccesary change but it feels like panzer general, not civilization. civilization 4 would leave you with a sensation of building a nation from stone ages, this one is more about wrestling in a sandbox. both activities might be fun, just make your pick.",29.4
"one of my favourite game series, civv actually acomplishes what most of the series put out in terms of building an empire. there are numerous ways to win, and a few ways to survive. one of my favourite is just winning from the science method, while trying to get all countries to be peaceful is a pain, at least you can always backup your defense with science.",121.4
"civilization v had a lot of issues when it first launched, which resulted in that i dropped out of the game, because it wasnt any fun compared to the predecessor. when i picked up the game after it was on sale and my friend asked me if it was worth it, i immediately saw a lot of improvements. id reccomend this game if youre prepared to get the major dlcs (gods and kings and brave new world). the rest of the dlcs are just for fun :)",77.7
"finallz after the brave new world expansion civ v really shines, i was initiallz disappointed when civ v first came out as it lacked many features that were present in civ iv with its expansions. with gods & kings and brawe new world the game is at last what is should have been then. a rethought and upgraded civ iv with some new features not present in the previous installement. a great game, too bad we needed to wait 3 years for it to be upgraded to be just that.",713.7
"it would probably take less time to build an actual civilization than finish one game here.",77.6
"if you like strategy, empire building, world revolutionizing fun, this is a great game for you. unfortunately the game is little lackluster in the base game, but dont get me wrong it is very fun. however, adding the two major dlcs (possibly some of the best dlcs to a game) make it incredibly fun. religion, politics, and so much more! as you can see, i have nearly 200 logged onto the game so that should hopefully give a bit of insight if youre planning to purchase it. i wholeheartedly recommend the two major dlcs. over all i love this game and the whole franchise.",291.8
"buy at least gods and kings (preferably from gold edition), and you already have amazing time-sinking game. find some buddies for multiplayer => best game for long winter nights.",100.6
"at first, i wasnt interested at playing a kind of strategic games. but after playing this, my whole opinion turned 180 degrees. civilization v is a great turn-based strategy game. sorry, i mean the best out there. civ v is just like a combination of chess but your opponent is more than one and you may win by diplomatic strategies. it makes your brain works hard to think about strategies for confronting other nations, and this is the only game that makes me insomniac. just...one...more...turn!",26.0
"simply amazing piece of gaming entertainment. many hours of fun to be had with this one folks. no two games are the same, which is what makes it so good.",131.5
"fun game. massive skill ceiling. gameplay gets old after a while, but fun while it lasts. great multiplayer with friends.",138.5
"oh my snick-snack patty-whack give this game a bone! this is one of the greatest turn-based strategy games out there, please give this game a chance because it it absolutely astonishing!",240.3
"wow. ive played this for, like, 50 hours, but only actually opened the game 7 times. wow.",55.5
"very positive feeling, playing this game. not only you have different fractions, which are worth to play through by themselves, but also randomised sets of rules, makes it worth playing for months! nice graphics, for every video card!",35.1
"the ultimate 4x game. its the most polished 4x game around, anyone who is interested in the genre should get it. it might not end up being your favourite, but you will get a lot of joy from this wonderful game regardless. just make sure to get the dlc.",151.9
"a great game... provides hours upon hours of gameplay. keeps you interested with random maps, opponents and many ways to win the game. it allows every player to adapt to their play style and if they get bored with it to try a different way to win.",115.4
"best strategy game ever. this game is beautiful, it is amazing. why is it so good? because, the detail is amazing, plus the maps you play on are amazing, each civilization has it own unique benefit. if anybody is think about buying it, it is worth your money. one of the best games ive ever played",109.8
"there is not enough words to describe how amazingly fun this game is and i have yet to meet someone who doesnt enjoy playing the game :) there are a variety of courses you can choose to go whether you choose to destroy everyone in your path or possibly be a diplomatic leader who strives in culture. the game is extremely fun when you play with your friends and like monopoly it seems to take forever to actually finish. you dont have to play with friends, but it certainly can bring a new edge to the game unlike playing against npcs. in conclusion, if you are looking for a long lasting enjoyable game that you can play by yourself or with friends, then look no further ^_^",64.8
"sid meier is to stategy games as george lucas is to star wars. the most comprehensive and easy to use turned based strategy game to date.",225.1
"excellent game, a few minor mechanic bugs but all in all a solid game to compliment the series. cant wait to see the next installment.",70.5
"i want this game so mush. one of the best games i have ever played but dont have the money for can some one gift it to me :) :(",59.6
"it took only one time through the civ 5 game to appreciate it. now, its my favorite civ game (and i started with civ 1).",752.1
"brilliant game if you can pick up both expansions and all dlc in one go. if you cant the vanilla game is good and all, but lacks alot of (whats the word) finish, both the expansions eventually bring it. a few draw backs for myself are, the one unit to a hex (i enjoyed civ 4 alot before this), this can make huge armies rathe unmanageable. i feel like there isnt enough tech, would love for it to go on further, into future techs in beyond earth in some way. some of the great things with this game is it has a huge modding community, massive multiplayer base, and the devs are still looking after the game.",215.0
"you can probably find the complete edition of this cheaper from serial key websites so check these sites before buying here. in terms of turn-based strategy, it really doesnt get much better than this. people have often voiced complaints that this is a watered down version compared to civilization iv. with the complete edition, this is not the case. just get it.",114.4
"this is a great addition to the civilization series",2.0
"this is one of my favorite games of all time. even though i am good at these type of games, i still think everyone would enjoy this game.",346.4
"a lot of good changes in this game. square tiles to hexes, ai seems to be better, one unit per tile, units being a little more valuable, etc. grab it when its on sale, though, much like how you should be getting every other steam game.",95.3
"great game, but 2k offers absoultely no support. i bought bnw and it broke my game. i can no longer play without memory leaks (only program on my comp that does this). i feel ripped off because the only person who made any progress in helping me fix this ing game was my cousin.  you 2k, im not buying any more of your games because your support staff are . when i ask a question i dont need a copy and pasted response. then when i answer that  response, you have the ing nerve to copy and paste another response. treat me with respect. im a ing customer that used to support you.",233.5
"civilization v, especially with both dlcs installed, is the best civilization game to date and no matter how many times i play it, i still keep comming back to it and it never gets old! i very much recommend this game!",691.6
"very great game to play offline and with freinds, prefect for sitting back and relaxing.",134.3
"been a fan of the series since civ iii with conquerors expansion and love civ 5 more.",9.7
"this is actually the first strategy game ive every played and so far, im quite impressed. it peaks your interest and keeps you entertained for hours. it allows you to play in single player and in multi-player mode. highly recommended and thus far in my opinion is one of the best turned-based strategy games out there.",189.3
"great game, before you know it, youve spent 10 hours on it, late for school...",62.2
"remember how gandhi was a kind, non-nuking, peaceful, loving leader? me neither. dont believe his lies.",84.2
"its good ole civilization....but now with hexagons!!!!",499.0
"i got this for a free steam weekend and i was hooked and i didnt want to get off. its just so awesome cause you get to make your own country/empire and you can make peace with other empires or go to war or trade with them and you can build roads its so fun. this will defintly get you hooked on it for hour and hours of playing it. 10/10",3.4
"def the best civ game so far. worth getting the expansion too.",182.9
"civilization v is a masterpiece (as long as you have all the dlc that is), its one of the few games that actually deserves every penny of its price and more, so make sure you buy all the dlc too, to show the developers the love and respect that they deserve for making this game. this game is definitely on my top 10 greatest games of all time. score: 10/10.",175.5
"very fun if you think you would enjoy creating and maintaing a country from the beginnings of time to the future era. there is nothing like being the last country standing in a massive scenario where you make the history... you play as historically correct civilizations from the past and even though it is a turn based type strategy game all players are pretty much taking their turn at the same time... this makes for a real time effect and can make the game seem way more interesting...",331.4
"i love playing civ 5. you can spend hours on this game building your civilisations and making stories for them as well as your neigbours. i like how you play and i like how you can be anyone really... the mods make the game even better and i applaud the mod makers on steam who continue to surprise me with what they come up with. apart from a few crashes every now and then and the sometimes grindingly slow gameplay in later stages of games, i throuroughly enjoy this game and recommend it fro anyone who enjoys building,strategy and/or roleplaying games.",222.8
"the most addictive game i have ever played. 100% would recommend, but clear your schedule.",96.7
"this game is so addictive. whenever i think 1 hour has passed, i realise that its actually 3. pro: the tone of the game the atmosphere depending on your civilisation, the many cultural music that randomly play the interactions the units different animation depending on the order you gave them and more. this a wondeful game. con: more interaction choices with the different leaders would be nice. >>> i was friend with the russia leader catherine until i had to attack a citie she was friend with (they were in my way). since then i had no way whatsoever to be friend with her again and she kept on denouncing me and being aggressive.",248.7
"beged gandhi for peace, he dropped a nuke on me. 10/10",69.4
"i have no doubts that this is the best tbs out there. very addictive, has plenty of replay ability, and gives you something fun to do on those boring, rainy days. and if your not a fan of buying dlcs, or just dont like the dlc for this game in general, you could always get community created in-game civilizations and mods for free. my only complaint is the bug which occurs sometimes when you get late into a game, that causes the whole thing to crash. as long as you save every 5-10 turns near the end of the game, you should be good :) 9/10",684.0
"if youre into turn-based strategy. if youre into building up the perfect setup. if youre into amassing massive armies, or perhaps just raising a small town into a glorious empire, you should get this game. it is addicting. you will always ask for one more turn. i guarantee it.",48.8
"if you enjoy turn based startegy games, this is your game. i bought the complete pack with all the dlc except the new one, for about $13. its worth your money even at full price. just be careful to pay attention to the time unless you want to accidently pull an all nighter on this game. 9/10 - experienced graphics issues later game and when loading up a game, otherwise great.",481.6
"its a turn-based 4x game! what?! i though all 4x games were time-based, like age of empires... this changes everything for me!",29.1
"this series has always been a major upside to my gamer life. i love a challenge, and i love games that take me a long time to 100%. civilization has always fufilled both of those requests for me, and it just keeps getting better. civ v is no exception.",48.2
"this game is godlike. it is beautiful and wonderful. even the vanilla version makes oyu want to just stay for 12 hours and play. i highly recommending waiting for a sale for the complete version but i still got bnw and it is awesome. love the game and its mods make it more exciting. 5 out of 5. a perfect game.",383.5
"played a trial version, its really great. ive seen it with the dlc included and that looks a lot better though.",80.1
"a great strategy game. a must have for fans of the genre.",77.8
"this game is so deep and complex but is made so even beginners can play no problem. 9/10",24.8
"one of the best turn base games and empire building games",42.7
"always a good experience and is only made better during multiplayer.",255.9
"awesome game. warning! this game will cause loss of track of time , also extream fun and addivtive!",60.5
"if youre getting this, make sure to pick up brave new world. the gods and kings expansion has basically been worked into it (with a ton more content). the extra civs you can live without, but make sure to pick up some form of expanded game. the base game is a bit flat.",222.0
"great game! very addictive. i have logged around 350 hours so far.",426.1
"its a war strategy game that has a lot of customability. the game hardly decides anything for you and you control every factor. you dont even have to win by war you can win by culture, science, and even be elected world leader. watch a couple videos atleast. :)",498.2
"fun to play with friends even if they take an hour on their turns.",88.9
"if you havent go this game already buy it because your missing out on 100s of hours of fun amazing. although definatly get the dlc as it adds so much",232.4
"sometimes i pretend that the cities i build are full of my children and their grandchildren and that im the best dad in the world, but when my units die i get really sad because i dont want to outlive any of my kids. when i lost a scout, that i named steven, i cried for hours and then had to call all of my real children to make sure that they were okay. they were fine, but it really was an eye opening experience because you never know when you will loose your loved ones, and any game that can create such an amazing educational experience such as this should get a medal. do they give medals to video games? anywas, i reccomend this game to children who disrespect their parents, because it could show them what it is like to be a parent. i will never play this game again, though, because it is too sad for me.",190.4
"its an amazing strategy game that really gets you hook into it if you just spend 10 minutes playing it. it reminds me a lot of age of empires 2 back in the days when i first played it.",226.7
"not too deep, not too shallow. easy to learn and play but can be challenging. civ v is definitely one of the best 4x game. a must have. one more turn!",77.7
"really awesome and solid game. if you love strategy, get this game.",295.4
"this game is an awesome constant time sink and one of my favorite games that i have played. many nights have been spent fighting friends over and over!",171.0
"a good game overall with improved combat versus civ3 and civ4. however, it is slower loading than civ4 and there are still graphical and logic glitches. continuous updates of civ5 has eliminated the ingame mod browser and negated compatibility of old mods with todays version, forcing the player to buy the dlcs to access previously free content. there are more technologies compared to the previous civs, but unlike galactic civilizations, there is still little change to the endgame (where your only option after exhausting your research is to go full war) or how you wish to steer your empire.",510.5
"civilization v is my favorite game currently. a game i can get lost in for hours and find very elegent. it gives you a god complex. i feel as if its a game about secert society using there puppets nations to really rule the world.",620.9
"the most epic game ever made... yeah. its that good.",767.2
"great game,havent found an error yet(and hope it continues that way), just perfect",348.5
"what happened to my day? i spent how much time playing? fml. worth every penny.",37.8
"this is one of my all time favorite games. ive been playing since the very first civ on an old radioshack tandy computer.",50.5
"the game is a dream, what else to say. it is a pity that in addition to the presence of pain in the  of the enemy, and the fact of robbery hunting traders little useful.  of",5.4
"this game is great for strategists. youll sink in hours and hours of time into this game and will never be bored. just one more turn, one more turn. thatll be the chant you repeat everytime you make a move.",56.4
"they declared war on me because i tresspassed their borders once some millenias ago. good times. surely recommend. 10/10 would play again.",143.2
"using mods, i can have big boss as a jedi conquering the world using culture whilst up against blasto the hanar, hatsune miku, cthulu and canada. best game",60.5
"good game, but many things were either downsized or made worse from civ 4",46.2
"brilliant game!!! but be carefull you pay attention to your time played!",112.6
"hello! i have done a few stupid reviews however i am going to do a real review so lets begin. so civilization v has many dlc packs however people will rush straight into brave new world but dont its a great dlc pack however you will miss alot that civilization v offers to begin with, i see many people only getting this to download modded players like winston curchill: with the united kingdom of great britian and northern irelan, or lenin with whatever the ussr stands for (sorry my patriotism is showing xd). but lets be honest you are missing out on alot of content which in evry enjoyable! so civilization v by itself is 8/10 but with brave new world is 10/10 for me!",74.6
"freaking awesome game, tons of ways to win and many avenues of approaches!",47.1
"a classic, cant go wrong with this. i just wish more people played it. sure, the graphics arent the greatest. it is however fun. very versatile in game play and style. build up armies, make treaties, beat people down, build em up,  em off and then be at war with the world. its great, fun, learn cultures, and history all at the same time while having fun. what more could ya ask for ?",239.1
"took one look at the artwork/graphics and said nah. and that was that for a long time. i eventually gave in to all the hype when it was on sale and omfg, its only like the best grand strategy ive ever played! entire days have been happily lost since.",91.1
"civ was one of the first games i ever played and to this day each new addition has been a staple in my life ^_^",33.2
"while this game has been given high scores from professional game reviewers it has also been given bad marks by some longtime civilization players. i dont think these naysayers are necessarily in the majority though. personally the game is pretty good. it is not as good as civilization ivs beyond the sword expansion but i do like it a lot. 1upt (one unit per tile) is a refreshing change that will only get better with further expansions. build choices matter more than ever now because you have to balance happiness, culture, expansion, defense, & conquest all through gold or buildings. it is no longer as simple as adjusting a slider.",883.2
"if you have any respect for your free time, do not buy this. it has a small tendency to suck you in (in a good way). you play for hours in what seemed like minutes. also, got denouced for being a warmonger by atilla the hun. 10/10",62.9
"great to play with friends and it can fly. much better than civ iii, so happy birthday!",109.2
"civ 5s logic. what?!?! you rejected my friends friend request for a trade agreement that was completely not in your favor?!?! how dare you! you dugust me you foul warmonger! prepare for war!!! uhhhh, why did you just claim a tile thats 20 tiles away from my civilization??? are you trying to acttack me?!?! warmonger! how dare you kill one of mongolias units after they nuked you! we happen to be friends you know!!!! how dare you vote against my proposal to embargo you! denoucement!!! 10/10",530.1
"great game, a just one more turn feel to it. i have been playing it since the first version and i still completely love it. i have been recommending it to the people i work with.",70.1
"i recommend this it is a very fun and exciting strategy game with lots to think about while in-game.",2.2
"very addictive game! the (expensive) gods & kings dlc is a must buy though.",387.7
"addictive, beautifully desingned, polished gui. expect to lose several hours of your life playing it, its worthy of that.",323.9
"i recommend this game alot. if you play it multiplayer it might be a bit laggy, but it still works. its a really good game where you can challenge the ai in a stragetic game with no possible way of nothing how theyll react.",118.9
"beautiful and intrigiung game. highly recomend for all audiences.",40.4
"this game is one of the best games in my steam library, if i start a game ill probably play for about 9 hours with no breaks (besides the lue) and my friends and i love the  outta this game xd i would definately buy it again if anything happened to it 1010 my favorite game ;)",101.6
"its civ... what more can be said. by far the best of the series. have enjoyed many an hour playing it and without any bug, crashes, or other anomolies that would detract from enjoyment. i look forward to civilization vi when ever that gets developed and released. highly recommend.",846.6
"this is one of the best rts games available right now!",45.1
"excellent game! i cannot stress how amazing this game is for anyone that loves strategy games.",47.2
"no turn-base strategy games are better made made than the sid meiers civilization 5. i love that game.",324.5
"i reallly enjoy this game because its complicated many ways to win, and you always have fun even when your new so i think you should play it",74.3
"i loved it however this is simply my kind of game. the game practically plays itself considering its turn based you only have a few decisions to make then its up to the computer. so it probably will be boring at times.",454.4
"great game, very addictive. the game was good but the dlcs make it worth while with both gods and kings and brave new world. so much to do and so many ways to win!",166.3
"i have spend 200+ hours playing sid meiers civilization 5. it has got to be one of my most favorite games i have ever played. it has wonderful ways to play how you want to play and still have a fun time doing it.",307.5
"very fun and worth the money if you can get it on sale. the combat is much more enjoyable than civ 4 (no more making huge stacks of units on one tile and rolling around the map... no more 500 year sieges on cities with 30 units stacked in them). i like how the terrain matters much more for both combat and empire infastructure planning (no more having a road to every tile unless you want to be bankrupt). embarking is a nice feature which means you dont have to wait for transport boats to go to sea... other than that its basically just another civ game. entertaining but not head of the pack by any means.",183.6
"proposal to congress to repeal the embargo against the ottoman empire. request from the ottoman empire for silver in exchage for 4 votes for the proposal at the congress.",159.2
"amazing game love it just wish i had more people to play it with.",289.3
"this is an amazing strategy game for both hardcore and not so hardcore players. it can relly take you hours if you are building you dream-emprie so i warn you. for civilization fans=buy for turn-based fans=buy for people thinking about buying=buy for people who can only play 20 min a day=sadly dont buy it can be played in shoter burst but i still prefer playing for atleast the 40-45 min. at a time.",101.5
"excellent game if you are into macro style strategy games. the graphics are pretty good and run well on lower end computers. its unfortunate at higehr difficulties the a.i. gets unfair advantages to compensate for poor coding.",88.1
"i think civilization v is verygood apart from the fact that you can build wonders if someone alredy built them",12.9
"too epic to stand not buying. you must buy this. also, you must buy the brave new world expansion. dont get gods and kings. bnw basically has the exact same stuff but better as g&k. buy now!",356.2
"oh god, i could play this forever...between the vanilla game, expansions, and the terrific modding community, you can find anything you want within. buy and enjoy!",226.8
"one of the best games i have ever played in my life. anyone who likes board games, or managing should play this game!",277.8
"simply the best strategy game on the market for now. i am a huge fan of the franchise and civilization v is the best game of it.",15.6
"this is game is amazing! i started playing at 10 am and then it was 3 am. :p... this game with the dlc: brave new world. the game gets better than ever. the dlc is a whole new game within another gane!!! buy this game right away or as soon you can. games like this are art and can never be dismissed by gamers! almost ever gamer has or every civilization out there!",21.1
"a great command and conquer styled game. uses the fact of aging through centuries and civilizations and how you can use such advancements to either peacefully join civilizations around you or conquer them all with a giant laser robot.",32.1
"strategy isnt too necessary to play or even win, but when its used, its a game changer. very fun to play with friends or strangers, it doesnt matter.",36.2
"this game sucks so bad i never even bothered to download it -14/10",282.2
"realistic combat simulations with ranged units being able to attack at a farther range than melee units and submarines stealthily firing torpedos at enemys, and lets not forget the massive amouts of nukes that you can produce.",59.3
"very addicting as with most civilization games. replay value is great. 4 stars outa 5.",62.8
"so guys, this game is not just a standard strategy games, this game not like a game where you just need to expand your army and territory, this game is realy realy realistic if you want a empire builder simulator, not just army, you need to consider your people, dont let them starving, your diplomacy, city states, and the other..... if you are try play this game seriously, i think you need more than 15 hours to complete only 1 skirmish in realistic time (marathon in smc v). this game is very very addictive, trust me.",41.3
"very much recommend getting this game the replay value is huge and the modding community is the best",258.6
"i played this game when it was free but put in 6 hours strait and i loved every freaking second of it. never thought id be into these kinds of games being an fps kind of person, but theres something about this game that makes me so happy. maybe its the idea that you can make your own kind of history through your decisions, maybe im a power monger idk. playing with friends is even better, remeber when we made our alliance and stopped the war between quebec and rio? you can have your own loar and history with friends to reminis on or even build your next game off of. all around enjoyable game and i cant wait until the christmas sale to buy it and spend days of my life playing this game. 12/10 freakn amazballs!",65.1
"great game, very fun to play and make decisions with friends.",189.7
"with the brave new world expansion civ5 is probably the best turn based strategy game i have ever played.",85.7
"im not usually a fan of 4x games, but civilization v managed to grab my interest and kept me pressing the next turn button over and over again. definitely get on discount.",4.4
"civilization 5 is a great strategic game to play with friends.",141.2
"endless hours...endless.. do not play on a work night.",120.0
"this game is magnificent. everytime i load it up i cant help but play all day. this game is one of the best strategy game so far ever created. civ vi anyone?",244.6
"the best strategy game i have ever played and by far the most addicting, if you are willing to sit down for a few hours, this game is amazing.",134.9
"amazing game but if you played command and conquer and liked it and the how short the games are (about an hour on average for me) civizilation is way different kind of the same concept but each game (depending on map size) can take up to all day the shortest game ive had was 3 hours but steam some reason didnt save my longest game so it says i only have 7.5 hours my longest game was 13 hours with maybe an hour of brake time so when you play this you better have alot of time on your hands! id reccomend the elder scrolls map (cant think of the name of the map with all elder scrolls games) and middle earth they are both really cool",36.5
"brilliant strategy game, games last ages sometimes xd",13.3
"ive been hooked on civilization since i played civ 2 on my aunts computer... waited hours to download freeciv in the 90s on dialup in the middle of the night, played that until civ iv came on sale in the 00s. played that until i got civ v as part of a bundle. i thought civ iv was better at first, but there is something to be said for the tactics of civ v that require you to carefully place your units around a city to take it. and think before overrunning too many cities and plunging your empire into revolt. i find myself winning diplomatically more often than conquest now because i enjoy manipulating the city-states with intrigue and finishing their quests, consequently getting all their votes when they start voting in the un. there is also something to be said for the some simplifications over civ iv. also, with brave new world its pretty solid!",335.7
"absolutely perfect. lots of fun if you want to create your own civilization the way you like it. youre free to choose whether you wanna concentrate on military forces and conquest, creating a tiger economy or the leader in technology. each time you start a new game you have to adjust your strategy to starting conditions - the terrain and locations of other players will play a major part in the development of your civilization, and it makes the game interesting even after having finished dozens of games. there are lots of leaders to choose from and each of them has its own pros and cons, including certain bonuses and special units/buildings. civilization v is really engrossing, but dont forget to buy complete edition with all add-ones - the game is not that deep without them.",181.8
"no doubt the best of the best! just one...more...turn!",44.7
"in my opinion, the best game ever. i started meiers civilization with civ rev on xbox 360. this has been a major upgrade and i am looking forward to getting the next game.",131.2
"thoroughly addicted to this game. the chance at a new, more epic start/finish keeps my friends and i from picking up old save games, but its a joy to play multiplayer and learn/conquer amidst good company... hasnt kept me from logging 500+ hours on single player, with more to come. i wish all the maps were fully customizable, but the community is immense and rife with free, custom content. 9/10: im looking at you, deity starting bonuses.",1009.8
"civ is a really well put together game in my mind, if i sit down to play it a bit, i will loose time and it keeps me interested in making my next move. this game fulfills what i see games are suppose to do and that is kill time and have a great experience doing so, and civ 5 does it amazingly. i would reccomend this to anyone looking for a strategy game that is awesome and can be a great source of entertainment!",7.7
"this is a very fun game that requires a long time to beat one game so make sure if you are going to play you have nothing to do for a while",116.4
"ill just play a bit before thanksgiving, annnnd its christmas...",189.7
"one of my forvrite turn base games since civilzation 2, i really higly reccomdend it. as an ameranican i sumbit myself as an russian and as a german prussian i appricaite the advance that the russians made for us!",349.2
"this game is amazing if you want to have a time comusiming game that is fun as hell and even more with friends. i would recommend this game to turn baces gamers, statigect gamers and even history fanatics. one nay i can think of though is that there are some civilisations i would like or expect in the game like australia. but serisoly put australia in as aboriganals. they have been on this earth for centeries.",185.9
"really fun and challenging. when you get the hang of it there is endless amounts of fun to be had such as ghandi taking over the world with a massive army, having ghangis khan be diplimatic, or making other ridiculous scenerios come true.",268.3
"needs more graphic like skyrim. 10/10 because a skyrim mod was make for!",168.6
"im hooked. great for people who enjoy strategy. dlc is worth the money. destroy ghandi before he destroys you.",306.2
"after loosing complete faith in the civilization series when civ v vanilla was released, it was very pleasing indeed to give it another try after a brave new world expansion pack was released. just.....one....more...turn.... - oh how i have missed that feeling",360.0
"this game is not for me. it lacks action and pretty graphics to captivate me. dont get me wrong i like rts games but this too much turn based. that said its a solid game if you are fan of turn based strategy.",21.0
"i did enjoy this game as i enjoyed most games of the series, however i have to say i was a bit dissapointed with the fact you can only annex a city to your civilization by using force. i believe the ability to annex another city to yours by maintaining an ally status with a city-state or by trading with that city for a long period of time, or any other diplomatic take over could improve the playability of the game and make the game more versatile, as i imagine that, with the current settings, a civilization that chooses force over commerce or diplomacy have an advantage early in the game and forces other civilizations to also choose this path in order to survive.",27.8
"i like other rts so i thought i might like this one, but the gameplay is too slow and boring for me to enjoy, it is more turn based tactics (what you build and when instead of how/what you do with it) the units deal a random amount of damage and it becomes just a waiting game until you have completed enough turns to have researched enough things to get to the end-game state, no skill involved to do battles or conquer cities. although it is a good game and i would recommend it to people who enjoy those sort of things, i would recommend most other turn-based rts out there *cough* total war *cough* just not my cup of tea",12.4
"probably the greatest turn-based strategy game of our generation. absolutely perfect.",245.9
"civ v is a very fun and complex simulation where you start out in the ancient era and progress through time to become the dominant civilization of the world. there are different types of victories. there is the science victory where you need to launch a spaceship up to space. there is the domination victory where you need to take control of all the capitals of the world. there is the diplomatic victory where you need to become the world leader in world congress. then there is finally the cultural victory where you need to become culturally influential over all the civilizations by creating pieces of art and performing concerts. i overall rate this game 10/10.",86.5
"for the love of god, dont buy this game! youll end up completely without time and the just one more turn... will be your most frequent sentence! not much more needs to be said. maybe that if you feel like buying it, buy the comlete edition. and, of course, that this game is awesome. now, if you excuse me, i think i wanted to play some mass effect and dark souls... but damn it, im gonna end up with civilization again!",416.7
"played as mongol empire. 20 mins in - destroyed 10 city states. op 11/10",28.3
"this game has its ups and downs: the ups can be from the statisfaction of winning a near loss victory or maybe completely wiping out some  in a war that you could only justify out of fustration with them. the downs can come from the complete failure early on in a game that has a some militarisitic  steam rolling your cultural civilization before it can get past turn 50 (im looking at you napolean!). but overall this game is an experience in itself to play with a friend or by yourself. it builds its character and charm from the antics you pull on friends during a cooperative play through, or from the complete hypocrisy of some a.i in corelation to the leader they are playing as (cough cough ghandi cough cough). all in all, civ 5 is a good game that is fun enough to validate multiple playthroughs, which i think is really important for games to be able to have nowadays.",132.8
"very entertaining. the ai never cease to amaze and bewilder me.",67.0
"great game, love it. indepth strategy and great turn based playing.",181.8
"the game is ok but very similar to past civilzations. i would buy when it was on a special offer but not at 29,99",66.9
"ill play for just a few rounds. wait, when did the sun come up? 10/10",220.2
"very good game. hours of strategy fun. great for challenging friends and laerning a little about history at the same time! what not to love? 9/10",578.5
"i love this game. i got into civ through revolution but this is a very good game, anything it came short on compared to civ 4? mods can make up for. i think more people should play it. the gameplay itself is addicting. it gets boring at times but its always fun to make up the history of your people as you go. the modding ive never been able to do myself or implent mods into games manually but the game helps a lot and gives you a list of mods you have. and if you want more mods go to the workshop and search for the one you want",689.1
"a great game! i wish sid meier could make civilization vi, and the leader for america would be teddy roosevelt in honor of deceased actor robin williams, and the leader for russia would be vladmir putin. the gameplay for civilization vi would be like sid meiers civilization beyond earth, along like civ v",147.0
"if you dont have this game.... you have no taste in good games.... or youve never heard of it. in which case, buy it ffs!",114.4
"i grew up playing civ 3. i never fully understood how the game was played so i put it away for a time. now, 6 years later, i decide to get back into the series by purchasing civ 5. love the game! firaxis has done so much with the series since i last played and it all makes sense and works incredibly well. i would recommend this game to anyone.",24.2
"its a good civ game, on its own right, in the absolute sense. if you just walked onto it with no comparison to anything but tv and books, this would be a fantastic game.",107.0
"realy cool game much better than age of empires and others like it",56.1
"this is the type of game where you tell yourself just one more turn and then find yourself going to bed at $ in the morning. an absolute blast to play, and a game you definitely cannot miss. ive never been too interested in strategy games before playing civ 5, but it has really been a hell of a fun time to play. with steam sales you can pick it up for real cheap, so dont even hesitate next time it goes for 75% off.",20.8
"the new tile format really adds to the challenge level of the game. a definate improvement over civ 4!",23.0
"civ v is probably the best strategy game out there. i prefer it over beyond earth by far. even without civ vs dlc, its still better than beyond earth imo. its well put together. i enjoy the historical characters and their personalites, even gandhis. its gameplay is so much more immersive than the other strategy games ive played.. only thing i can say that even might be negative about this game would be... just one more turn. 10/10",294.8
"i dont know about the first release of this game and the problems it had. i didnt play it at the time because my computer was not able to run it properly. however, after a few patches and dlcs i must say that this is the best civilization ever, and i played them all ! the interface is a masterpiece. it truly hides the incredible layers of complexity that are behind this game. if you played other civ games you know how painful and repetitive some tasks were. not anymore. on the negative side, as always, diplomacy. it is still very simplistic. wars should have a casus belli and relationships (friends becoming enemies and viceversa) should be better managed. a diplomacy model like the one used in paradox games would be very welcome.",180.2
"one of the best games i have ever played, hours of fun with this. a must buy!!!",326.8
"an awesome game that has been loved for ages through all the games it has",39.1
"civ 5 is a fun game but unplayable in mp because of bugs developers are too lazy to fix. this should not be a full price game with 95% of its core player group who enjoy multiplayer that cant play",354.0
"great game. i have played a few of the civ games and liked them to varying degrees. civ 5 though has probably the best all around game play though. i thoroughly enjoy both the long and short run games. the workshop makes the game even more fun. i also highly recommend all the dlcs as they add a lot of unique features that increase the playability of the game and various scenarios that can be quite challenging",332.6
"this is an amazing game... it trains your brain. ans also the graphics are stunning for this type of game. its a turn-on!!!",1059.0
"this game has taught me one thing; if ghandi cant peacefully protest, hell initiate thermonucleur war. 10/10 for murderous ghandi.",92.0
"if you are fed up with socializaing and want to fly hermit-style, i highly recommend the civilization method.",103.2

"friend introduced me to this game and have played 150 hours of it, crazy for this game and cant wait to get civ be and for civ vi",231.3
"it is a really great game and i love it but i was looking at dlcs and i found the packet for 50$ (american) and i got so mad at myself because i realized that there was the packet i could have bought instead so pretty much wasted 30 dollars on the basic game when i could have bought the packet. so this is more to the owners of steam to make something where you can return a game and get your money back. if there is please email me to tell me where it is so i can get the packet instead of buying the packet on top of the basic game i have already downloaded. please",87.7
"been so long since ive actually played these games way back when. but ill never got sick of games like this one, love it.",399.2
"fantastic game, just like the rest of the civilization series. very detailed gameplay and will keep you entertained for hours.",30.1
"oh my snick-snack patty-whack give this game a bone! this is one of the greatest turn-based strategy games out there, please give this game a chance because it it absolutely astonishing!",240.3
"wow. ive played this for, like, 50 hours, but only actually opened the game 7 times. wow.",55.5
"very positive feeling, playing this game. not only you have different fractions, which are worth to play through by themselves, but also randomised sets of rules, makes it worth playing for months! nice graphics, for every video card!",35.1
"the ultimate 4x game. its the most polished 4x game around, anyone who is interested in the genre should get it. it might not end up being your favourite, but you will get a lot of joy from this wonderful game regardless. just make sure to get the dlc.",151.9
"a great game... provides hours upon hours of gameplay. keeps you interested with random maps, opponents and many ways to win the game. it allows every player to adapt to their play style and if they get bored with it to try a different way to win.",115.4
"best strategy game ever. this game is beautiful, it is amazing. why is it so good? because, the detail is amazing, plus the maps you play on are amazing, each civilization has it own unique benefit. if anybody is think about buying it, it is worth your money. one of the best games ive ever played",109.8
"there is not enough words to describe how amazingly fun this game is and i have yet to meet someone who doesnt enjoy playing the game :) there are a variety of courses you can choose to go whether you choose to destroy everyone in your path or possibly be a diplomatic leader who strives in culture. the game is extremely fun when you play with your friends and like monopoly it seems to take forever to actually finish. you dont have to play with friends, but it certainly can bring a new edge to the game unlike playing against npcs. in conclusion, if you are looking for a long lasting enjoyable game that you can play by yourself or with friends, then look no further ^_^",64.8
"sid meier is to stategy games as george lucas is to star wars. the most comprehensive and easy to use turned based strategy game to date.",225.1
"this is based on a game where you can expand you can kill and you can recruit",50.2
"oh civilization v....theres too much to say honestly. if youve played the board game risk before, this is a much more detailed version of that with options other than military domination to lead to victory. if you havent played risk, then this is more like a very complicated version of chess where what you do off the chess board matters too. and if you havent played either of those...this game probably isnt for you. civilization v is a turn-based strategy game at its core, and it is damn good at what it does. however, i do not personally reccommend to purchase this without its dlc bundle, as the main game by itself, doesnt have quite the kick and a lot changes with the dlc additions. i give this game a 9 / 10. definitely worth the pick up if you like strategy or turn-based games.",77.0
"maaaaaaate. i lost 3 children to this game. they all starved because i forgot they existed. but i ing showed gandhi what for.",96.7
"will give positive review when i can buy complete edition without repaying for original game.",30.9
"excellent game with an incredible modding community, engrossing, engaging and most of all loads of fun. definitely for anyone who enjoys turn based and strategy. for players of all types, domination, science, culture, religion, something for everyone.",390.4
"this game is amazing. i recommend this game to anyone that loves stratedgy and other games in thatg area. note this, those that hate this game will be a dead civilization. it is unpredictable, interesting, and very, very fun. enjoy the game fellow gamers.",92.4
"so much could be said for civ 5. including the expansion packs - gods & kings and brave new world - it is easily the best civ game ever made. every game is different and customizable to a great degree. multiplayer can be a joyous role-playing experience. the game allows for enough variation in decision-making that single player is just as fascinating. ive played all of the civ games going back to the first, and i cant imagine how amazing it would be to have civ 5 be the first one played. a proper review of this game would require 5,000 words. in short, it is a massive, and now polished, simulator combining the conventional history of humanitys story on planet earth with a solid gaming experience. anyone who is interested in strategy games has to play this.",430.6
"this game is only 30 bucks and if you play this game right, you can play for hundreds of hours. must buy over any other game close to this genre, civ beyond earth sucks.",574.9
"one of the best strategic games with multiple victory types compared to some strategic games in which you win by domination.quite addictive once you start playing, you should try it!",454.5
"this is the perfect game if you have no friends. once you get this game you wont need them. if you have friends...eh screw them.",46.9
"keris warrior, most op unit. horrible ai that force you to kill them all because of they filthy mouth and annoying city spawn. you can invent internet before computer. why build swordsman (beside keris warrior) if you can straight to musketeer? done on researching ship of the line? time to conquer the world, noob. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- actually my playing time is more than 1000 hours on the dark side of the port.",24.4
"civilization v is one of the best turn based strategy games ive ever played. the graphics are great, the replay value is high, and there are multiple ways to win (you can easily play this game without having to get a military victory). all in all, it is a fantastic game. the only flaw i can find is that the game is relatively easy without mods. overall i give it an 8.5/10, its worth a buy.",34.7
"absolutely the best strategy game ive ever played.",241.0
"an exceptional and highly polished game with dlc that is pretty solid. i love it!",130.0
"10/10 would invade germany with stealth bombers again and again.",18.5
"i spent 4 hours on this game in a single match. it was worth it.",149.9
"ok so now i have played for 609 hours since the game has come out, and now they are coming out with a new expansion,brave new world that is going to change up the cultureal victory and make diplomacy more important, and will introduce, trade routes, turism, and a revamped civics tree that will make you choose between 3 ways of building your empire in the late game, and artifacts to put into your museums, as well as 9 new civs to play, and i will most likely play another 200 hrs before getting tired of this game... the shosone, portugal, and assyria, and venetians seem too be the most intersting to play out the 9 new civs, and shaka is back...hide your women and children....lol",905.1
"really fun game, especially when you play with freinds :p",59.8
"vanilla is adequate. gods & kings is useless (included in bnw). brave new world is great. the mods, however, define the reason why i love this game. pro - purchase it and see how quickly 5:30pm turns into 4:45am. con - purchase it and see how quickly 5:30pm turns into 4:45am. con - mods disable achievements (understandable).",528.8
"infact one of my favorite games, this game lets you customize your own empire through power or diplomancy. even science and culture. however without the gods and kings and brave new world expansions (also babylon) the game gets boring. however with the 2 expansions the game is a masterpeice. civ5 vanilla: 5/10 civ5 expansions: 10/10 (also buy complete instead of paying for dlcs later, 50$ for complete yet around 100$ for all the dlc sepreatly)",475.7

"get it. you can be assyria and develop the nuke. you will enjoy it.",144.3

"money, power, world domination of the commonwealth",167.6
"this game is its own genre. as of such, it cannot be compared to anything else. but, comparing it to every other game ever, it still holds it own quite well. 10/10",66.1
"my only experience with civilization before civ5 was freeciv, and this game is a big improvement! note, though, that it may not actually run on your linux install. i have to boot into windows to actually play it, which of course means i only play it very rarely. this is sad, because its a good game. if you run linux, only buy this if its on a serious sale; that way, if it doesnt work, you arent out the full price.",65.7
"the more you play this game the better gets. you cant just sit down and play this for a few minutes you needs hours and hours to even make dent in the amoutn of gameplay needed to really get things going. all in all 10/10 strategy game, would play again...and again...and again....",85.3
"build empires, wage wars, and control the fate of nations in civilization v.",394.4
"never really liked civilization, then 4 came out and i was like okay... this is enjoyable but then civ 5 came out, daaaamn son, i was impressed, i was actually really having fun with a turn-based strategy game, wonderful mechanics, wonderful engine and amazing graphics, also nice modding community 9/10",182.6
"you can build the great wall of china, in britain, not historically accurate but its awesome. i love this game it doeant have the massive scale of total war but its much more simple, and you can make a lot of choices ranging from, how smart you want the other civilizations to be to how much yummy yummy iron you want in your area. its great!",60.6
"an excellent game spoiled badley by the fact that it crashes more than a zx80 on a warm day !",434.3
"pros and cons pros:better graphics workshop support (woo polandball mod!) good dlc cons:slower than past games (at least for me) religion costs 30 dollars slightly confusing (it took me 5 minutes to figure out where the civilopedia was) you should still buy it though",276.6
"played as gabe newell and kiled all console peasants. 10/10",66.7
"civ v is not civ iv. but that does not mean that civ v isnt worth playing. the loss of civics, religions, and multiple civ choices is offset by the hex grid, ranged units, and unique civilization traits. i highly reccomend this title, even if sid meier is bleeding us dry with dlc!",534.4
"this game has the most replayability i have ever seen. not just map changes, or nations, but how they all interact to produce a whole game. playing this game for over 300 hours and it has never been the same game twice. keeps you on your feet and worth the price.",405.6
"better if you get the dlc (brave new world & gods + kings)",61.5
"really enjoyable, especially if you have a not-so-good pc like me.",33.2
"ok, this game is basically- build a city, upgrade it, go crazy building units, and take over the world! (also some other small victories) in this game you want to build up your civ and to survive until you cant be beat. expert game in multiplayer, so i suggest giving it a try, and also to get this game!",158.9

"do not buy this game. if you do... there is no going back. just one turn and your life is gone. you keep thinking to yourself: just... one... more... turn...... but it is no use. you cant stop. you have been addicted. 1000/10 best and most addictive game in the history of man.",238.0
"civilization v is a great game if you have all the 2 major dlc which is gods & kings and brave new world. i love playing with my friends in this game and hour go by like minutes... tons of fun!!! 10/10",176.2
"this is one of those games that makes you just play the original again. it was really fun on my first play-through, but by my third i realized that aside from aribitrary choices the games were the same, and looked the same even on different planet types with different civs. as far as i can tell there is no replay value. where civ v has had me playing at least once a month since i got it, im typing this review because it seems more fun than loading up beyond earth right now. there are no science/cultural/domination/diplomatic victories. winning is tied to quests and building certain buildings youve researched. i thing 2/3rds of the replay value of civ v was trying different types of victories and different civs. this has none of that. its nostalic, pretty at first glance, but its a ization of civ v, worth only one play through. its very expensive dlc at best. solid c grade product.",882.1
"feels very great when you win after a full 8 hour long game. you can either play the game simple or go in-depth and micromanage a lot. but dont play it without the expansions. best played online with people you know on voice chat, so much comedy can happen",280.9
"sid meier is a genius. this is a fact. civ 5 is unquestionably the best development of the series since civ 2. civ 1 is of course legend. i was less impressed by civ 3 and 4, but hey they are still great games. by this game, by all of them. you wont be disappointed.",53.3
"a brilliant game and a must for any strategy players, all victory types and technologies are brilliant and the game never becomes dull 10/10",45.9
"very fun and exciting strategic game i think ill never stop playing",187.9
"incredible game for the casual or veteran tbs gamer. combines easy-to-use interface with dynamic (for the most part) environments and world domination aspects. playing with friends is even better than playing alone. allows creation and download of community-made mods for more interesting gameplay. vanilla is nothing compared to brave new world. if you like civ v in its original form, you should definitely buy bnw.",171.1

"civ v fixes bad combat of civ games from silly stacks. expansions are must have, because without them game feels empty and shallow. definately step forward in series.",122.9
"one of the best games in my steam inventory, combines history with fun tactical gaming to produce a game which will have you hooked for hours. on its own civ v is a good game but with the dlcs it is a masterpiece which truely reflects the rise of real civilisations. huge number of civs to play as combined with many different map moads means that you wont be bored for the first few days you buy this game. so in short an absolutly great game which i would recommend to anyone who is looking for a game about building might nations.",418.1

"i have been playing civ since the first dos version and i own every iteration of the game since, including now - beyond earth. civ for me is the gamers game - like chess - its open ended, always different, challenging and educational too ! - the interface is stunning. this is the only game that has kept me up all night long to day break - where still i just have to click - one - more - time .......",229.5

"ive put a good few hours into this game, and i must say, if you want an awesome looking game with satisfactory strategic gameplay and a good challenge, go ahead and get it. countless replayability and good mods make this game that much better too. 8.5/10",192.3

"extremely fun game, i just dont recommend this to someone running apple os. it always freezes completly to the point that i have to do a cold reset. forums online talk about how its not a computer problem because if you run bootcamp with windows and play the exact same game i guess its fine. probablly going to stop playing because its very frustrating to have to keep reseting my computer. oh well...",13.9
"extremely fun strategy game. allows you to take control of a civilization and better the world or raise hell in it. the game is good without the expansion packs but with them the game becomes a masterpiece. every move counts and you have to really think about what you do far in advance. the game itself isnt very user friendly so if you plan to buy it watch a tutorial here",121.4
"also the game is much better with friends. a must buy for strategy gamers. 9/10 hope this helps and have fun with the game. :)",0.1

"this game is its own genre. as of such, it cannot be compared to anything else. but, comparing it to every other game ever, it still holds it own quite well. 10/10",66.1
"my only experience with civilization before civ5 was freeciv, and this game is a big improvement! note, though, that it may not actually run on your linux install. i have to boot into windows to actually play it, which of course means i only play it very rarely. this is sad, because its a good game. if you run linux, only buy this if its on a serious sale; that way, if it doesnt work, you arent out the full price.",65.7
"by far the best game of the past four years that i have played lots of great content for time killing!",611.1

"ill write this review any second now, just one more turn... and another... and another...",110.6
"its very lengthy and well crafted but dont buy it until youre absolutely sure all dlc is included in the package. i thought i had the pack with all dlc in it, but i was wrong. the dlc alone costs 75% of the games price to complete it and i absolutely cannot stand incomplete games in my list so i really wish theyd just do content updates or real expansions, not all this dlc spam. the game itself is a solid 6.5/10 though. multiplayer games are usually thrown by your opponent who understandably doesnt want to sit around for 2 hours waiting for you to finish killing him. single player is fun for a game or two. on the higher difficulties youre usually either getting trashed hard or trashing hard. for a strategy game it doesnt really involve that much strategy, more or less what you choose to research and how many cities you build decides the game.",48.5
"its enjoyable right up until about the 1900s, then the game really slows down when there are more untis and turns take excrutiatingly long to manage, especially when at war. war takes way too long to fight out, the system for battle should be much quicker. i would have recommended this before, but now i think its fundamentally flawed due to the time investment required when at war.",103.8

"i absolutley like this game except for the fact that it randomly stops work by exiting me out. i have lost so much technology so pls help me stop this!",65.3
"probabely the most addiciting game ive ever played. this is the type of game that play you can play hours on without even realising. ive played it endless times and i still love it. the community mods are a big factor in re-playability and will keep you testing new mods aswell as the insane improvements that the dlcs add. it is true that the begininning is really boring however, later in the game you start making game plans which can go horribly wrong. especially when you trust ghandi... but in all seriousness its one of my favorite games and i really reconmend anyone to play it, even though the new civ is out 9-10/10",490.8
"great great great!!!! unlimited hours of gameplay and fun :)",88.5
"not much to say other than its a great game. ive spent plenty of hours planning moves, building troops and utterly destroying other colonies and countries. really fun game if you like turn based, strategy games",303.0

"if you love a little challenge and enjoy something that is similar to age of empires, but far surpasses it in content and style, this game is for you! its well worth the time invested (and cost of the game plus dlc) in raising your empire from humble beginnings, working your way up to killing barbarians, making trade deals and expanding your empire through the ages. mods make this game 100x better in my personal opinion but everyone likes their own thing. good turn based combat, decent graphics, fun gameplay and an easy time sink for fun.",308.3
"its an amazing experience if you can get past te grafical glitches + bugs",71.2
"just pure awesomeness... havent been so addcited to a game since pokemon.",33.1
"this game is simply awesome. the art is good, and while there is no story, you get the feeling that you have the power to write it yourself through the actions you take in civilization. my only qualm is that it can be a little buggy at times, particularly in multiplayer (good god). the gameplay is also very enjoyable and fun.",145.2

"great fun civ v has great single palyer and for me runs smoothly. however multiplayer on the other had is terrible. you cant stay in a single, well functioning game for more than 10 turns at the most. i would recommend for people who will play it single player but would recommending not buying it for multiplayer until a patch is released.",626.2

"been a fan of civilization and other sid meiers games since i started playing pc games. this one will not let you down and the vastness of cheap dlc that enhance the base game and throw new challenges make for an easy thumbs-up on this game. buy at whatever price and rack up on the dlc when it goes on sale.",1084.4
"great game, always loved civ games. i was very glad to see civ5 beeing released on linux. it worked great for a few months, however recently the game started crashing while playing and that is a pitty. crashes are not very common maybe every 2 - 3 hours. neverless it would be great if it would not crash at all :)",402.8

"absolutely amazing game. love it. you do need to buy at least gods and kings + brave new world to make the game better than civ iv, and the combat is a bit, well clunky, but aside from that it is one of the best strategy games on pc right now. 10/10.",341.2

"although i havent gone through the game fully, it already is great. those who enjoy running civilization and strategy this game is for you. not as nice to total war, the civilization series has many great games including this one. ive played civilization revolution for my ps3 and felt confined, i forgot i bought this game, so i saw it and started it up, already feeling the same i gave it a few minutes, which became hours and it became addicting, but fun :d. the create game setup is a bit elaborate but navigable. play as many leaders from around the world from washington to napoleon, beijing to moscow, your choices will have a lasting impact and you must find a way to victory, as there are multiple ways. see you on the virtual globe!",81.4

"once, it was about 11 oclock on a saturday. i had just finshed downloading civ v the night before, so i decided i would play it. i just kept on playing and playing until i got tired. i thought wow, it feels like ive been playing for 4 hours! i should take a break. so i turned off the game and checked the time. it said 5:34 am. i had just played for 18 hours sraight without eating. 9/10",66.8
"while it isnt my favorite game (in the sense that ive played other games more and like to play them more, not that i dislike this game) it is definitely up there on the list. its indefinitely replayable, so that adds to the value of it as well. its fun enough that if you like this type of game, youll probably get caught up enough in it that youll end up playing for hours and hours and realize the sun is going down (or coming up haha). but if you want my opinion, if this game is on sale or something, there really isnt any reason not to buy it at this point.",235.3

"addicting!!! watch the clock when you are playing this game because time will get away very easy! the games very good though there are some little things like getting a boat traped when another player buys slots around it and if you move it war breaks out.....but other than that its a very good game if you like board games like settlers of katan this is the game for you!

"if you like strategy, this is the game for you. having piled a lot of hours into this game i find that you really need lots of friends to play this game online, to get a proper solid experience. i find that you can only dominate the bots a few dozen games until you get bored. also a fantastic thing about it is that it keeps growing and changing, the teams still working on it, and best of all each match can run for several hours (if not days). add to all of that the fact that you can at any time play with one of the many mods available, and youve got a great experience! 10/10",426.5

"a very fun and addictive tile-based/turn-based simulation like game where you get to choose a civilization to play as and walk it through the different eras of history. theres tons of civilizations to choose from, and several ways to win, from killing everyone else to going to the moon. the fun never stops (but its a bit tricky when two civilizations that are both stronger than you attack you at the same time) in this great game.",38.6

"good game, was russia, expanded my empire, end up fighting their riflemen with giant death robots, had 30 uranium, launched at least 20+ nuclear missles, turned world into radiation hell. needless to say i controlled every city on the map and dropped nukes on myself and still won. 10/10",448.2
"civ is great as it isnt something you can beat in the first few games, you have to play over and over with friends and by yourself to learn all the different strategies as what works for rome might not work for england. however you do have to change the setting to your preference as you may not like your screen juming around from troop to troop with out you telling it to do so.",165.3
"simply put, this is one of the best games ive ever played. even with the vanilla civ v, i spent countless hours playing just one more turn. with gods and kings and the brave new world expansions, the game only got better. i paid full price for almost all the civ v dlcs and expansions, but it was worth it --- and i have more than 600 hours of playing time to prove it. ive had the sun rise on me many, many times, whether playing civ v alone or with friends. the depth and complexity of this game ensures that every playthrough will be different, every decision interesting. and as if the game isnt nearly perfect already, it still gets improvements 4 years after its initial launch! this game is a true classic, a standard by which other games of its kind will always be measured and is a must-have for any strategy game lover.",601.0
"honestly one of the best games i have ever played. the replayability is unreal. i own the complete version and the dlc just adds so much depth to the game. the only problem i have is how hard mods are to install. pros gameplay ui replayability depth graphics mods (though limited they are there) cons sometimes wish there were more diplomacy options wish i had more control over my citizens sometimes",44.7
"extreamly fun game to play! would defintly recommend!",85.1

"i had this game for a few days on one of the steam play for 3 days things. before i was expecting it to be very fun because many of my friends had it. then i turned it on and played. it was so much more fun and addicting than i thought it would be. i thought that a turn based rts made of tiles would be pretty dull. but it was amazing! i only got to log 11 hours on it before the event ended. next time it goes on sale i am definatly going to buy it.",78.8

"sid meiers civilization v also known as civ 5 was the first game that brought combat simulation and real world tactics toghether to create a seamless game where you can destory or protect both friends and foes. the dlc packs: gods & kings and brave new world are overpriced at $25 each however they did provide just enough content to satisfy me. i think because there is such an active community making new mods and maps this game will continue in the future with more dlc being released, fingers crossed it provides more bang for your buck. overall great game with awesome simulation and many factors within the gameplay. :) great game! 9/10",36.9

"if someone asked me what game i would reccomend to introduce them to pc gaming, i would immediatly reccomend this. this has been one of the more involving and rewarding games i have ever played, and would reccomend it to anyone. i will go ahead and say that if you have never played a similar game to this before, there is a pretty steep learning curve that will at first be overwhelming, but power through and you will understand why this game recieves such high praises.",50.8

"id easily say, that over the years, the civilization series has never failed to please, with various dlc packs guaranteed with each iteration, the game constantly stays fresh, and challenging, slight downfall however, is the grind that some players may face while playing this game, some lose interest, some do not, but if you strongly enjoy real time strategy games, and want a change, civilization is a perfect turn based strategy to play. 8/10, i play this game frequently.",80.3
"the plot of this game involves escaping from dachau in 1944, and fleeing to yugoslavia. there, you join up with a local resistance group to break into hitlers private residence in order to liberate the darkest of kushes. after this you are taken by the kgb to a soviet gulag and tortured for days by being subjected to insane clown posse for hours on end. eventually, you leave and go on to lead the nation of israel to glory, before mecha-hitler returns in the year 2139 and eliminates the unpure races. 10 / 5 would experience again",18.5

"civilization v is definately different than any other civ game ive played in the past. the strategy you have to put into this one is so much more than the stackable tiles from before. the hex tile system is something to get used to, but once you do, it is a blast. definately recommend to any war strategy game player.",287.7

"you click stuff and some magic things happen on the moving picture.",46.1
"good game, wish new one was remotely close to this",382.9
"the game is great, but the problem is me and many other players are facing the same problems. workers stop working and stop building roads, and they dont seem to care much for enemys they just stand there from time to time and stop working. this is making the game very difficult. pls help fix this i really love the game i spent so much time in it. i have send letter for help but got nothing.",65.2

"waay too slow. i even walked away from my pc at one point. came back an hour later, nothing had happened. i dont get it. only buy if you have alot of time on your hands",351.8
"i am enjoying this game when playing it with friends, well, for the most of the time. will recommend it if you got people to play with in multiplayer. games can take quite some time though depending on the speed you choose and if you wanna finish it in one sitting then prepare for 20 hours of a day spent...or maybe even more.",80.6
"this game is the worlds slowest marathon... and i cant get enough of it. ill admit, when you start to reach endgame (1800s-2000s), 9/10 times i just get bored and end the game through warfare, but the first few thousand years are so much fun, i keep coming back for more... i love the battle for territory and the fragile relationships with the other leaders, i almost always take perks to increase the rate of border expansion for increased chance of conflict. overall, the game costs to much, pick it up on sale and you wont be sorry!",272.9
"this game does not even start up or anything. does not work.",17.7
"with the bnw expansion the game is now very deep and enjoyable. there are many different and well-balanced paths to victory. as someone who started playing civ 2, it has taken me awhile to adjust to civ 5. they may have the same names but they are fundmentally different games. in one the key to win was near constant expansion and the creation of doom stacks. civ 5 is pleasantly different. pros: culture system is finally come into its own ai is no longer horrible at war all systems well balanced and thoughtful stratagy is rewarded cons: the non-cheating ai (prince) is still not nearly as good at the gam e as any human",133.1
"after many hours of playing this game is excellent when you just want to sit back and enjoy a even paced game. it can be a bit slow playing against other people, but then again i dont have the skillz to hold up against most people who play this online.",272.2

"i dig this game, its challenging took me some time to become profficient, not a typical rts",108.5
"strange to not recommend this, given the countless hours spent playing it, but it has many annoyances that sid meier (or whoever) needs to address. the military aspect of the game remains tedious, as it was in all the previous versions. few of the systems make much sense. why, if you spend lots of resources building big ben but someone pips you to building it first, does your big ben disappear? why can a great artist do a culture bomb? why bother turning your generals into citadels, when opposing armies can just walk round them and you can only stack one unit inside? i could go on. suffice to say, civ needs some more competition.",256.4
"i cant recommend this game highly enough. there are so many different ways to play, to win and to lose. not to mention the virtually limitless replay value.",66.3
"firaxis and 2k are becoming my new favourite game studios, very much thanks to civ v and xcom... this is one of the most complete games ive ever played.",45.9
"i have always had a soft spot in my heart for grand strategy games. this 4x game hits all the right sweet spots. pick a civilization to conquer the world through diplomacy, culture or military might! there are lots of options to gameplay, and many scenarios to try out. i thoroughly enjoyed many of the european ones. there are lots of mods that can bring new blood into the game once you have become bored after many hours of play. i would definetly recomend this game to anyone who enjoys playing complex board games, because that is basically what this is, a giant board game. lots of fun! 5/5",51.2
"very cool strategy game. love it and recommend it to all. you will have tons of fun playing",0.4
"great game but needs more options so that i can make more than opne or two of a unit before its obsolete and cant build... eras move way too fast without option of control... only complaint....... edit: cant play past turn 500 due to late game lagg... its very horrible........... so you spend weeks playing just to get screwed over in your final moves to win the game..... very frustrating!!!!!1",542.4

"epic game, emotional and stratigic! quite relaxing. 8/3",38.9
"sid meirs civilization v is a easy get to know if your a starter at strategy games. the dlcs add mroe complex things which allows the starter to enchance their experience and become a intermedient. civ v is basically a building block from where you can decide which strategy games you choose in the future that offer more challenging experiences. overall civ is a great game and is highly reccommend if your just getting insterested in stategy. if your a right on pro at strategy games get civ still because why not? greece pwns 10/10",665.7
"i have played 20 minutes so far and i dont know what i am doing, i literally walk around trying to figure out how to build a city because i am too lazy to read the tutorial or open google. its fun destroying barbarian camps though.",0.4
"whats there to say about civilizations 5 except it provides epic proportions of nation building, conquest, and even diplomacy and trade with the new dlc. if you like building empires or armies then you should get civilization 5. if you have played too much of civilization 5 and dont own the dlc then you are missing out. i would wait until all the dlc is bundled togeather along with civilization 5. you know it is only a matter of time until that is done again since there is a new civilization game coming out shortly. also there is a massive mod community, albiet something i have not explored much, which can provide tons of new experiences on top of the normal game.",210.0
"civilization 5. pretty damn good if youre into turn based strategy games. the game unfortunatly requires some dlc to get the full experience. if you finish a game youll probably realize how deep this game goes. there is multiple ways to play and this creates a replayable heaven.",824.7
"i love and still love this game the best civilisation game yet :)",170.2
"one of the most awesome games ive ever played, extremely addictive... great gameplay and the historical details on units, buildings and civilization leaders makes this game a masterpiece of his kind. the new religion system is an improvement to the one used on civ iv and the battle system is also much better. still, i miss the wonder videos and certain things like corporations that civ iv had.",248.0
"10/10 would play a another turn! seriously though, its an above averge game without the dlcs, but with them... its a totally different game, its just insane! yuffo, out.",146.0
"when this game first came out it really felt like it was missing so much. it looked better than 3 and 4 visually but i felt like it didnt have to same level of complexity. after a few expansions it seemed to catch up but i still prefer 4 over 5. obviously i have logged several hours as it is a good game, but i was a bit disappointed because of how i expected it to be compared to its predecessors. 6/10",179.4
"its better than civ 4s  unit stacking and  cultural borders and civ 2s ageing system. not as good as civ iii. there i said it!",28.5

"well, who wouldnt wanna play this game? a great strategy game that you must have in your collection. in case you plan on playing civilization on older laptop. go for the civilization 3 version, as this one tends to bog down old laptops.",15.3
"an alright game, but not worth its price... get it on sale. it crashes a lot in multiplayer games, and the singleplayer ai is quite dumb. i could reccomend it if it were cheaper, but not for $50 for all the dlcs and the game...",217.5

"a quite interesting update to a great series. the new map sytem allows for much more variation in land types around a city, as well as allowing much more control over how the resources within your field of influence are worked. the strategic resources look like an interesting change as well, though ive not quite gotten to use those as much as i would like.",60.0
"this game keeps on quitting on mac and has a couple of graphic problems on windows",284.9

"to start i have all the dlc for the game and i feel it is almost a must to have all the dlc because i feel otherwise the game is not as in depth as the last game in the series. i love the ai it really feels fresh and alive and each civ has its own personality and that makes the game allot of fun. over all if you get this game with out the dlc i feel you are missing out on a very interesting experiance and with out the dlc the game does not feel like its complete. hope you enjoy the game as much as i do =)",167.3

"great fun civ v has great single palyer and for me runs smoothly. however multiplayer on the other had is terrible. you cant stay in a single, well functioning game for more than 10 turns at the most. i would recommend for people who will play it single player but would recommending not buying it for multiplayer until a patch is released.",626.2

"very nice game i highly recommend this game!!!!!!!",71.6
"civilization 5 is a turn-based strategy game where the player has to advance their faction to achieve victory . graphically changes little from their predecessors and the new system of hexagons areas does not bring anything new. the progression between ages is good and the factions are balanced . disappoints the political system that is a little boring, but its still playable. my vote is 7/10",57.0
"whats not to like about civilization v? the title that was famous for one more turn is once again back with a vengeance. the new fully rendered leader speech and full facial animation depending on your nations relationship is only the icing on the cake. there are a lot more improvements being introduced in this latest installment. the one i enjoyed the most is the new grid introduction. this made combat feels a bit more strategic as you have more room to manuever and at the same time attacked. if you still have not purchased this game yet, i strongly recommend it. just make sure you leave 72 hours of your time free.",178.2

"if you want an epic, extremely well thought out, well executed game, play this. my friend, who is a major civ junkie, says that civ iii is really the height of the civ series, but from my experience i can say with complete confidence that civ v is totally an incredible game. you have thousands of little levers you can pull to try to make your empire as powerful, inspiring, and in general as amazing as possible, and they all really immerse you into the experience. plus, you can learn a ton about history from the little articles theyve put into the information book in the game. one thing to mention: the game is completely different with the dlc. and playing really is ideal with both expansions. if you can get this with both of them, youre going to enjoy the game a lot more.",79.0

"this is the best game i have ever played! althoe without dlc it can become a bit boring, but it is still awesome. if you have palyed games like pandora, previous civs or xcom you are going to love it. no matter how you play war or you just like to turtle both types are equally fun. get this game!",375.4
"gandhi denounced my civilization so i nuked every city in his empire 11/10",64.2
"solo play? sure, this is a great game. multiplayer? have fun with the re-sync. its going to haunt you every 1-3 turns. a patch to fix bugs ruined the game completely, and this was a month ago. firaxis has a track history of not releasing patches for millenia, so im not expecting one any time soon. only buy this if youre in it for the single-player gameplay. if youre not, wait for the next patch, if there is one.",322.2
"civ 5 was a bit disappointing after its release, but it got much better with the expansions and although i still have some reservations about some game mechanics (especially in comparison with civ 4), it is definitely worth playing.",445.5

"eight playthroughs later and this game is still just as fun and thought povoking as the first. whether youre a warmongering tyrant, an inovative scientist, or a diplomatic politician, there is something for any style of leader in this game. what makes this game even more exciting is the mod system that was not only intigrated but encouraged. id recommend this game to anyone who enjoy games like stratego, risk, or chess.",69.4
"this game look very good, indeed, i like the complex of each turn, unique and interesting. i can not get out of this just....one...more...turn",95.2

"its the turning point of this war. the battle for the south ends with just 3000 of my infantry surviving. we make camp, heal up, and march to shanghai. the final battle looms over the distance, though shanghai hasnt recruited soldiers in a while, what are they building? burned down a city full of jews cos io couldnt be bothered to have my religion compete with judaism in that city. build new city right on that spot a day after burning it down",209.8
"after playing for awhile, not only did i find this fun and challenging but also addicting because you keep telling yourself just one more turn and the next thing you know youve been playing for hours. so yeah good game and also get the complete edition if you can.",9.1
"i recommend not only the game, but the dlc as well. having so many civs to choose from, it will take hours upon hours to play as them all. for me, this makes civ v interesting and new every time i play. best dlc for a game by far.",355.7

"great game, played the original and now i even play beyond earth. civilization v is still my favorite.",167.3
"id like to start by giving you a warning: you will get addicted to this game. this game pretty much has an endless amount of outcomes when dealing with other civilizations & you will not be disappointed with this game. i highly recommended this game & i also recommend getting the dlcs for this game. but, a fair warning, (again): with the dlc brave new world, it is a bit tricky to understand at the beginning. it does big a bit of a new diplomatic system to the game, but it is a great improvement over the old one, (which is still a good one too).",416.6
"civ v is a great turn based strategy game which lets you take history and make it submit to you as the master of all history and other boshtets. in all seriousness, the best part is being able to bomb poor s who still use crossbows and swords and crap. id reccomend this game to turn based strategy fans and people who really like seeing rome become a world power and stuff.",127.1
"it was a interesting and creative game. it had limited resources that made it more of a challenge but gives you a reason to expand to other regions. the idea and story behind the game is truely a recipe for fun and creativity. i have payed these games before on other systems and inever get tired of all the things i can complete and do on civilization.",3.6
"very cool strategy. i advise everyone who likes to reflect and build your own empire",12.9
"this game is just awsome! civv worths every cent that youll spend with it. the strategy is complex at the same time its easy to understand the basics -thanks friendly interface, you rock -, basically you will develop hour by hour your gameplay untill you see yourself completly in love with this game. the fact that this franchise uses the turn gaming style makes civv the best game for who just dont like the crazy speed of aoe or starcraft. ps: this is awsome to play at work, as you can minimize the window and stop playing without getting killed or losing smtg. my recommendation about civv?: -why are you still reading this and isnt playing the game? hahaha",161.2
"if you have time... this game is great! i have played it over a break and spent all of my time on it. it is really fun and draws you in. again, it is time consuming.",36.5

"a fun timbased gamee about ruling empieres deffintly worth my money",39.3
"although i do not play it as much as i did, i still think that this is one of my favourite games of all time. it is great to play against the a.i. and even better to play people online, (although some people take it a bit too seriously). pros: - easy controls - large variations in civilizations available - simple display (of data and map) - option for normal and strategic display - fair and balanced gameplay - fun to play, even after long games - very customizable options (in-game) - a.i. is balanced: in difficulty and in gameplay cons: - long games can sometimes grow tedious - some civilizations are better at everything than others [this may be unavoidable: to have weak civs and more powerful civs] - occasional texture glitches; but i think thats just me all and all, i think this is a brilliant game, and would most definately recommend it to people who enjoy strategy games.",234.2
"yes!!! this game is truly amazing! in true civilization fashion this is one of the best,only if you have the dlc. they basically took what made civ 4 good and took a couple of things out going oh we dont need this lets just take this out. and then when people complained about it and went oh we took that out becasue we didnt think people would want it so if you pass us a couple of bucks you can have that stuff. what im saying is if you are going to buy thid game or any of the civilization games then wait for a complete edition or buy the dlc so the game you play is complete. im not trying to say the game is incomplete im just saying that if you want a full experiance then get the dlc.",20.6

"this is the strategy game ive waited for a long time. challlenging concepts but easy to master controls makes you feel like you hold the civilization in your hand. best of all is that multiplayer with friends and players is even more exciting by adding a whole other level of depth and mystery to the game. for anyone interested in strategy or military games this game is an essential for your personal game collection. happy gaming!",90.1

"i have mixed feelings for this game. its great fun but it feels a bit naked without the dlc. multiplayer is where this game shines in my opinion the only trouble with this is that multiplayer is broken... very broken... it seems the developers got half way though and called it a day before they published it. youll be lucky to stay in a multiplayer server without having it backtrack or just stop working fullstop. id reccomend buying this and the addons when it comes on sale. otherwise just give it a miss.",85.3

"great game well built even if the sequel has come out this game has its perks",351.2
"from the bit of the game ive played, its a really fun strategy game that i actually enjoyed, which says a lot, as im not a huge fan of the genre. the game genuinely feels quite rewarding when you unlock new things and take over other civilizations. i cant say much about multiplayer yet, but i imagine it would be very fun. overall, i definitely recommend this game to anyone.",42.9
"i absolutely love playing civilization v. ive never played any of the previous civs before, but my husband has always been a fan and got me into the game as well. im also not much of a gamer, so to me, the graphics are great for the functionality of playing. the music is beautifully done and the personalities of each civ mostly mirrors actual history. its fun, and the civlopedia helps me learn a little bit about each culture. this is a fun and captivating game.",83.7

"the game was disapointing because it was not as good as civ 4 (or any of the previous civ games) out of the box so i recommend you buy any of those instead. the problem is that the base game is incomplete and dull. essentially it is civ 1 with fancy graphics but without the coolest feature (being able to build a palace if your people love you). the dlcs which may restore some of the features of civ 4 should have formed part of general patching so i refuse to buy them since they are also stupidly expensive for what they appear to offer. i uninstalled it afte a few days and if i ever feel like a bout of world domination i dig out my copy of civ 4 over this.",72.6

"the hexagonal layout and new city defense system refreshes the gameplay and fixes the absurd unit stacking of civ iv. though its not as deep and diverse as civ iv. online mode is bugged and nearly impossible to enjoy which is a major downside. many balance issues and some bugs are fixed via the civilization v unofficial patch (civup) and vanilla enhanced mod (vem). overall its worth giving it a try as there is a demo on steam. its not the successor everybody was waiting for but its a step into the right direction.",24.4

"it took me a while to get used to the whole turn based thing, but now i realize that its addicting as hell and therefore great for the developers, so thumbs up for that. unlike other strategy games ive tried its not that much to organize and gather, which makes it easier to focus on the strategy/occupying land/backstabbing/building armies part  and i guess that deserves a thumbs up as well. and as others already pointed out: beware of gandhi.",32.4
"just one more turn....... if you havent ever played any of the civilization series, then i must recommend you get one of them some time soon. they may seem complicated at first, but with many different ways to win using different strategies, short or long games, different map types, good dlc, many different civs to choose from etc, it is really rewarding in the long run. civilization iv is pretty damn good too. enjoy",520.0
"very good strategy with loads of fun ;) however i need to warn that: - next turn button is bugged; 50% of cases it doesnt do anything, 40% it shows some unit which needs new orders and only at remaining 10% it trully ends turn, - workers forget what they were doing almost every single turn, - game starts up and loads save very slow. other than that its really cool and you probably wont regret buying it ;)",35.2

"one of my favorite games of all time. you can literally spend 6 hours straight playing this game. one more turn is what the game is all about. the dlc also makes the game a lot more fun, and there are a lot of cool mods out there if you find the game becomes a bit bland over time.",218.0
"civilization v is in my opinion the best turn-based empire building game to date. with over 20 civ with their own unique units, buildings and perks you will not be running out of a new strategy to try anytime soon. although i do recommend picking up the two expansion packs gods and kings and brave new world.",92.4

"although i do not play it as much as i did, i still think that this is one of my favourite games of all time. it is great to play against the a.i. and even better to play people online, (although some people take it a bit too seriously). pros: - easy controls - large variations in civilizations available - simple display (of data and map) - option for normal and strategic display - fair and balanced gameplay - fun to play, even after long games - very customizable options (in-game) - a.i. is balanced: in difficulty and in gameplay cons: - long games can sometimes grow tedious - some civilizations are better at everything than others [this may be unavoidable: to have weak civs and more powerful civs] - occasional texture glitches; but i think thats just me all and all, i think this is a brilliant game, and would most definately recommend it to people who enjoy strategy games.",234.2

"back in 1991, a little game called civilization was released. it was a pretty awesome game, everything was perfect. except for gandhi. gandhi was given the lowest possible rating for aggression, he wouldnt hurt a fly. however, when a civilization adopted democracy, it would set back all other civs aggression levels by 2. this meant gandhi was set to -1, which flung him all the way back to the highest rating - 255. its been a running joke ever since. since then gandhi has conquered many civs taken over many planets and made many nukes. #neverforget.",75.7
"i love this iteration of civ. i bought the gold pack with extra civs and maps. it has enough depth to keep you coming back again and again. but its simple enough for anyone to get started and play. i like having control over the advanced setup and choosing or limiting modes of victory to change things up. i play civ5 many times more than my other games. you can choose to make the games quick or mathons. either way you can always sit down for a few turns when you have the time, and save the rest for later. this is a very versatile game setup that allows you to customize almost anything. whether you are new to civ, or a domination monster, i highly recommend this game.",607.9

"as soon as i downloaded this game it turned out my computer couldnt run it. looking back at the reviews i want to tell my computer to clean its **** up and run because ghandi needs a beat down. im pretty sure sid meier knew everyone would trust ghandi so he made him a sadistic nuclear frenzied psycho. i must play this game.",89.3
"good game. however, im not really much of a fan of the civ series. i still much prefer the eu or tw series. its a blast to play with friends though and the ai is pretty good too.",4.5

"ive only played for a few hours. its pretty meh. probably wont replay too often.",168.6
"the epitamy of the turn based grand strategy game. civ has always been just deep in enough in turn based strategy gameplay mechanics to entrap both hardcore turn based gamer as well as the less hardcore amongst us. civilization is a series i will always pay attention to, and is one of those games that i keep coming back to in its latest form, right up until the next one is released. cheers!",191.7

"very easy to get invested into this game. put on a movie, or season of a tv show and play this on the side and time will fly. after winning a couple times on easy and losing a couple times on hard its fun to transpher over to online multiplayer where you can play with your mates from class.",124.3
"well, there goes hours of my life that i could have spent doing something useful. jk it was totally worth it! i like watching the comps try to make peace treaties with me as i walk over their countries with giant death robots! now all i need to do is get the futuristic one, whatever its called :. 10/10 would kill city-states again.",242.9

"play any games that do not involve steam ae the best to spend money on. steam is crap and sucks. the valve or value company that ownes steam is managed by a s s h o le s and r e t a r d s that could not find their a s s with both hands and a map unless they were looking for their money wallet. fix your problems. if you dont know what they are just ask us gamers. we know and will tell you where improvements are needed.",483.2
"love it! really great game. i recomment it to anyone who likes strategie games.",44.2
"ive only played for about 2,450 hours, but even from that one match, i can tell this is an amazing strategy game. from the first annoying barbarian raids, to the last annoying ghandi nukes, youll be on the edge of your seat asking questions like, i wonder what my family look like? and how old am i now? truly a stunning gaming experience. too much water. 7.8/10",97.0

"so much replay value ... even if you dont replay it, you easily can spend more than a dozen hours on a single game.",91.5
"an incredibly robust game with a lot of depth and fun. although it can get a bit samey through multiple plays there enough settings and styles to keep it interesting. worth a play for those looking for some long turn-based strategy.",49.3
"impossible to play just one more turn - amazing game.",73.0
"this game is loads of fun. the multiplayer is a blast, and the gameplay can be challenging. many different playable factions, each with different quirks, strengths, and weaknesses, give the game a high replay value. even if you have a sure-fire strategy for one civ (and even that probably wont work every time), it isnt likely to work as another civ. even if the regular gameplay bores you, there are scenarios and mods than can freshen up the gameplay. however, as a turn-based grand strategy/4x game, graphics arent its strongest point. while theyre nothing as stunning as some of the games out today, theyre still good, and the game wont be hard on the eyes by a long shot.",181.3
"all the years of playing civ and i still enjoy this game more than i should....",179.3
"great game i cant wait to put more hours into it. 5/5 maybe?",80.3

"this game is awesome, and on sale for the next couple days, its definitely worth your money.",299.9

"always a great game to play to pass time and conquor the world!",101.0
"very good for strategy lovers and generally a re.ally fun game",27.3
"before i started playing, i pictured this game as being kinda like rts games ive played like age of empires. this is more turn-based and strategic than other games, with an emphasis towards building up over a long period of time. and yeah, i mean looooong. games can get fairly lengthy, though its pretty easy to put them on pause, even in multiplayer. theres definitely a learning curve, and while the tutorials are adequate for the basics, theres a lot of nitty gritty stuff that trips you up the first few games. overall, this is a great game for turn-based strategy, with lots of replayability, especially if you can get a couple of friends to join you for a long evening session.",92.3
"i come from tons of hours on civilization iii and i was a little sospicious about this one... but i was wrong. this game balanced, tough and have a lot of new cool stuff. worth it.",91.2

"you can denounce your friends. 10/10 would denounce again.",104.6

"one of the most addictive games. tough its more than 4 years old, it can still give you a great time!",169.5
"game is absolutely amazing and continues to evolve due to steamworks support.",266.9
"its a very fun and strategic game good for people who like strategy beacuse thats the main focus of the game",65.5
"ok, even the base game by itself is to fun, now add dlc to mix this game is gold if your a strategic thinker!",38.6
"10/10 civ 5 is an addictive game of strategy... psshhh i really dont know much about games. but this one is really fun. its challenging, and there are so many different ways to win (although nothing really beats just killing everyone else off). if you feel like dominating the world, this is the game for you :)",115.6
"one of my favorite games of all times, it can be equally realistic and ridiculous and is a definite must buy! i have become a little obsessed with the game and i have hundreds of hours of playtime and have still only scratched the surface of what i can do, and what civs i can play as. you can spend hours developing strategies and plans for the ultimate empire, or just dont give a care and nuke everybody. in my time in civ i have been able to: -take over the world as the might warlord ghandi -get my butt kicked by siam within 20 turns -watch the babylonians burn after they dared to defile me -say that ill only play for 2 more turns and end up playing another 200",780.4

"just doing this for a badge. though is a good game",100.7
"if you want to occupy yourself for days unend,then this is for you. it has a huge collection of things on the workshop, countless different ways to play, too. 9/10 would recommend.",129.1
"really solid game with the dlc. it may cost more but its worth it. pick it up during a steam sale to maximize value.",225.7

"i great game. i love how many ways there are to win and how you can pick what speed you want to play at. highly recommended.",23.3
"this is a great game! not as great as it used to be in version 2... but there is nothing even near it. if you enjoy a good thinking startegy - this is a must. the best game ever - you know ;-)",326.1
"the game always seems to have some kind of an issue when playing online, but is a great game for anyone that likes stratagy games.",63.1
"get the game if you like this type of game because it is fantastic",29.3
"this is one of those special games that eat up time. having been a huge fan of civ iv, civ v feels like a fresh update.",69.8
"fun stratergy game to play! would definetly recommend to a group of players :d",16.3
"civilization v is an expansive and interesting game with great detail and political strategy. as i can attest, it is relatively easy to learn but difficult to master if you are new to the genre or the series. i eagerly await the release of beyond earth, as this game has given me a great introduction to strategy games and the civilization series. p.s. you should definately check out the steam workshop mods, they give the game a whole second life.",72.9
"very good game imo. i once settled my civ where i spawned on the world map setting (the united states). i was playing as arabia, so theyre islamic..................yea...............anyway, mecca and medina were in southern california and baghdad was where dallas would be. to you hardcore, bible thumping, everythings bigger in texas { except the members :) } texans, ill give you a moment to let that sink in. to any others this game should be mucho divertido (very fun). p.s. hit next turn",102.0
"with almost 200 hours on record, i can say this is one of my favorite games to play. i made sure to have all my friends buy it so we could enjoy another beautiful, and sometimes very very competitive and intense, game together. while it didnt quite get stale, it just sometimes felt a little repetitive. then i discovered the dlcs for civ 5 and my loe began again. now to begin my next 100 hours of creating memorys to last me forever! amazing game!!",181.2
"unlike any game ive ever owned, and offers hours of engaging gameplay. this game is a time consumer, but i promise its worth the time. i suggest finding a couple of friends and play together online, its a great way to bond.",151.9
"ive never seen a game that is so good at coming up with stupid ways to completely screw you over, no matter what you do, something will spawn or appear or disappear and you will be screwed, every time, without fail",545.6
"not much more to be said on the subject, but this game is great. my wife and i love playing together and we have put more hours into this than any other game in our steam lists. brave new world is a great addition to the already great core game.",139.3

"one of the best game i goten off steam so far. totaly worth it",25.8
"civ 5 is so addicting! its hard for me to pull myself away from this game even after 5-6 hours of non-stop playing. i enjoy playing with my friend as well, we conquer as a team and even seperately. its very interesting to see how your civilization can progress. i havent gotten far down the tech tree yet, im actually hoping to do a more relaxed game, less war, so i can experience the progress of the eras. i do not really have anything bad to say about this game. i do wish one thing could be tweaked and thats a barbarian slider to say how often they appear or something. thats all. i love this game and highly, highly recommend playing it over beyond earth -.-",42.0
"addictive. very addictive. i try playing nice. i just want most/all the good resoures and to expand my empire(s). 10/10",226.9

"this game destroyed my sleeping schedule....... but within the same day, it fixed my sleeping schedule. 24/10 would destroy and fix my sleeping schedule again!",216.2
"i actually felt embaressed to play this game online for a very good reason. the hours...the amount of hours to can waste playing this game is ridiculous, i swear when i first played the game, it was around 7pm, when i finally gave up on the match, it was around 7am. so i thought it was better for my reputation to play it offline to prevent my account from telling the world of my approx  hrs playing this game. this game may not look it but it is an incredibly good time waster and after putting a lot of work into a match, you want to commit to finishing the match and winning it. i wouldnt want to recommend this game to others as when you finally finish playing this game, you might find yourself with grey hair and aging bones at the approximate age of 80? but overall it is a great stratagy game with a lot of mods which make the game eveb bigger.",37.0
"it think it helps if you have someone who can help you with this game in the early stages, as it takes a while to remember what each of the things on screen actually does, but id definitely reccomend it. lots of options as to what you can do once youve got past the early stages.",18.4
"really enjoyable but takes hours - days or longer to play would definitely recommend.",32.6
"a very good game with endless possibilities as loads of countries.",115.3
"i bought this game on offer with all dlc and i have to say, it is a very good game. the gameplay is very addicting and you always want to complete just one more turn. there is progression, so you can be bad at the game and still really enjoy it. the features seem quite balanced and are fair on players. you can play it however you want, with other victories than just killing everyone. plus, it even runs lag-free on my non-gaming laptop. overall, i do very much recommend.",18.7
"played this game awhile back during its free trial. very fun when you need a couple hours to kill. if i get the extra cash i may think about getting it. still too pricy for me right now though.",280.7
"when i discovered the mods, since then i only play the msf-nation civ/civ would play another turn",168.2
"sid meier was sitting in his office one day soon after civ 4 was released and decided you know waht im gonna make civ5 as  as possible and then we got this turd. and then he was like im gonna make some expansions to make it better and then the end result is call of duty modern warfare 5 except its a 4x game",29.1
"played game for an hour however feels like a dumbed down version of the old civ that i have played over the years, so have gone back to civ 4.",4.6
"a brilliant strategy game. fighting opponents that act correctly to your actions. fighting real situations such as poverty, starvation etc. my favorite game of the civilization series. great work!",75.7
"ive played a little bit of the game and get what the game is about. with the time ive played ive experienced victory and total defeat. the game has great features and awesome gameplay, but with only one downside. if you some much as  off another civ a little bit. they will want nothing more but to kill you and turn your allies against you. but that kinda just adds to the gameplay i suppose. but this game is great to play with friends, you can team up and take out everyone else, or be that one  and be all warlord like ( totally me ). but overall it is a great game, and even better with friends. hope this review helped in some way.",43.4
"this game is very strateigic and cool, there are many countries to use and lots of things to do.",153.7
"the first time i played this, i thought it was extremely boring. a turn based strategy game? come on. ive always played other games such as starcraft for my rts fix because of the speed at which you play. but after coming back and forcing myself to sit down and play it, i found that while the games do go for a long time and i do like a quick win, this game is really good and really detailed. a single match on the smaller maps can take a couple of hours on their own but theres so much you can do that the game feels fresh at every step along the way. i make sure to turn off combat animations and movement animations though, just to make it that slight bit faster.",25.9
"been playing since civ 2, this game will ruin your life. you can live out your maniacal ambitions to conquer the world in a game, especially if you come from a formerly-great-now-irrelevant-country. 10/10",972.5
"definetly finer graphics then 4 and alot more interesting options plays slightyl differently but gods and kings is a fine addition",1.8

"america was the founder of the shinto religion. 11/10 would get annexed by native americans again.",68.9

"fiance no longer allows me to play this as i get to involved in it. 10/10",23.6
"this game was amazing, i played it when i did not have much to do on certain day, even vanilla was very fullfilling and exciting. though it has bugs and its hard to run on older pc, it is still a blast with the amazing soundtrack the top notch strategy gameplay and its overall ability to be a game.",182.7
"if youre looking for a game that will make you think, strategize, and adapt, youve found it. civilization 5 is easily one of the best strategy games ive ever played, and it never seems to get old. no two sessions are alike, especially if you choose to play multiplayer. the game is already fun and immersive, but when playing with a friend or two, whether youre progressing together, or fighting for superiority, the entertainment value doubles. if you enjoy turn based strategy games, give this a try; it has unlimited replayability, and i guarantee youll enjoy it. also you can nuke stuff. buy it.",101.4
"ive had a lof of fun with the game so far, although id be happier if factions had more than one choice of ruler and the introductions didnt take so long. still, if youve got a few hundred hours of your life that need filling, this is a pretty good choice.",221.4
"i played more then 500 hours and i still dont know what i think of this game...",422.7
"this game is ubelieveable. so incredibly addicting and aparently ghandi isnt a friend but more like a traitor and backstabbing tyrant. hahaha, who would of thought...anyway without this game i wouldnt have gotten into pc gaming and strategy games in general. definately 11/10 skittles to this game!",67.6
"love playing civilization 5 - both as a stand alone as well as multiplayer, there are many ways to win and its historical accuracy is great. i just wish the actual developers made original earth maps and have original start locations. such as africa scenarios and europe scenarios built into the game. also have scenarios that enable multiplayer functionality. still a great game. being playing franchise since civ 1. well done sid meier.",405.5
"one of the best games to lose the day in, build your empire today :d",866.6
"this is officially one of my most favorite games i play all the time i recently got the expansions, but before that i played vanilla civ 5 as well, with the dlc there is alot more you can do but without it it is still really fun! i give this game on a scale of 0-100 a 120!",240.1
"it is a good game, yes, but to be very enjoyable and to have any mentionable replay value, you need all of the expansions. dont forget to grab them as well. it goes on sale often, so keep an eye out. it is definitely a fantastic game if you enjoy real-time strategy, and i highly recommend it.",159.5
"a great game even without the dlcs but you are unable to upgrade to the compleat edition once you have bought the base game, this needs fixing as you used to be able to upgread to the gold edition.",96.8

"i love sid meiers civilization v. im a longtime civization and sims nut, so im biased but really. its so worth it and better with friends than an ai! the multiplayer is really well structured and works out really well for an overall fun test of strategic might! x3",122.7
"civilization 5 is a game in where you, the player, control an entire nation. what they didnt tell you is that a barbarian can kill a huge god damn tank. 1000000/10",65.7
"of the 44.3 hours that ive played this game in the last two weeks, 44.3 of them were over the course of the past two days. i think that says something about the quality of this game. or just my mental condition. whatever, you should get it. trust me on this.",169.4
"fun turn based strategy game although slows down as you progress so best played with a fast processor.",757.2
"i played this game for 50 hours in the first three days of owning it. it is one of those games where once you get a basic grasp on gameplay you play a lot, then you start ignoring your friends and girlfriend, and in the end you stop eating until someone comes into your room two days later to find out if you are alive or not...so i highly recommend this game!",194.9
"it is an excellent game; many improvements on civ iv. the new mechanics of war make it far less hacky without unit stacking, and the added differentiation between civilizations works much better than the minor differences in civ iv.",494.9
"this game is very fun. it has alot of ways to play the games and alot of ways to win. but the game is funnest when you have all of the dlc. you should definitly get this game if you like strategy.",1068.4
"if you enjoyed civ iv, youll enjoy this game. heck, if you enjoy any kind of strategy game, youll like civ v. for all those who have played civ iv, a lot of the same awesomeness has returned, if not a bit dumbed down, but youll still enjoy every aspect of it. i do recommend purchasing both of the major dlc for it, as they add a lot of content that is well worth the extra price. the game is very easy to get the hang of, and it is easy to lose a few hours thinking, one... more... turn. 100% recommend!",152.8
"nukes with gandhi and eldorado. destroy the mongolians for stealing your fountain of youth!",618.2
"this is one of the best games i have ever played. it is surely worth the money. if you are considering between this, and say, call of duty, buy this. it is 100x better and is a lot more fun to lay. it is a game that will not get boring. so much variety in the game. you could choose between about 45 different nations and try to win in different ways. all in all, i highly recommend this game to people who looked to have fun playing by themselves or with a group of friends.",498.7
"thios  is addicting, i spent so much time on this, i sucked  in a parking lot for bnw",532.4

"i know theres been a lot of whining about this version of civ, but frankly it has given me dozens of hours of gameplay and all of them fun. i cant ask for much more from a game. actually, fun fact: i bought it at launch as a physical copy, saw it was a steam game when i opened it, and as such it was my first steam game.",87.5
"good fun, though it does make a macbook air try to take off when playing against the ai (fans go nuts to keep the cpu cool). so easy to lose half a day to the game because of the just one more turn nature.",99.4
"its basically the classic 4k game revamped! graphics, gameplay, and the feel that youre actually running an empire. thats a true experience that civilization v can give. i also recommend both gods and kings as well as the brave new world expansion. :)",79.3
"any game i can play for 200 hours without getting bored is worth any price and i got it on sale with all the add ons for total of $40. thats $0.20 an hour for an incredible time. the expansions just added even more incredible change and complexity to the gameplay. it really is an incredible game and everyone should invest, especially given how often this game goes on sale. easy to play, near impossible to master, but fun at any level. 9.5/10, the only reason theres that .5 off is because the mu;tiplayer can be a bit laggy. but with smaller maps this shouldnt be an issue.",207.4
"this game is amazing loads of fun and if you have all the expancions/dlcs your in for a even bigger blast just get the game i think you will find yourself playing it for hours",6.0
"this game is incredibly good. i came into it thinking i might play it few times... but found myself playing until my parents got up to go to work... (thank god it was durring the winter break and that i wasnt working the morning shifts) if you want to waste your life while being educated about historical events and leaders, this is a must buy! i hope you enjoy this strategic game as much as i do/did.",80.8
"this game is awesome!!! fantastic graphics, mechanics games and very complex.civilization have very much leaders are more attractive gameplay.diplomatic and spy is great! and strategic war is very intresting.nothing only playing days and nights :d",143.3
"dont lie to yourself and realize your dream of being the world dominator with this game!",6.0
"this game is great with both expansions. i do like it but it does have drwbacks. 1. the ai is still . it doesnt always develope land and seems militarily stupid at times. and 2. the difficulty setting work by making the ai cheat: it adds food gold and culture to every ai city. this means that an ai city can have 13 pop and a huge influence area while surounded by jungle with no improvements on the tiles. i hope civ 6 is very different from this game. i do reccomend this. but the next iteration needs to have a very differnt a.i. and difficulty system.",201.6

"civilization v > dota 2 this game is pretty good. ive learned alot from it actually... not like hirsory and stuff. ive learned how to muster up the courage to tell a lie. no matter if youre single-player or multi-player i can promise you at one point, youre going to warm up to some civ and youre gonna get all buddy-buddy, and then youre gonna stick a big fat nuke in a plane, and youre gonna invite him to a party... and youre gonna drop bombs, not beats. 10/10 nuked the heck out of germany everytime.",175.7
"this game is an  plasmated into code. i never truly liked this genre of gaming, but this game changed my mind completely on it. it gives the player a lot of freedom on how he wants to play and getting things done is quick and easy. the game makes you think hard before doing something, as just starting random wars with everyone may lead to a very quick game over. the only thing i can blame this game for are some online problems ive had whilst playing the game, but they arent too bad. it is perfect and it completely deserves to be in your steam library. 10/10",50.3
"a really dang good strategy game that can be really addicting. reaching end-game and trying to kill all of the opposing civilizations was always one of my favorite parts. just dont get too into the game, or youre gonna realize that youve been playing the game for a whole year.",20.8
"the civiliazation games have always been amazing....i truly think it is worth every penny. highly recommended.",223.9
"an excellent turn-based-strategy game. some mechanics are a bit weak or ill conceived (the culture system introduced in brave new world is haphazard and breaks the team-based victory conditions if youre playing with an allied player, the religion and un systems from god and kings are limited and rarely justify pursuing them); but most mechanics have been streamlined a lot from civ4 to make them far more intuitive and fun. civiv certainly has more complexity, and arguably depth; but civ5 is definitely the better game, and well worth getting.",185.7

"one of the best strategy games i have never played, and here is why. 1. pick your own civilization from about 12 diffrent civilization. 2. is your play style peacefull, merchant or militarist? pick your own civilization that fits your play style. 3. nice diplomacy and trade system. (sometimes its hard to get the computer to trade with you) 4. there is random personalities option, whitch grants other civs random personalities. (if it wasnt self-evident) 5. workshop, there are tons of diffrent civs in workshop. gives the game alot re-playability. 6. nukes and xcom-squad. 7. it kicks",99.2

"one of the best strategi (turn based) game ever, and in civilization v, you can do a lot more then previous games, not only more civilizations, units, buildings, wonders but aswell new cultural victory, international trade routes, world congress, policies, ideologies, religion, diplomacy, espionage, naval combat, city states, and a lot more, what are you waiting for ? world domination by your hand is waiting... (psst, at least try the demo !) official site :",83.0

"this is by far my favorite game of all time, and with all the mods this game is endless. build your empire, build up your soldiers, take over other countries. this game has everything you need with turn base game. if you really like this game, make sure you spend some cash and get the add-ons, it makes the game even more intense.",182.4
"world domination or peaceful living. all-round raging wars or calm afternoons by inventing new technologies? you decide, but before that, you need your own civilization.",316.6
"every civ i was playing against decided to turn on me near the endgame until they found out i had enough nukes to bomb the map into oblivion. which i did. but not before turning each and every one of them away when they ran to me in order apologise and plead for peace. yall better not  with me and my giant robots 10/10 would turn nuclear heel at endgame again",39.2

"warning: this game will make time disappear. seriously how long can just one more turn take?",116.6
"this game is so much better than beyond earth! beyond earth isnt that great of a game like this one, my favourite thing about this game is that you go up in ages from a round wheel to space age, but beyond earth its all in the same age with only technological upgrades and the units you get.. well lets just say theres not a lot. prefer this game 10 out of 10 than beyond earth! well lets just wait, the game was only recently released hoefully they will put in a lot more dlc into the game to make it more fun, at least put in more units than just the basic ones. still have no idea how to use the jets yet so complicated or maybe its just glitched out because i cant make them move any where around the map or to hover/guard a tile",13.5
"great game but make sure to buy with its expansions as they improve the gameplay dramastically. definitely my favourite pc game at the moment",309.6

"if you are a fan of the civilization series, you will enjoy this game. great replay value.",245.1
"love this game! not really used to playing these types of games. however im really into this! the best thing about it is the amount of people you get in a game (wheher its ai or online players). its just means there is always something to do, be aware of and work towards. some games, you have to wait a many turns to accomplish something. in civ 5 it seems like you are constantly working towards a goal.",9.8

"the best of its title. 10/10 if you are into turn-based strategy, this is the game for you. the best turn-based strategy. build your empire. win through culture, science, diplomacy, or rule everyone dominion. the only things i dont like is that you must continue to improve your technology to the max or you wont be able to compete with other nations. i wish theres a way to max the era to medieval era for example so that you can roll with samurais or knights :)) even then, its still 10/10.",1.5
"right, so first of all if you dont like history, bloody battles, advances in technology, ancient civilizations or just cool stuff. this game isnt for you. civilization v is a history gurus dream come true, well into a game atleast. as soon as you dive into civilization v, you might not come out of your room for a few weeks, also if youre a student in school expect to see your history grade rise...",404.8

"the only thing i would change about this game is the ai. when you set the difficulty higher, your enemies do not become smarter, they just get unfair advantages. if they got smarter when the game got harder, it would be much more interesting.",387.8

"this has proven to be one of my absolute favourite games. its difficult to put my finger on exactly what is so wonderful about civ v, but i can say that it has the best replayablity value on anything ive ever played. single player is smooth and refined, and every playable civ is perfectly balanced. every map offers a reasonable challenge, and there are multiple ways to win a game. for me, civ v really gets fun in multiplayer with some friends. the multiplayer can be a little touch-and-go, but that was hugely improved in the last few patches. with pitboss multipalyer being run from a stable connection, most of the problems associated with civ vs multiplayer are circumvented. i cannot recommend this game highly enough. if youre waiting to be swayed, get this game. it offers hours upon hours of entertainment.",167.5
"easily my favorite game. i do play consol games as well, but civ keeps me coming back to the computer. all the time that i played games like age of empires 2, sim city and starcraft, this is what i was longing for. this game has everything i love, world building, empire management, military strategy, diplomacy, and much more. ive spent hours in my little microcosms building empires to stand the test of time and i plan on continuing to play it until i can play civ 6.",511.2

"very boring game. it does not have the splendorous and enjoyability of his predecessors. i do miss the time when games were more than graphics or animation, those who played civilization 2, for example, may be able to understand it. the advisors were real animations, there were videos for the wonders and so on... okay, what you did not have on graphics you had on creativity. i really miss these times, sierra and all.",16.6

"theres a debate thats been going on since this game was first released years ago, whether or not civ iv or v is better. to be honest before the expansions came out for this game, i wouldve told you that iv was better, but not anymore. yes it is way simpler to play than iv and yes there are weird mechanics, like unhappiness when your kingdom gets too big, but overall it seems more seemless and immersive. no more are the days of a massively stacked army descending on each enemy city in turn, no, now you have to have a semblence of strategy. to me thats more enjoyable. if youre looking for a decent strategy game to waste away the afternoon with, look no further, this game is more than enough to get you through the weekend, let alone the afternoon!",192.7

"while i have never played any other civilization games this one takes the cake if only for its easy learning curve to get into it. having spent dozens of hours playing this the best thing the game has going for it is the infinate replayability and great multiplayer. i would suggest this game to anyone who loves games like total war or other strategy games.",187.6
"great game, good graphics. you controll a civilization and there is a lot of them you can choose between. the gods and kings dlc and brave new world add a lot to the game. before brave new world the ai was to aggresive, now they arent aggresive at all or well some specific civilizations ai are but not many. if you buy this game, buy it with the dlc also it makes the game 100% better. i also recommend getting the mods city limit and reseed they are usefull but can only be used when playing mod. ill probably give this game a 9/10, it still has some issues but its a really good game.",169.2
"a very addicting game to say the least. if you need a time sink, look no further then civilization 5. if you are new, or a veteran to civ. civ 5 was created to draw new people into the franchise because it was stagnating. the game does just that. it has enough tactical depth to keep anyone entertained, and is simple enough to jump right into on the lower difficultys. i strongly reccomend this game if you want to loose and social life you may have. ;p",110.2
"what the  dude its like crack cocaine you lose your life playing this  if it wasnt clear i love this game",118.2
"while the initial launch was rocky and multiplayer was a joke, they have since resolved most of my gripes with civ5. it is a fresh and streamlined approach to the old system, and while it is not necessarily better than civ4, it provides a much more interesting (imho) tactical experience while eliminating a lot of the micromanagement that tended to bog down previous titles in the series. worth getting on sale.",321.5
"the first strategy game that ive enjoyed -hanwen co. 2013",50.4
"this is pretty much the only 4x game i can truly get in to. i have never played a more immersive and rewarding strategy/simulation game before this. only one quibble, though. why do barbarian tribes still spawn in the 1800s and up?!",30.8
"spend hours massing armies of tanks before the ai is out of the stone age.",185.2
"i was a little hesitant to play this at first as this isnt the type of game i usually pick up, but if anyone watches angry joe show, he wasnt lying. this game is amazing. ive invested 24+ hrs into it and am still in love with it. my only comment would be that as a girl, i do enjoy playing female characters and theyve included a handful but theres still a clearly disproportionate number of male characters. alas, this is likely due to the overwhelming amount of male leaders compared to female leaders in our history, but lets not get political. anyway, buy this game.",103.3
"probably the most addicting/fun game i have ever played. if you buy it get all the dlc it makes the game a lot more complete.",775.8
"awesome game, you can be a warlord and take over everything or you can be a pasifist and have friendship with all but a few. you choose, but will you choose well?",679.2
"you play an immortal warlord in control of your units, pretty fun and time consuming",100.0
"this game is the epitome of turn-based strategy. since its release, there have been so many major improvements across the board. dlcs, multiplayer fixes (multiplayer is basically 100% different than when it first came out, and thats a good thing), amongst other things. i cant say enough good things about this game. my only beef with it? when i pick random leader and it gives me venice.  venice. anyways, get this game, and dont choose venice as your civ. one of the best games in history.",558.8

"if you love turn based strategy games, or have yet to try one, i highly suggest civ v. its the most refined in the long standing series and will take away your social life, and what could be better than that? x)",63.2
"i wish i could add more npc players to the game without it actually making it harder for me to win. whats the default for a normal-sized map? like, six players? well, on the right difficulty setting, thats a fun challenge; not too easy, and not to frustratingly difficult like it could be if there were more players to complete world wonders before me and things like that. having more civilizations in one game makes it seem deeper and more varied, though! it adds flavor. i wish i could add, like... secondary civilizations, (from the full list, not just city-states, because city-states are boringly two-dimensional), but just have them kind of suck, so that im only playing against like five or so empires that are actually challenging to overcome. is that a strange request?",387.4

"10/10 this game is so cool. i would get it if it was on sale or not it is so good",28.6
"tons of fun, if you have any thoughts on if you should get it or not, get it. it will engulf those meaningless hours that you used to use for doing productive things. great game all in alll, i would recommend purchasing the gold edition. 9/10",194.8
"this game ultimatly makes you realize what it is like to manage a country in a dynamically changing world. the gameplay options available and how they are used really need forthought to be played effectivley. a great stratergy game.",201.8
"the only civilization game ive played before i played civilization v was civ.exe aka civilization. like, the first one. that is how old school i am. but enough about me, this is about civilization v. the first thing that hit me about civilization v (after figuring out how to prevent it from crashing during the intro video, that is) was how crappy the graphics are. everything is like little men and cities and vehicles that stuff. thats disgusting. civilization had little squares for everything (except planes - they were circles). cities were squares, men were squares, tanks, boats, catapults, missiles. everything was squares and that is how it should be. but its ok because civilization v has this strategic view that makes everything squares like they should be. once i found that setting i was able to enjoy the rest of this games bugs in style.",292.2
"i dont know how, but i have seen more sunrises playing this game than any other.",99.6
"i always wonder why i ever played this game. then, i realized that it is played en masse because that is the games nature- to have you waste an entire day trying to better ais in a cpu generated world. is this my reason, i cannot say. but i can say that it is worth a hundred hours of gameplay.",210.9

"im sorry to say that a did not like this game at all. compared to the empire games it is very childish and slow. building armies and cities and improving an economy takes hours. it is difficult to get into.",1.7
"words cannot describe how much fun can be had in just one game. you can co-op, compete, or fly solo. and lets not forget the mods you can find on workshop! i personally love sitting here leading my armies to either forcefully or peacefully take over the world! oh gosh and lets not forget the dlc that adds religious boundaries and world meetings. its just a really great game, even though the only comparison i personally have is civ rev on xbox 360, i enjoy it thoroughly.",93.6

"you can make a giant death robot and kill an opponents bowmen. 10/10 would make friends rage again.",100.0
"i didnt get a chance to play this game a lot. but from what i did play, i really liked it. this game really sucks you in, youll be sitting on your butt for 5 hours trying to win a game that will last days. the weird thing is, while sometimes you will just want the game to end and you will just want to win, other times you will want it to last as long as possible so you can unlock every technology or take over every last tile. its good, and very addicting.",37.7
"get the expansions. several sales (years) later i finally manage to get civ5 and the expansions for the cost of what would of been the original game and i can now finally start racking up the hours. an awesome game stripped bare on release.",13.6

"the first civ game i ever played, civilization v just completely impressed me in every way. the game has that just one more turn addictiveness and is very rich in gameplay. i highly recommed to those who like civ games.",224.4

"mmmm reminds me of risk but super detailed and on the computer!!! got to love old school turn based strategy games!",91.9
"when i first got my hands on sid meiers civilization v, my life became a fight. i dont mean i was struggling to guide my civilisation to global renown, languidly picking my way up the research tree, sending little men to die in little wars. it wasnt that kind of fight. i mean i was fighting not to click the icon that led to the game that led without fail or mercy to me entering a kind of strategy fugue, which id emerge from, hungry and dehydrated, between three and seven hours later. to say this game is addictive is like saying that dry toast is edible. of course it is.",41.6
"this game is brilliant. the problem with turn based games is that they can get a bit dull if done poorly. civ 5 does a great job, really only with bnw (brave new world), which is not a point in its favor. however even without bnw this game has enough tension in combat to keep me hooked.",492.3
"civilzation is one of the world reknown strategy games that have come a long way since their first civilization. civ v is by far the best strategy i have played and am impressed by how far the game has come since its first release civ i. if youre looking for a challeng involving strategy, tactics, economics and combat then this is the game for you!",201.3
"sid meiers civilization v is a great game filled with hours apon hours of entertainment. civ v is a turn baised strategy game, it involves skill, knowlage and commitment its also a great game to play with friends. some of my favorite things about this game is the strategy behind it and the mods made by the community. i would also recommend the dlc for this game, the dlc adds a lot of fixes and new mechanics. enjoy - millerman",220.8
"this game... so addicting, you lose track of the time and its only after youve finished the great fun of it that you realise its been 6 hours. definitely recommended.",245.7

"a very fun game! reccommended for people with patience and is willing to wait a few minutes to get started. multiplayer is fun because you are up against real people! enjoyable for the whole family! going up agaist friends is fun and i reccommend it to everyone! ---what happened to me-------- i was a small civilization and then a war started and i claimed around the enemy and they fired a nuke at one of my cities! so i fired 3 nukes at each of their citys and invaded!",144.4
"america adopted fascism, france created judaism, denmark built the great wall of china, communism was voted as the world ideology, the first olympic games were held in poland, the celtic finished the the manhattan project and a native american tribe became the superpower... 10/10 would recommend this game.",368.1
"of all the games that have sucked the most time out of my life id have to say civ is one step below simcity which is one step below tetris which is one step below the game, finial fantasy. this version is a little easier than the last and they took away stacked units.",157.0
"great game, first game i got, and i love it! i have over 360 hours on it and plan to keep gaining hours.",419.7
"100% addictive. you keep telling yourself one more turn, just one more turn... and then you realise it has been three hour since you said that. oops. if you like strategy based games, turn-based games, or even just want to relax with a conquest game, this is completely and totally worth it.",68.1

"i absolutely love this game. being in highshool makes it kinda rough to play long multi-hour game. i picked up this game in mid november and i have managed to rack up almost 40 hours so far. i wasnt sure if i would like it before i bought it; after all, i had never played any turn based strategy games. however, after playing it, i have fallen in love with it. i have but one gripe, and that is that it is most enjoyable with all of the dlc. the cheapest way to get all of the dlc is in the complete edition, so it would be wise for someone who doesnt want to drop $50 on a single to buy it when it is on sale. price complaints aside, this is probable one of my favorite games.",40.0
"if you like turn-based strategy, you need this game like you need air. if you arent sure what a turn based strategy game is or if you like one, youll likely still find this game pretty awesome.",321.7
"a very fun and easily recommended game. sid meiers civilization v is a game sorta like age of empires where you build up a colony and then fight. the replay ability is awesome but there is something you must know. this game can get tedious. one game took me 2 days to complete. it was lots of fun while playing but i had to do tons of upgrades. it is really fun though and i recommend playing with your friends. 8/10!",2.7
"i had to purchase the game 2 times in order to make it work properly with the dlc but i guess thats steam? who knows... been through hell for this but the game is good",55.8
"great way to kill time and a great place for thinking. also great that i can play online with my best friend who lives far away. love the graphics!",18.2
"i havent played that much compared to others, but i still find it an amazing game. i could play this game for hours and hours, theres just something about it thats so addictive. if you havent played it, id definitely reccomend it, its a game that you wont be dissapointed by and the dlcs just make it even better.",72.2
"this has been one of my favorite games ive played and has been incredibly addiciting. the amount of detail and work that went into this game is extraordinary. while i did play civilization iv before, this game seemed entirely new and revamped. it is somewhat dificult to learn because of its complexity but once learned is a very entrenching and enjoyable game. my one complaint would be some issues with the ai in that there are many times in which units forget what they were automated to do. very fun game, nontheless.",113.6
"i love this game. for a not-so-avid civilization player, this was a great start. some civ iv players will argue about the quality of this game, but if youre new to the franchise, its definitely worth a try.",131.7
"a very strategic-based, turn-based war game... lots of different choices and ways to build your cities and armies, as well as allying with or seiging city-states and lots more too.",124.3
"playing this game for about three months or so, i figured out the possiblities of discovering new worlds, fighting civilizations, and using extraordinary mods to play the game appeal to me. however, i find the game very time consuming, as one would have to move their units one by one and especially the processing time is long. overall, i find this game interesting, creative, and enjoyable. 4/5",233.3
"besides my constant crashing its a pretty fun game",55.6
"get your kids to play it once 7+ (ish). great tool for education as well as bringing me years of fun!",106.9

"so i bought this game when it was on sale for 9.99 for me and my friend. realised i needed all the dlc so we bought the complete edition for 17.99 each. so 19.98 already wasted at this point. then the complete edition goes on sale for 8.74. gunshots echo. oh right the game? yeah its good.",33.6
"i really liked the graphics in this game because i only have civ 2 before this. there are alot better selections to control your nation and i really liked the scenarios.",17.7
"great game whenever it doesnt crash, corrupt your save files, desync, lag etc. perfect if you want to screw over your friends, backstab them or kill their settlers on turn 20 with your scout wandering around. 10/10",53.5

"so there i was minding my own business building structures in the name of montezuma when my next door neighbor arabia(historically accurate btw) invades with thirteen units. so i hold up in a city with my three units and they give me money. then i look south and decide to invade america with sweden. me and swedeland are now best buds. but that dont matter because on another continent xerxes is building a spaceship and theyre arent any trojan condoms around. so as a last ditch effort i send two cruisers a carrier and the enola gay to nuke there capital. 10/10",120.2
"theres a brabarian look wait  it has my settler get back here!!!",25.8
"i dont have anny free time left. its a addiction.",174.5
"a strategy game made simple. there is a very small learning curve, so impatient people such as myself are able to get into it quickly. graphics are pretty, and fill the world with color. civilization v is probably the only strategy game i enjoy playing as i cant really get into fantasy or sci-fi type strategy games (e.g. civilization: beyond earth), and civilization v is alone in being a good, recent game out there that takes place on our earth. playing with existing countries, historical figures, and real life wonders brings the whole thing closer to home. im sure many share my sentiment. overall, its a fun game in which ive managed to eek out well over two hundred hours, and im looking forward to civilization vi. i highly recommend the expansion packs, if thats what theyre called.",322.1
"im a big fan of civ games, and this one i like the most. stacks of doom are gone at last :)",986.0

"ive been playing this game since the first version came out long ago. im still just as addicted to it.",515.3

"awesome game i highly recommand this game if you like turned based strategy game",118.1
"concise review pros- seems lacking in depth but once the game progresses the depth completely gets gigantic -very fun to play offline, most offline sim games suck compared to online, but this holds up -tons of playstyles and choices you can you to win -extra fat from other civ games have been cut off cons-mp has a large amount of bugs that hinder gameplay -game is too long for mp, most people (including myself) dont have time to sit at their laptop for 10 hours, but pitboss is too slow to play simultaneously rating- 9/10",238.9
"a masterpiece in turn based strategy. if on sale, i highly recommend buying the complete edition as the dlcs completely change and improve the gameplay. ai players can be annoying in single player by refusing to work with you but if you have 3 or 4 friends to play with it is a much better experience.",205.0
"sick strategy game i reccomend that anyone interested in games such as total war should get it great fun! :d",59.9
"one... more... turn... i cant tell you how many times i have said those three words while playing this game. if you love strategy, history, alternate history, or just having a good multiplayer match with friends, get this game. where else will you become peacekeepers with genghis khan and atilla? where else will you team up to defeat the evil, warmongering, nuclear menace that is gandhis india? where else will you find mods that allow you to play as the daleks, arstotzka or even equestria? no where! so get the game already! (dont forget all of the dlc!) 10/10",245.3
"yes. its like the sims but a trillion times better. get it.",69.8
"civlization v is one of those games that becomes very addicting once you get the swing of things. minutes go by like hours, and this game [appears to be] somewhat educational, so i dont feel as bad for playing this game for hours at a time. looks pretty good on directx 11, but will take up a lot of memory on your computer, so having nothing else running in the background is recommended.",131.0
"a truly amazing turn-based strategy that will have you gritting your teeth all the way through, i would 100% recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested in the stategy genre. now if you excuse me i have to go and kill babylon this game keeps pulling me back for more!",89.4
"this game has great variety when it comes to choices of strategies. i have spent a lot of time playing this game and its predecessors.",352.5
"great game, the biggest complaint for the game would be the fact that no matter what, once your borders get close to another ai civ, not only will you be at basically guaranteed war, (no matter what previous relations) but the other civs and the one that declared war on you will categorize you as warmongering 95% of the time, when i wasnt even the one that declared the unprovoked war, deteriorating relations with allies that arent near my cities. plus, this scenario is almost definitely bound to happen, unless you play with 3 or less ais. its difficult to really push ahead of the other civilizations for a science or culture victory when your resources are being nearly forced toward military due to they covet lands you currently own!",81.6
"a very good civilization game and is better than beyond earth. play this if you love risk. 9/10",69.0
"i played civ ii when i was a 13 years old child, and i still remember these long, sometimes even overnight sessions ;). i skipped civ iii and iv, as i was always feeling of it being the same than before, but then i found civ v on steam winter sale and bought it. and it still feels like in my memories. so one might say that there wasnt much innovation, but when civ wasnt played a long time ago or civ hasnt been played at all this feeling of growing a nation and becoming more and more powerful is still great. and still it produces the same one more round feeling as always before. personally i recommend civ v to everyone who hasnt played civ at all or where it has been a while. for the ones who played iii and iv i have the feeling that its still the same.",16.0
"most of the time i dont know what im doing, which is good cause no one else does either. enjoyable experience but you need to play with friends.",42.3

"are you seriously just considering buying this game? just buy it, it is such a great game. you will have endless hours of fun if you buy this game. get your friends to buy it also. the multiplayer is so great. this overall is a game that you dont want to miss out on. now, run along and buy this game, now!",958.9

"an utter piece of  unless you have every piece of dlc, especially gods and kings as well as brave new world. with these dlc, the game goes from being an abomination to an actually fun sequel to the brilliant civ iv. it has its issues even with all the dlc and patches, but there is definitely still a lot of fun and enjoyment to be had with it.",310.4
"wtf i cant play civ anymore it says i have to re buy it????",49.7
"dont like board games, just because you dont like boards? bada-bing! civ 5, !",17.2
"ive played civ 5 for hundreds of hours at this point. its an excellent game, always challenging and a great way to spend a weekend. this game is endlessly replayable, and each new expansion just makes it better. with a huge community of mods, you can always find a new or interesting scenario, civ, or strategy to play. you can play it as deep or superficial as you want, although understanding the nuances of the game does give you a significant advantage, as you might expect. well worth your time and money.",459.1
"great game, if you have well over 100 hours to spare.",383.7
"long term playabiliy... i keep coming back to this again and again. destined to be a classic. the dlc is usually well thought out too, but not really necessary to enjoy the game. if you like strategy and war games, this is the king of the pile...",517.9

"gandhi, what the hell is wrong with you, you do not need nuclear bombs.",28.6
"you will lose plenty of sleep because of this game, it will pull you in and it wont let you out, but you really wont care while playing it. you will look at your clock before playing the game and figure you have a few hours, 15 hours later, you will be in your underwear, with pizza sauce on your chin, and you can hardly stay awake as you are trying to complete your manhattan project to finally build a nuke to unleash nuclear devistation on the opposing civilization of your choosing. once you do, you wont stop until the whole map is yours, and once it is, your face will have the largest smile youve ever had because of all the work youve put forth. all in all, buy the dang game! 10/10",86.3
"great game meant to last a long time so dont suggest playing it all the way through. wonderful game though :d",59.6
"is it even worth leaving a review at this point? a great game you can easily lose yourself to, leading to the famous just one more turn... syndrome. just make sure you get the package with all the expansions. it really uplifts the game in a drastic way and you wouldnt want to play without them.",179.9
"first turn based strategy game i actually gave a good go, ive always liked rts instead. i was expecting to not like it much as it has turn based military battles, however to my surprise i really loved it. i still dont really like the military side, but there is so much else to do and many different ways to win. ive clocked over 200 hours on this game and i feel ive only completed a fraction of what there is to do. would highly recommend this game.",223.4
"sid meier hates time. therefore, he continues to perfect his perpetual time sink.",171.8
"just... one... more... turn. theres one simple reason why ive avoided playing this game, its so easy to get lost in it and before you know it, its 3am and youre wondering where the times gone. definitely worth it.",42.0
"amazing game, extremely addicting and fun. just dont play it without the brave new world expansion, it adds really nice stuff and fix a lot of problems in the base game and gods and kings expansion. totally worth it to buy the complete edition when its 50% off. :)",631.9
"this game is the pinacle of civilization perfection. every civilization game up until now has been leading up to this masterpiece. civ iii was an amazing game, and i felt that civ iv lost a lot of the luster that made me love iii so much. but this game has gotten it back. buy it. play it. love it.",58.1
"its civ, with heagonal tiles and 1upt, a must buy! but, since day one, it still needs a large patch to fix its large number of bugs...",445.1
"every game is more fun on a console, except for turnbased and rts-games. and king of them all is civilization v! the only game which is mandatory for the pc.",108.4

"great way to spend a lazy weekend, slaughtering your enemies on the battlefield! 10/10",156.6
"if youre willing to put hours into a game, and see direct results, this is that game. games take forever, but thats a good thing. all of the dlc adds interesting new content, and is priced fairly for what it includes. online multiplayer works great, and everything is very customizable. works great with mac too. if you are getting the game, know that the gods and kings and brave new world dlc packs add and change lots of features, and change tons of things too. they do take time to learn. get this game (preferably durring steam sale when you can get the game and all dlc for half the price it normally goes for)",151.3
"playing all the time, when i am feeling a strategist",15.1
"although this is a great game, and thats from a person like me who doesnt really dig strat games, it is just so poorly done for multiplayer we constantly have to restart it.",17.9
"good gameplay and not too harsh on the eyes either! 8/10",99.1
"this is one of the best games of all time.... does exactly what you want a game to do ... consume you in your down time.",463.7
"an amazingly well made and fun turn-based game that i would recommend to any and all gamers. i mainly play multi-player with friends but the single-player (especially with the dlc) is great as well.",265.1
"the base game is not nearly as good without the dlc but still adicting enuogh to motivete me to buy the full version. be warned always check the time while playing can get quite lost in it! not the best ai but im not a completly huge gamer plus differnt diffucluty levels which is good. p.s beware gandhi he is not a pascfist!",96.3
"nuclear warheads, what more could i possibly say other than death robot. oh wait, it has those too.",114.9
"fun fun fun fun, made me look foward to the weekend, until 7:45, when i would get off to eat dinner then cruise on the highway with friends. usually i play on friday.",873.2
"this is the best turn-based game that ive played. it has lots of civs with unique bonuses, good ais, multiple different ways to win, and good graphics. overall, its just about as good as it gets.",112.4
"dont buy it if you wanna keep your social life (pick up the gold pack by the way , totally worth it , gods and kings makes the game way better than base , and its not more expensive by much :d) joke aside very very good and satisfiying game , buy buy buy",33.4
"id inject this game into myself if that was possible",257.4
"great game, but even better with the brave new world or gods and kings expansion packs. i highly recommend this for anyone. very easy to learn too, and has mod support!",66.9
"a fantastically polished example of the turn-based strategy genre. it evokes a similar feeling to the call to power spin-offs, which i like a lot. its also a very addictive game: if minecraft has gamers saying just one more block for hours on end, then the equivalent civ 5 addict would utter just one more turn again and again. all in all, if you like turn-based strategy, theres little here to dislike. just be wary of gandhis nuclear strike program.",431.4
"i`ll play it for an hour ... yeah, an hour :d time goes fast while playing civilization v <3",24.7
"really good game. needs longer and more campaign maps though and it would be fun to have scenarios that you can play with friends to enhance the multiplayer experience. but still 9 out of 10.",339.3

"ive found a problem with the game i cant click on the help menu or the menue or add to the que or do anything with other people not even click an anwser whe nthey offer something like a declaration of freindship so my game will get stuck and i have to close it any idea why this is happening? i use linux by the way and i think this might be something with just my comp. im not sure though",29.3
"if you like european board games or turn based youll love this great combat cool graphics and awesome researching of technology however pepole declare war on you for no reason even if thier personality is peaceful and your empire is nowhere near them its infuriating and the dimplomacy is pretty bad however if your calm with this stuff youll love it 8/10",67.5
"great game, but i recommend getting the expansions and dlc to unlock its true potential. cant say much thats negative about civ 5. there are times when the early game feels formulaic, but its still fun. i love playing ghandi, making peace with my neighbors....until i savagely ravage their lands and sack their capital!",67.4

"very addictive game which will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours! will also significantly improve your knowledge of history.",194.3
"essentially an enhanced board game with more depth than possible in an actual board game. does a great job of portraying events on a large scale in a streamlined manner. slow-paced as a strategy game, but it suits the theme well. style and design shows a lot of attention to historical details. semi-educational if you want it to be and worth putting some thought into. definitely recommended.",218.3
"one of the best turn-based strategy game :d buy it and then mod it!!!",474.9
"awesome game, one of the best stagergy games out there!",8.1
"very good strategic game with multiple victory conditions available. bought the complete edition in the 2014 steam winter sale and i was uncertain at first but when i began a game with my friend i never looked back. created by the studio who created the well-known stronghold strategy game series, this is a game that absolutely cannot be missed.",68.2
"great game full of fun ways to win also good online with other players 9/10",90.4
"if you are into strategy games than this game is for you. best 4x so far. most people are complaining about the absence of unit stacking. i think absence of unit stacking adds far more tactical depth into the game and multiplies the joy of victory.",177.1

"great game 11/10 got rekt by scrub online. love it.",276.5
"if you value your life, your study/work/family time, your future: do not install this game. its so great, you spend 600 hours on it. seriously, i have never spent as much time on a game in my life... and im not a big gamer, but i do like this. being able to essentially build your own empire, and complex enough to make it enjoyable, whilse difficult enough that its no too easy, its fab. the graphics are good, the music is good, and the added packs keeps the game interesting over the different incarnation of civ v. if you can get this on sale, it is a steal. if you like strategy games, you cant go wrong with having this in your library - its a bit different from your usual build an army, attack style, as you dont want to fall out with everyone! very happy with this, ill not be bothered if this is the last game i ever buy...",878.2
"i already had this game outside of steam but bought it a second time when the expansions were included, needless to say why.",27.6
"i used to really enjoy this game, putting mods on it and playing new maps, playing as historical charecters, and forging empires, incinerating gandhi, pissing off augustus caeser, but then.....the game stopped working, i recently downloaded two map packs, i was happy to try new maps, i was so excited to play them, they downloaded, i press play direct x 11 and 10 the game loaded, the cinematic played, more loading and..... boom! the window closed... what i said. i kept trying to play it, no use, i thought. i looked support, nothing worked, and here i am, writing this angry review about a game i once loved, wishing i could just play that map pack.... why 2k? why?",434.9
"time for another review! im going to go over a few points in the game, and then average them out to give it an overall rating. i still recommend it no matter what the oar is! story: 0/10 there is no story. replayability: 10/10 ive played about 1 week of gameplay. thats a lot for me! content: 8/10 if you buy the dlcs, its got loads of content, if not, it would get 5/10, but i bought them :) multiplayer: 5/10 its got a lot of multiplayer glitches, but fun nonetheless. it cracks me up when it resyncs and my scout turns into a gdr. overall rating: 6/10 (rounded up and simplified)",289.0
"i made this review to  of my friend, it didnt work, but ill post this anyways. p.s this is nice gaem, please buy love you xoxo",7.3
"oh god, where does the time go? do i like this game? sure should i have ever bought this time machine in disquse of a game? no crap, i sat down for a few quick turns at 7pm and finaly looked up at 3am. oh boy, i have to be at work by 8am.. hmm, that might be enough time for a few more turns...",159.3
"amazing game!!! got it during a sale for around $12 and can honestly say i would have paid the full $60! this is the first civilazation game ive played but really got me intrested in the series and i cant wait to see where it goes. reccomend for anyone who wants to feel like their creating history!",74.7
"absolutly amazing game! probably my favourite. put in over 300 hrs and dont plan on stopping anytime soon haha havnt played many other 4x games but this one deffinetly a favourite for anyone who wants to try. highly recommended!! 10/10",346.1
"its a graty game but hard to malty player uther then that its a grate 1 player game",56.7
"bought it, played for 8.4 hours straight. loved it. now i havent played it though completely, but so far its freaking awesome. i personally recommend it to anyone thinking about buying this game. note: requires some patience.",92.3
"pretty good game. not for anyone who is unable to spend hours planning one move only to lose the game. over all though very fun.",52.1
"incredibly addicting game. youll sit down for what you think will be a couple of turns in a quick game....until you find out that youve been playing for 20 hours nonstop. the game has definitely evolved since the earlier titles. there is a clear flow to the game and it allows for multi-tasking in different areas such as the spreading of religion, adopting social polices, etc rather than civilization expansion alone. 15/10 would play again and again. 69/10 will never trust ghandi again.",58.6
"great game, cannot wait for the next one to come out!",361.3
"this series has sucked more hours out of my life than my family and friends combined. i weep for my soul.",1.3
"i have been an avid civ player since the first release, and of course i had to have v as well. but i must say i was somewhat disappointed. its not that the game sucks big-time or anything, but i dont like many of the new stuff. firstly i hate the city states. they are way to expensive to be friends with and since war is always a slow and costly procedure in civ, they are not worth invading. i quite frankly dont see their purpose. secondly the new religion creator doesnt appeal to me. the idea is ok, but i get to choose from a lot of perks that are not that well explained, so i end up choosing randomly. its not a terrible game, but i will just go back play civ iii witch in my opinion is the best one yet.",21.4
"this is one of those games that everyone on steam needs to have in their library if you dont already have it as your most played game.",186.1
"this game reminds me a bit of age of empires. ill have to give this game a 7/10 for three reasons no campign mode(only 1 campaign as genghis khan) muitplayer is buggy and it gets boring and repitieve after a while. but for the price this game is good.",55.1
"really fun, but can be time consuming. i start a game at 2 p.m. , and before i know it, it is 9 p.m.! very addicting, and requires strategy. i built the great wall of brazil. ghandi made the great pyrimids of canada. washington made america where china is today. i lost the space race to the aztecs. 20/10",198.7
"if you are like most civilization addicts, your story began innocently enough way back in 1991 with the discovery of sid meiers civilization by firaxis games. the original civ, as its called on the streets, and its two subsequent sequels, ii and iii, allowed you to create or conquer vast civilizations-from the dawn of man to the space age and beyond. the unique turn-based strategy game quickly became the game of choice for gamers around the world. for some, however, it became more than that...it became an addiction.",56.0

"civilization. sid meiers. its as great as it will ever get.",52.1
"i never was into turn based strategy games, however civilization games always caught my interest.",79.3

"you know the game: build your stuff whilst destroying or slowing the others and hope that ghandi does not nuke you five turns into the game.",198.5
"great game, a little bit complicated at first but you learn as you go",18.9
"i have put an absurd amount of time into this game, and it still doesnt feel like ive done enough. there are literally millions of ways to change the game, how its played, your current situation in-game, your interface, blah blah blah. most important thing i learned is that deity is difficulty is hard as  and gandhi shouldnt be ed with in the atomic era. id recommend this game to anyone looking for a good way to pass the time or a really competitive nerd.",408.9
"you will get lost in this game and realize its morning and you have to get to class/work",128.7

"amazzing game and good as sid meiers game always 5/5 would play again",69.4
"this is not so much a game as it is a kind of time machine. ill start playing a game in the morning and look from my screen to the window only to realize that the sun has gone down. i then tell myself, ill just finish up a few neighboring nations and by the time i am done with that the sun is up again.",101.6
"great game that sucks you in for hours at a time. i can never sit down for less than an hour without craving more. some would compare to meth, but a tad bit safer. 9.5/10",182.9
"great game but mainly only worth it if u buy all the dlc and it was deffinatly worth the $25 usd i paid. it is a great time stealer and keeps you entertained for hours",41.1
"really fun game, makes you think, would advise anyone who likes chess to play this game.",55.2
"this is the first civilization game ive had a chance to play and it is fantastic! there are so many possible ways to play that make it very enjoyable.",34.8
"this is the best game ever, you cant stop playing you gain such a determination to advance your culture.",69.5
"so many.. unfinished games.. so much time wasted.. 10/10",81.3
"civilization v is the best game in the series yet. the gods and kings and brave new world expansions are crucial to the experience, although the base game is decent on its own. these expansions make the culture victory possible and interesting, which adds a nice counter to military and technology.",307.8
"if you love risk you will love this! games lasts for hours and hours and there is never a shortage on what to do :d a+++++++",11.9
"5 x 5 = 21. 2+1 = 3 half life 3 comfirmed! buy this game.",443.0

"10/10 my nation america surived for centuries along side of my friend russia. we were wiping out the remenants of the arabs when all of a sudden my dear friend, the only person i trusted betrayed me. as sad as i was about this happening, i could only blame myself for being a gullible too trusting person. would play, and buy again if i had to. great game",52.0
"what started out as a glitchy mess with (for me) less than 100 hours of play, turned into a glorious game full of replayability with friends or alone thanks to its potent dlc. this game, with its large workshop/modding community, is easily one of my favorite games of all time, allowing you to recreate historical dynasties or forge your own path. games can drag on for hours, which may be seen as a draw back, but the desired way to play this game for me is to relax while watching netflix or a movie on a second monitor and save when ive had enough for the day. id recommend buying the dlcs with this game, as it will greatly improve the game overall. it goes on sale often.",742.8
"one of the best games i have ever played. the replay value is what makes this game worth while. the game changes through every playthrough because you can make 1000 different decissions between each era leading to different endings. one game being the world leader peacfully desiding to host the world games, the next game you could be a war mongering leader that rules a majority of the world.",943.3
"literally just random countries racing to space first no one even bothers to fight",67.3

"this game teaches that the worlds leaders are . also, its nearly impossible to stop playing just...one...more...turn..!!",68.7
"highly addictive - the bnw and g&k expansions make the complete a worthwhile purchase after the original. only complaint is mac users are prevented from every earning the download a mod achievement.",519.3

"one of the best 4x games on the market. only if you are willing to by the gods and kings and brave new world expansions as the base game is rather weak",106.9
"best strategy game ive ever played, one of my favorite games ever. mods, scenarios, and different victory types allow for basically endless gameplay. definitely get it if you havent already. the expansions, gods and kings and brave new world, are worth their asking price and make the game much better.",215.7
"addictive and can be as complex or simple as you want, with help from the plethora of mods out there.",336.1
"this game is amazing, it is fun alone and amazing with friends. :)",311.5
"civ5 is such a great game! bought it retail when i never played a civ game before, and i loved it right away. its only excellent if you have the 2 expansions though, vanilla game was mediocre at best. expansions added a buttload of civs (total of 43, when there were only about 8), each having its own great leader speaking in their native language, making for characters full of personality. there are many mechanics, which i will not list, but i will say that they are very intuitive and you will get the hang of it very quickly, and will understand rapidly which civs have good bonuses (poland, korea, babylon...) and which ones are crap (spain, byzantium...). the music in this game is something that really stuck to me, especially for european civs. this game made me like classical music.",76.8
"mighty fun strategic game only if you have the dlc. 10/10 destroyed north korea",48.5
"liked the game but not as good as civ 4. i would get it but cant wait for the next one",33.6

"very good game. becomes even better with the dlc expansions.",302.6
"base game was okay, but with expansions it became soooooooooooo much better.",270.4
"this game is really addicting and well worth the $13.74 cad, keeps you busy and has many options to chose from and more than one way on how to play the game. the complete edition is what i got and its very fun to play. the only annoying parts i see in the game is when you use any nuclear bombs near a mountain the fallout stays there and you cannot use any of the workers to clear it. perhaps theres a mod to get rid of it? i kinda only wished there was more civilizations to pick from when youre setting up the game because with only few to pick some even with the dlcs. it seems like theres a lot more missing that the game could had placed in. this game is one of my most favorite games on steam right now. im glad i got to purchase it when it was only 60-70% off.",103.6
"hands down, this is the best civilization yet. the graphics, trades, and politics of the game are perfect ways to pass countless hours of time without you even knowing it.",19.4
"fun edit: was fun multiplayer has been ruined on oct. 27th by devs latest update. the devs didnt even admit to it untill almost a month later, and only deep in a random forum post. possibly the worst dev teams public relations ever. so well over a month later and no fix yet they sell the game in steam store and make no mention of it. **buyers beware!** this is what you will get when you buy this. multiplayer is broken. so for single players its great fun. *****edit #2 : after a month and a half, quietly they let loose a hotfix for the multiplayer problems they created, very poor customer service, great game though.",653.8

"never ever trust ghandi or germeny they will kill you",215.9
"this is the best turn-based stratagy i have played in a long time. the depth of the diplomacy systems is incredible and makes it feel far more realistic than any other game in its category. the variant victory types allows a large range of freedom in what you can focus your empire on. the tech system is amazing and makes sense, the culture system is undescribably better than anything like it, and the advisors give usful, if reppetitive, advice. can you build you empire to dominate the world?",150.0
"time flies as one heads up one great civilization after another. for an old-school civ-player, all this religion and diplomacy malarkey can get a bit hectic and feels a bit foreign at first, but it definitively adds to the atmosphere of the game. it is a well-balanced turn-based strategy game with an incredible amount of content. i have only managed to win at king once and it took some thinking in the end-game. success is not always guaranteed, but a few setbacks along the way arent necessarily fatal. recommended for anyone with a fair bit of spare time on their hands. its addictive nature rarely allows for just a quick five minutes... type of play, but that is part of its timeless charm.",154.5
"create, or get destroyed civilization is the most addictive game there is on the steam market today. every time i play time passes by so fast, and it just gets better and better. gameplay might be slow at sometimes, but when you eventually play for several hours it becomes insanely fun! there are endless amounts of what you can do in civilization, even a unit called a giant death robot. i would rate this game 20/5 if i could, never will i get bored of this game! get it now!",37.0
"a wonderful game. very detailed. have played it regularly for for a couple of years.",176.4
"this game is surpisingly deep and it feels like its deceptively simple. theres more than one way to play the game and the brave new world dlc adds even more. totally worth checking out and theres a demo just to make sure you enjoy it. i have logged way too many hours onto this because it is way too damn addicting. one more turn,,,",45.4

"though i do recommend buying this game, that doesnt change the fact the firaxis is full of greedy jews (please pardon my bigotry). wanting $30 each for thier dlc. however, after ive typed this out, ill probably cave-in and buy g&k. but guess what? thats exactly what they (firaxis) knew would happen!",117.7

"i played this game for a few weeks in total so far. its pretty good, so in case you missed it, get it on a sale for sure. its probably the best title in the whole civilization series, excluding the 1999s alpha centauri which i played for years. civ 5 is slightly better than civ 2, and its very different. if id be asked to arrange all the civ versions and related games in order of how much i liked them, it would be: alpha centauri with alien crossfire addon civ 5 with addons (this one) civ 2 pandora first contact beyond earth civ-evo freeciv civ 1 civ 4 call to power 1 and 2 civ 3 so yes, if you have somehow missed civ 5, grab it on a sale.",23.6

"great game. better than civ4 if you like warfare. prior to civ5, i always wondered why the civilization series didnt take a page out of the wargaming book ala hex-based, 1 unit per hex combat. the doomstacks of earlier civilizations seemed odd to me, and a poor way to implement warfare. at release, civ5 non-warfare areas needed a lot of work, but theyve really brought them up to par with expansions. overall, a wonderful game.",105.8

"get this. being a turn based strategy gives you plenty of time to learn the mechanics as you go, advisors are there as well to guide you through and as you generally follow them youre bound to conquer the easy to medium difficulties while learning enough to turn it up a notch. might have some performance issues late game, and can be dodgy on multiplayer. save often when you do play multiplayer also the intro scene when you start the game is also a loading screen, just wait for it after spamming escape or something.",260.5

"dangerously addictive game. this game makes you sit for hours and forget time. all hours that fly away with sitting on this game is 1337% wurf. could not wish for better strategy game. 133769% must play for people with a brain.",190.6
"ive been playing this game since the first version came out long ago. im still just as addicted to it.",515.3
"if you dont know or never played civilization yet, i strongly recommend you to stay away from it. it is highly addictive and will lead you to quarell with your family over it because you just spent too much time on playing it.",14.4
"this game is simply a must buy, even at full retail price!",127.9
"awesome game i highly recommand this game if you like turned based strategy game",118.1
"concise review pros- seems lacking in depth but once the game progresses the depth completely gets gigantic -very fun to play offline, most offline sim games suck compared to online, but this holds up -tons of playstyles and choices you can you to win -extra fat from other civ games have been cut off cons-mp has a large amount of bugs that hinder gameplay -game is too long for mp, most people (including myself) dont have time to sit at their laptop for 10 hours, but pitboss is too slow to play simultaneously rating- 9/10",238.9
"bonbon approves of this game 10/10 it is a really fun game once you get to know what you are doing and for those who are new, there is advisors that will give a helping hand. the victories available are fun and made for all kind of players, i do say however it is best getting this and the two main dlcs (brave new world and gods and kinds) as it adds so much more to the game. overall this game is just great and..where else would ghandi be a war mongering dictator who likes to nuke you xd",249.4
"had no idea what i was doing but i think i won 10/10 would be confused again",99.6
"a great strategy game, and if you play smart, you can conquer the other people easy. take the city states and build your cities there, then wipe out nations one at a time",0.9
"great game but only if you get the two main dlcs in my opinion",103.4
"one of the greatest games ive ever played, extremely addicting and engaging. the absolutely broken multiplayer kills the whole experience though, so i sadly cannot reccomend it. edit: they fixed the multiplayer, got nothing to complain anymore, can really recommend this game :d",98.7
"great game especially with al the dlcs i recommend for everyone who loves video games that take awhile but are extremely fun for a long time.",50.0
"ethiopia is the most well fed civ... gandhi is warmongering bast@rd... poland can into space... my worker from 3000 bc survives until 2050 ad... i can create my own religion... this game is very realistic",293.9
"gahndi nuked me then i suprised him with x-coms and death robots 10/10 would future america again",182.5
"a very good civilization game and is better than beyond earth. play this if you love risk. 9/10",69.0
"this game is crap, crashes every 10 turns or so. its not worth the money i paid for it. fail sid fail",114.0
"would reccomend for new strategy game players, it has great tutorials and explenations. also, looks pretty and is very addictive.",29.8
"this game is honestly my favourite out of all the games ive played so far. as you can see ive logged 120 hours and plan to log even more with the bnw expansion pack that im getting. the graphics are still awesome and i still get chills every time i nuke a enemy city :d",133.9
"who doesnt want to take over russia and germany and china?",22.2
"if you enjoy getting mentally butt hurt play this game",20.0
"the single player in this game is great, but due to recent patches the multiplayer has been broken. games constantly desync and lag. if you want to get this game for multiplayer wait until the devs patch it",124.9
"freaking awesome!!! sid has done it again. he has a legacy me thinks.",4.1
"very fun, very addictive, though ive only played the game with the brave new world expansion pack added, which apparently makes it a whole lot better than vanilla, according to some friends. grabbing both together can set you back a pretty penny so if youre interested, id recommend picking this one up when its on sale. its a great blend of peaceful and tense that really keeps you in the game, be it leaning back in your chair or on the edge of it.",418.6
"i have bought every civilization game ever made, i love this game and i still do, but i dont appreciate loosing my option to play the game without being connected & being forced to do so while paying full price. this is in my opinion a betrayal by the franchise i have grow to love over the years. i will not purchase another game. though i think this is a fantastic platform it is not how i personally like to handle my business. i dont want anyone to know what im doing at any given moment if i choose not to tell them. this is my right to have privacy any i feel kinda violated.",129.3
"great game.thery indepth.get the complete package.its worth it",24.6
"im generally not a big gamertoo many other things to do with my timebut civ v (like most of the civilization franchise) sucks me in and keeps me coming back for more. the variety of civilizations available, potential win conditions, and different strategies for early-, mid-, and late-game all add to replay value. generally addictive.",1051.3
"ill make this short- if you like the civ series this is the pinnacle of them. the sheer variety of different units and the progression of the game, with many different possible wins (conquest, diplomatic, culture, science, ect.) makes this one of my favorite games.",625.1
"this game annoy me just gut ask by rome if i could help them kill germans and i say oki but he had to wait 10 rounds so i could be ready they 10 rounds pass and im haf way down to germany and then rome decleare war agianst me insted of germany the computer have no problem whith attacking you from behiend whith out warning then you kick their  and they want peace you refuce and take the capital and some how they make peace whith out you know it and you have to wait and in the mean time the computer talks bad about to the other contry saying you are the bad guy so they also wanna attack you you never know if they are your friend or they wanna attack you dislike",45.5
"if you are a fan of the civilization series, you will enjoy this game. great replay value.",245.1
"love this game! not really used to playing these types of games. however im really into this! the best thing about it is the amount of people you get in a game (wheher its ai or online players). its just means there is always something to do, be aware of and work towards. some games, you have to wait a many turns to accomplish something. in civ 5 it seems like you are constantly working towards a goal.",9.8
"conquered one city state, everyone denounces me. war mongering gandhi killed everyone in africa 10/10",59.4
"i played the other games in the series a lot but held off on this one for a while, thinking it wouldnt be good. i was wrong. its civilization. its gonna keep you up at night.",13.8
"when it works, a great game- its a prettier civ iv, but still not as stable.",178.6
"i think civ4 modded to death still wins out. civ5 is catching up quick and i think it will take the place as my favorite civ. no matter what the panzer general type combat and terribly unbalanced build times will always throw me off. 7/10 - good game, but has issues, and i dont agree with the game mechanics direction the series took here.",745.4
"great game with the expansions. very gamey, not simulationist. needs more mods.",234.0
"addictive. very addictive. i try playing nice. i just want most/all the good resoures and to expand my empire(s). 10/10",226.9
"i gave ghandi truffles, he gave me nothing to call home. 10/10 would ghandi again",128.0
"this game destroyed my sleeping schedule....... but within the same day, it fixed my sleeping schedule. 24/10 would destroy and fix my sleeping schedule again!",216.2
"i actually felt embaressed to play this game online for a very good reason. the hours...the amount of hours to can waste playing this game is ridiculous, i swear when i first played the game, it was around 7pm, when i finally gave up on the match, it was around 7am. so i thought it was better for my reputation to play it offline to prevent my account from telling the world of my approx  hrs playing this game. this game may not look it but it is an incredibly good time waster and after putting a lot of work into a match, you want to commit to finishing the match and winning it. i wouldnt want to recommend this game to others as when you finally finish playing this game, you might find yourself with grey hair and aging bones at the approximate age of 80? but overall it is a great stratagy game with a lot of mods which make the game eveb bigger.",37.0
"it think it helps if you have someone who can help you with this game in the early stages, as it takes a while to remember what each of the things on screen actually does, but id definitely reccomend it. lots of options as to what you can do once youve got past the early stages.",18.4
"really enjoyable but takes hours - days or longer to play would definitely recommend.",32.6
"a very good game with endless possibilities as loads of countries.",115.3
"i bought this game on offer with all dlc and i have to say, it is a very good game. the gameplay is very addicting and you always want to complete just one more turn. there is progression, so you can be bad at the game and still really enjoy it. the features seem quite balanced and are fair on players. you can play it however you want, with other victories than just killing everyone. plus, it even runs lag-free on my non-gaming laptop. overall, i do very much recommend.",18.7
"played this game awhile back during its free trial. very fun when you need a couple hours to kill. if i get the extra cash i may think about getting it. still too pricy for me right now though.",280.7
"when i discovered the mods, since then i only play the msf-nation civ/civ would play another turn",168.2
"playing as japan and conquering everything. nuked by gandi would play and get nuked again 11/10",28.7
"this game is so addicting! too bad i failed a french test for it though.",89.1
"with all the expansions and dlc, civ 5 is not acutally that bad of a game, and is quite fun. plus it has mods. mods are awesome, and some of them are quite good, others are quite bad.",103.3
"1, trusted ghandi. 2. helped him eliminate napoleon. 3. ghandi declares war on me while i was weak. 4. with my last breath i took one of his city and ate his cattle (cows). 5. never trust ghandi 11/10",21.8
"an amazing turn-based strategy game, this is the icon of the genre.",175.5
"just love this game, especially with the a brave new world expansion pack. love the fact you can adapt to every situation differently and sometimes have to decide to slow down one progress to get a specific type of victory. spending hours on this game ^^",360.6
"its epic luv it and its best strategy game eveer 2nd is clash of clans",9.5
"interesting game. really liked it. i pleayed it with the mediteranian mod which made me so proud to play alexander the great! i had some problems with it crashing but a quick google fixed it",8.6
"my first civilization series game experience. thoroughly impressed. hours upon hours of gameplay and still feel like ive only cracked the surface of this game. awesome.",38.3
"its a civ game. its not perfect - the ai is lacking, as always, and there are bugs - but its still good fun.",307.9
"i love this game. it uses indepth stragety with historical traits that are spot on and fun to learn about.",106.4
"just wow. great graphic addicting gameplay and makes you hate ghandi for betraying you",1.5
"the best version of civilization ever released for pc. such a fantastic deep game with incredible replayability.",90.5
"this is my gateway 4x game. ever since i started playing this, ive been delving deeper into the genre that previously i didnt even know existed. this may be simplified compared to others, but its perfect for people who are new and curious about what all this civilizations and turn based 4x games are about.",238.6
"i enjoy the game whole-heartedly and any problems i have with it are minute at best. except the problem of the base game being reletively dull, therefore seriously requiring the expansions in order to maximise the enjoyment out of this. other than that, it is an extremely enjoyable and addiciting game.",63.9
"the game is so much deep and lot of mod to keep you have fresh experience everytime",50.5
"the best civilization game i have ever played. i have owned every civilization game except the original, and this one is still my favorite. the difficulty scales nicely. there is very high replayability. i never have the same experience twice.",575.9
"its worth playing if you want to make world peace with other superpowers, but if you like world war 2 its worth checking out the red ww2 mod where you can change the history.",102.4
"this game was awesome i had fun playing it for a day for the free weekend, i wish i could get enough money to get back this game permenetly",5.2
"when it comes to losing entire days over a weekend glued to your screen ... civ is at the top of the list... in reality, after years of playing civ through its various generations, civ 5 now sits at the level sofistication that the developers had to leave planet earth to take a step forward... literally.",592.4
"its a really good game. i enjoyed the 2 days of this game, now im attracted to it like tobacco.",21.2
"it was interesting i couldnt find the tutorial tho",0.9
"this game wow... just wow. lets get to the point. good stredegie game. good animethins. good grafichs. with a lot of history involved with the leaders and wonders. lost of mods in the comunety workshop like more leaders and maps etc. 1 big note to the peps that what to get this game purgase that full game with all the dlcs. (sid meiers civilization v : complete edition) the 10 more  is really whorf it. i hope this helpt u make a poit on bying the game yes or no (sorry for the englich in am form the netherlands ;) )",15.7
"whats with the game last i played it ,it was last night 10/23/2014 but the game said last day i played it was on tuesday that would be 3 days before now it wont let me play the game without paying for it, so in my opinin the game is not worth downloading, playing it for 3 times then gotta download the 49.99 to 23.99 upgrades is not worth the time on free games,, i would not recommend to anybody to take the time to download this game!",0.2
"one of the best strategy games available. the dlcs also add a huge amount of extra material and some great scenarios. great fun, if you dont have it, get it!",126.6
"here you have a very nice and addictive game recommended for anybody who has at least a bit of strategy in his mind, even more addictive if you play online. has a good gameplay, fun decisions made by the ai, with good graphics even untill now. i bought this game 2-3 years ago and played it for some time, but now i found some freinds who also own the game and so i started playing some civ5 again, but online. this is a very enjoyable game. i personally preffer civ 5 over the new beyond earth. for the multiplayer feature this game worths every cent!",106.7
"i love this game, the fact that you can make your own civilation is awesome. i also recomend this to yo kid cauz this is good for learning to.",8.7
"i would recommend if you have a friend to play it with. the single player is ok but the multiplayer is the best.",67.3
"cant stop playing... :d super great game, the best from the civ serie.",236.0
"best civ i have played so far: i have played civ 2,3,4 and civ rev i would suggest this one to anybody the game is brilliant for singleplayer, multiplayer and modding and even though civ beyond earth is now out i would still recommend this to any gamer. truely a great game :)",114.5
"bought this game nearly 1 year ago. 500 hours game time. i have divorced my wife and bought shares in dominos pizza.",863.2
"an incredible game, though i found civ 4 better, a quick comparison of the two would pretty much state that civ 4 has amazing micro-management while civ 5 has great combat and graphics going for it. buy both while youre at it! but make sure you have friends to play with, single-player can get boring very quickly.",11.2
"get the brave new world expantion if you want to play this game. it makes it so much better.",366.5
"buy it. you wont regret it! hours of fun. never gets old with the workshop items.",59.4
"if you do buy this game i only have 1 thing to say never under any conditon im meaan anything (seriously guys) do not let ghandi mass destroyer of worlds take your uranium (seriosuly he will take it build nukes then nuke you with your own uranium i mean common)",62.2
"just add this game to your cart. then during checkout, choose a friend to receive your gift.... and they will both love you and hate you for the rest of their computer-chair bound life.",285.8
"feeling as though i am in a time portal with this game start playing at 8 in the evening and finish at 10am. could of sworn i was only at the game for an hour!!!",89.7
"great game that for once makes me feel so powerful and that nothing can stand in my way. almost like adolf hitler, but im not going into all that type of stuff. 9.75/10",62.1
"this game is more addictive than crack. i will not stop until every hex in the world is mine! paint the world!!! just one more turn...",238.4
"its a fun game. lead civ victory or death. 5 different victories. break laws of earth soch as aztecs rule world. no eygiptians only a few or many civs. be who inspires you. personilities based on how they were in real life. either you canquer the world make world peace or find a new palnet to live on.",117.1
"it was a great game for the short time i played it. it is much like aoe, but mixed with risk, it is lots of fun. im not so sure its worth $30, but im tempted to get it. im getting the demo immediatly. 5/5",4.7
"i got three things playing this game. time leap, joint stiffness on my hands and waist and a great fun!",17.1
"so mnay hundreds of hours, greatest game in all history up to its own time",406.0
"fantastic game, very well balanced and alot of fun in general. difficult for begineers to civlization though, there are plenty of guides and to my experience just playing on your own your way ends up to be the most fun and addictive gameplay instead of you just using a tactic that everyone else uses and trully ruining the purpose of learning the game your way, just like any individual shoulf play it, but thats only one mans opinion.its a great game, i have 510hrs played of it, and i taught myself everything about the game even though it was my first civ game i had ever played without using the internet xd.",820.4
"this is the best stategy/tactics and tremendously complicated game i have ever played. so, if complex stategy is fun for you, you will love this game.",30.7
"formed catholic for indonesia then met jersualem. 10/10 best game ever.",109.5
"look all i want to do is play the games i purchased not deal with steam bull",226.7

"this is one of the few games you can take with you on the desert island.",1077.0
"like a good book, you wont be able to put this down.",183.8
"brilliant game for you and or friends. even if your friend leaves the game and doesnt want to play anymore, youre able to carry on playing as their slot is taken over by an ai. the only problems that occur for me is when the game progresses on the big maps e.g. earth. as the animations stop, along with most of the sound. 9/10 :)",218.0
"i have yet to be able to get into this game for real. every time i sit down to play it, im overcome with a wave of apathy towards it. even the gods and kings expansion doesnt save it. dont get me wrong, i like the hex tiles and i dont mind not being able to stack up units like crazy... i just think that as far as civ games go, this one is sub-par.",26.7
"this game.. i have never been one for turn based strategy except for rpgs but i cannot seem to put this game. it is more then i could have ever thought. 10/10 would buy again full price.",66.8
"many hours spent playing this game, big time-sink. fun way to pass a weekend with friends or by yourself.",165.9
"god i love this game... im a real sucker for history and civilization v is everything i want from a game; strategy (you need some brains to play), its rich in history and you can spend hours playing it on your own or with friends, both are awesome ways to spend an evening. i couldnt recommend this game more",474.1
"the best game i have ever played! never gets old, a quality no other game i have ever played has.",379.7
"awesome game. id recomend it to the people who like to stratizise by managing a country and keeping to ghanids from biting your face off (that was a refrence to when me and my friend played with 8 ghandis!)",659.7
"one of my favorite games of all time. this is uber perfect. no harsh violence, and you have to think in order to win.",91.8
"still the best 4x series, v has the on-going refinements that makes it difficult to go back and play 1-4, though i prefer stacking units for combat. the end game is still a bit tedious, especially since the ai is still not very good at automating worker units. i still find limited thrill in non-conquest victory conditions but that may have more to do with my style of play than a deficiency in the design.",127.9
"a great game to play when you have a few hours of spare time. the fantastic gameplay, as well as firaxis games amazing attention to both detail and historical accuracy, make this edition of civ its best yet.",194.9
"its civ v, what more do i need to say? buy it on sale.",31.2
"cant start it up most of the time one of the glitchiest games for me and i no longer own it and must re-purchase it because it hates me.",0.4
"awesome game. full of history and interesting gameplay. tons of achievements, too.",9.8
"for a research agreement you have to give me 500 gold uranium and oil plus all your gems. 10/10",143.3
"before playing civilization i was skeptical about how addictive it was supposed to be, boy was i wrong. nearly 100 hours in and im terrified of starting another game because of the way weekends disappear. i hadnt played the game without its expansions but with them the game feels fluid and complete with early, mid and late game requiring changes to focus and strategy. highly recommend.",102.9
"this is a game of strategy (obviously) and forethought. you have to go into a game with a plan and be able to adapt to your surroundings provided your plan goes south. i grew up playing warcraft 2 and warcraft 3, even age of empires for my choices of strategy games. this is the first civilization game in which i have played but after playing it i have to say that it is my new favorite strategy game.",234.1
"this game will skull  your life away. if u have a family or a job dont play this game because you will never stop. get  by the several leaders of the world as you  away 3 hours just to get some catpults. if you dont like this game you deserve to get a razer  down your trachea. life is like a diplomatic victory though, its not worth it.",159.8
"for pc users great game loads of fun but for mac users the game crashes at around turn 150",43.8
"civ 5 is the ultimate time sink. i started with civ 4 and transitioned to 5 to play with friends. while multiplayer chances have fallen through, single player still brings me a lot more entertainment. you want to see your civilization grow and suceed, even if that means crushing everyone else. you never know what may happen in a few rounds and what youll discover.",49.1
"not nearly as fun without all of the dlcs but still entertaining. some of the civs are there just to push your buttons so it is easy to get into a game. great amount of achievements if thats what youre into - so plenty of incentive to just go for it.",13.2
"this is a great game. i played it while it is briefly free, and i wish to purchase it. i recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games.",57.8
"i like it. i just dont see paying 30-50$ on it at that price pont its not worth it maybe a 10/15-30$ price point then id be ok with it",0.8
"great strategy game. one can easily spent several hours by playing this game and got a feeling of spending just few minutes:-). it made my 5 hours waiting at an airport very pleasible;-).",38.8
"after more than 20 years, civilization is still one of the best games out there. the expansion pack (gods & kings) is highly recommended.",377.1

"wanted to nuke the songhai capital, accedently nuked denmark. 10/10",151.6
"if you like strategy games, you would totally want to get this game! this boardgame-like strategy game is the best and your family and friends will shiver in fear as they see you play as the leader of a great empire, they will bow to your will and none shall stop your reign over all beings! literally, the best!",147.2
"the complete edition of civ 5 is really a must-have. with the addition of bnw, the game finally feels like a finished, fleshed-out product. the ai of your foes is fixed and the ideologies get the attention they deserve. often i felt i was repeating actual history when faced with in-game dilemmas. 5 out of 5",396.9
"0/10 gandhi didnt  on my civ with nukes from the start",196.6
"i will always love civ games, but civ 5 kind of takes a step back. its not that challenging and its a lot the same as 4, but i liked 4 more. i do reccommend it though but if ur a civ fanatic like myself, its getting to be a lot of the same old.",104.7
"i love this game, i am updated to gods and kings. i dont like how many civs have far too situational uas and uus, but i have heard that has been mostly fixed with brave new world. that said, i wish the expansions did not cost your first born child. like seriously, upgrading to brave new world doesnt even build off gods and kings! you have to have both if you want certain things. also many mods on the steam workshop (side note: the mods offer a whole new range of experiences and thats great, it keeps me coming back) require both g&k **and** bnw. you can spend a lot of money on this franchise, but if you have the dough its worth it. many mods fix some balance issues and its addictive as all hell. id recommend to people with lots of free time. if you cant spend hours in one sitting, this probably isnt for you.",197.8
"highly recommend this game. if you love strategy this is for you! you find yourself saying just one more turn. the game really needs both expansion packs to complete the game, it is pretty bare without them. good points nice graphics great fun lots of possiblities decent turotials lots of great mods bad points the mulitplayer is fun but badly coded it is very hard to fing the right difficulty some civs are imbalanced the community isnt great overall a really great game 8/10",171.6
"yea this is a good game, spent way to much time just playing one game. but i just need one more turn",81.3
"it really hassnt changed much from the previous civ. im sad to see they took religions out of it... i always thought that was an interesting dynamic.",45.1
"solid gameplay, intuitive system, brilliant tips / hints, multitude of gameplay models rolled into one, fast or slow paced. deffinitive game for any past settlers, stronghold, crusader kings, age of empires, age of mythology or any other city build / rts game. best line up of dlc (no surprise as its 2k ....borderlands) this gme will stand the test of time for sure!",0.3
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. ive spent hundreds of hours in all the scenarios and the game is enjoyable still.",42.5
"great game to be played here folks, but very adictive and hard to put down. like a very good book really. ace graphics, and uber fun.",3.6
"very addictive! but this game is made for who like strategic games. one of the best games on my steams library.",44.3
"friend texts you to go to a movie, you reply ok just let me do one more turn on my game the next text you get from him is wtf where were you? you missed the entire movie 11/10 would miss 3 hour movie for 1 more turn again",185.3
"nothing you can do will stop him, nothing!!! he will continue his advance into your sanctum. he will murder your children and  your woman. he will tear down your petty walls and leave you with nothing, but shame. all hail the eternal glow, for it is gandhi destroyer of worlds!!!",48.5
"once you get the complete edition of this game, this is easilly one of the best turn based strategies i have ever played. very addicting, and fun once you have a bunch of friends to play with.",295.1
"i really like this game. i got into civ when revolution came out on the ps3. ever since i spent alot of time playing the other civ games and by fart this one is the best. when it comes to details, civ 4 might be slightly better, but overall this one takes the cake.",103.4
"one of my favourite sagas of all the time. too addictive :-)",2.6
"by far the most solid and comprehensive game of the series. solid interface that is more intuitive than past games while still maintaining content and features. with the expansions, this game will find any fan of turm-based strategy games many hours of entertainment.",107.4
"dear reader, the only reason i can leave this review is because my laptops battery died. i have escaped from the dreaded next turn button. unfortunatly i am now board, and i can hear the sweet call of civilzation, i fear i will never truly escape..... 10/10",72.5

"ive always been a big civ fan since civ ii and over 400+ in im still playing. the hexagonal tiles plus the combat system change plus the changes to great people (g&k) are some really great changes over civ iv that honestly almost make it impossible to ever go back. its biggest problem is the same that its always been - its pretty slow paced. this is a game that can take a month to play through an entire game.",482.9
"this is one of the great turn based rts that i ever played with. owning this game will never make you regrets because the every game you start there is a different situations that you might encounter and always not predictable specially if you are playing deity with 12 or more civiulizations to compete. the only thing that makes my game hard to finish is to win science victory in deity level. its very hard and awesome. 9/10",38.8
"this game is probably the best turn-based strategy game out there. it is best with all dlcs and expansions. there are many different options when it comes to leaders and strategies to achieve whatever victory you want. the multiplayer is also very good.",174.7

"so many hours wasted but tons of fun, thought much better with dlcs.",126.4
"fun? yes. perfect? almost. maybe. depends on what you want out of a game. i think the game is really good and very enjoyable. some factions might be a bit redundant, sometimes barbarians wreck your early game when sometimes they dont bother to show up, certain aspects are even plain stupid like the spying system but all in all the gameplay is solid. my only critique would be that the game options are a bit to limited. i always wanted to play between certain eras for example. say you can only play from the stone age (or whatever that early age is called) untill the medieval era. sure a technological victory or diplomatic victory would be booted out of the door but if thats my decision why not let me? i think it would open up a world of possibilities, new tactics, and lots more fun. 8/10, prepare to sink a lot of hours in this one.",159.2
"builds a great civilazation by the 1900s, have countless wonders and a strong military, own two other civs capitols and friends with the rest. i enter a trade agreement with ghandi and give him some resources like gold and oil to help him out, ignoring the fascist ghandi stereotype everyone is complaining about. ghandi builds manhattan wonder in 1950 as soon as i press next turn ghandi declares war on me within 14 exact turns ghandi nukes 1/3 of my lands and resources and takes my capitol makes outrageous peace demands which takes almost all of my remaining gold and 2 of 4 of my remaining cities, doesnt want to lose, so i agree. in the next turn bismark declares war against me and in the following turns he takes the rest of my cities 15/10 would be decieved by ghandi again",91.5
"would cause the nuclear apocalypse again just because someone settled a city near me. 10/10",174.0
"civ 5 has an overwhelming amount of detail, so it is a definite game to buy if your pc can handle it. the suggested specs on the steam store page are not enough to actually enjoy the game the way it was meant to be played. the majority of my playing time on this game was with no dlcs, however, the dlcs are excellent. i would highly recommend this game, but only if you have a powerful rig (mine is gtx 760 & i7 processor and still lags occasionally).",327.2

"this is the first game of its type that i have really dove into. to put it simply, its addictive. the ability to play with historical events and mismatch monuments and wonders is always fun. as far as gameplay is concerned, ill say this. ive put over 150hrs into this game and im still learning new things. its as deep as it is complex. dl all the expansions too, they are worth it. especially brave new world.",324.3
"incredibly in depth rts game. requires a lot of thought if you dont want to lose and can be both easy and hard, both long games and short games, and both simple and complex. incredibly fun and very relaxing to sit back with a drink and snack and play. very good game.",16.9

"this game is great, but not worth it unless you get the expansion packs.",19.9
"the trick, is to kill ghandi as soon as possible. dont let his cute inocence fool you, wipe him out before he gets the chance to get too close to you. though people will think of you as a warmonger it is worth it, it will save you. anyways great game 13/10.",136.7

"just got into the civ series with this game. as a new civ player, the single player content alone was worth buying the game. civ veterans seem to disagree on this based on other reviews i read. i let my brother try it and he got hooked. i woke up to him still playing the next morning, so i got it for him for and unlike others, we havent seen any multiplayer issues, yet (hopefully this continues). i think its important to note that i found this game looking for a new rts and it is filling the role quite nicely even though it is turn based and not filled with the fast paced battles i am used to. if anything, the slower pace and individuality of each unit makes it more fun than your everyday rts.",261.4
"sick of the game as its keeps crashing 3/4 of the way through game play. not worth the time if its crashes so often which is a shame as it is still a great game",119.7
"ive really liked civ 5 a lot. ive been going around buying a lot of reasonably cheap games recently trying to find something i can really be dedicated to and civ 5 hit me on every intrest level. its a game of politics, economics, war, ideology, and trading. i love all of the historical leaders you can trade with, become allies with, go to war with, or be one of them. i played march of war which made me not a huge fan of turn based games. civ 5 completetly changed my mind bringing a whole new meaning to the term turn-based for me. the only thing i would really say was bad in this game is the multiplayer. i strongly advise you just make a game with freinds and organize it if you want to have a successful online game. if you want to just play with anyone you want then it will probably crash or people will quit. overall this game is a 9/10",210.1

"you start at the dawn of your civilization with a small city and build up over thousands of years to forge an empire spanning across sea and land. wage wars or play it safe and let others do your fighting for you via diplomacy. the gameplay is rich and deep with many different civs and units and a long tech tree to research new technology. each game is different and provides unlimited replayability. the game becomes much more and generally a better experience with the added expansions, and i wouldnt recommend playing it without them but, the whole set can come at a price. overall i highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone should have it in there game library.",311.8

"i originally got into civilization back when civilization revolution was free with games with gold on the 360. i decided to try it out, and loved it. ive wasted so many hours on that game, and i regret none of it. then, i find out that the game is part of a series. i can say that the discovery of civ 5 can only be equated to that of a divine revelation. i decided to get the complete edition when it was on sale, and the next thing i knew, i was obsessed and terrified of beloved historical leaders. the game is very well made, and not too difficult to learn how to play. after a game or two, i got the hang of things, discovered how to use trade routes and religions and such. so much time has been spent on this game. 10/10 would recommend. good gameplay, not too difficult to play, fun mechanics, hours upon hours of play.",93.3

"i have the complete edition which i got on sale, and i really must say: great game. is it a game? is it a simulator? either way the intricacy, the depth, the characters, the realism is/are fantastic. for a number of years i had passed over societal/national simulators because none of them had the detail and intricacy necessary for bringing realism to the social/political interactions between nations. this one does a good job with that, and im impressed. my only caveat is that the ai is sometimes really dumb. otherwise its one of the best games ever made, i think: 9/10.",165.8
"i can see im going to have countless hours of enjoyment from this game.",24.0
"this game is recomended it is very fun but if you have a bad computer steer clear of multiplayer and if really bad dont buy the game till you get a better computer (trust me ik) over all pretty fun gme i believe it is worth time into it",20.5

"9/10 best rts game i have played. i like how it goes through all of time into the modern era. so basically, you go from killing with spears, to f*cking nukes. it has very minor flaws which are not worth pointing out because they do not effect the overall experience. in conclusion, it is amazing for its intelligent way of having the player build the idel nation to their liking, no matter the leader you pick.",35.0
"you ask yourself if you should buy this game. you buy this game based on a reccomendation. you open game. then the next twelve hours of your life on gone, never to be seen again.",12.5
"worked my way from 2000 bc to 1950 ad. proceeded to research nukes. completed manhattan project. denounced by ghandi the next turn. 5 turns later... 2 cities destroyed. farmlands ruined. lives destroyed. bent the warmongering scum over backwards. 10/10 would nuke ghandi again",99.1
"i like...simply..............everything.........................",80.0
"great game, recommend it because its free. main issue is how slowly you earn certs to get better equipment to get more certs.",192.3
"definitley buy the brave new world dlc with this to enhance and add many new mechanics missing but even the base game is very addicting. you will yell at yourself to stop playing yet will always succumb to one more turn. great strategy game from my favorite strategy franchise of all time.",57.0

"awesome! best civ ever. hex tactics are great and not stacking units is so much more tactical.",597.9
"this game is probably my favourite game of all time. playing it alone is great, but playing it with your friends is amazing. not many games can give the civ v feel of backstabbing your friends and taking over their cities.",116.2

"civ v is a major upgrade in the civilization franchise. if you liked any of the other civilizations, you definitely need to buy this one. worth every penny! note: dlc is pricey, wait for a sale. the game is only half complete without its dlc (brave new world and gods and kings).",122.8
"this game is amazing. i started a round at default settings (on the largest sized map though, of course). its been 11 and a half hours, and im still not done. ive maybe conquered 15% of the world. the amount of gameplay in this game is rediculous (a round could maybe even get up to 50-75 hours single player) and the strategic possibilities are infinite. best strategy game ive ever bought, and well worth your money.",133.8

"i cant help but try to win with a domination victory everytime i play this game. what is wrong with me....",229.8
"great single player game, or multiplayer game! with multiple choices on characters, packed with loads to discover and enjoy. the turn based gameplay is a little hard to get used to, but once you do it comes naturally. weather youre a lone player or someone who plays together with friends, this game is great for you! 10-10",27.6
"the greatest strategy game of all time. the best of the series. beautiful, educational and great fun.",61.3
"i had heard of all the civilization games and how good they were, but had never gotten around to buying one. finally decided to buy this one and i dont regret it. perhaps one of the pinnacles of strategy games! to have the ability of creating a civilization and making it grow is priceless! this is a must have game! 5/5",20.4
"i started playing today and already 11 hours in thats how much i love this game. it took me some time to learn the basics since ive never played a game like this before, i havent really played any stratagy games so this is my first one and i really enjoy it.",31.5

"my likings for different games has come and gone, but the one constant that i always fall back to is civ. its just an awesome game.",153.5
"your empire is prospering. you just spent your last 100 turns killing the barbarian scum. you have been friendly with the other nations, but that is over now, the arabs have the lowest points, so you attack them thinking that you are oh so clever. as soon as you step on their soil an army the size of your entire population comes over the ocean. you quickly try to make peace, but alas, it is all too late. you go straight into military production, pumping out as many units as you can, but suddenly you see on your screen greece has declared war on you. your friend who spawned halfway across the globe can only watch as you nation is ransacked, tears stream down your eyes, for you have just wasted 14 hours of you life. 10/10 would do it again",54.5
"i love this game!!! i dont care if you dont like stratigy games or not this game is a work of art. it is very exspansive. even without the brave new world exspaniton dlc this game is gigantic. when i first picked up this game on steam i wasnt very hot on the idea of turned based stratigy. oh but was i wrong. this game opened my eyes to the turned base stratigy games. it alawed me to exsperience amazing tittles like this one. i also love the modding community. they make mods for the elder scrolls races to over powered units. there really are some great ideas for this games workshop out there. i just wanted to wright this quick review over this tittle to show my thanks to the devoplers of this game for making a quite perfect game.",87.3
"gandhi was a glitch. the creators accidently set him to top aggressiveness rather than the lowest, like they meant to. that is why his aggressiveness is so high. however, amazing game. completely recommend it. 100/10",136.5
"this is the game that you open early in the afternoon, play for a few minutes, and realize you literally spent 6 hours playing civ. its insane how this game seems to bend time, its just so absorbing and fun. easy to learn, tons of replayability.",80.2
"i would highley reccommend this game if you are into grand strategy games",78.3
"now with all the dlcs, etc. i consider this game to be the best civilization game, and arguably the best turn based strategy game ever built. there is not another game out there with such diversity of concepts, and depth of play strategy.",543.3
"great game, could probably play this game until i die, the replay value is probably the best in any game i have ever played.",476.9
"i havent had enough time to fully complete the game, however im already addicted to taking over city states and watching my civilization grow. if you want a game where you want to waste some time away, then this game is perfect for you. highly recommend it. 10/10. 12/10 with rice.",28.1

"this game is the most addicting game i have ever played. warning do not enter if you plan to be out anytime soon.",23.2
"a very fun, time consuming game, rounds can take hours, and thus spread over days to play, be prepared for that. the base game on its own is very strong already, but i believe all the dlcs are quite the enrichment to the gameplay (especially the two big ones, brave new worlds and god and kings, also the ones that add more factions).",56.7
"i think im addicted... too much fun! love sid meier games.",29.2
"ive played civilization games as long as i have enjoyed strategy games. i would say that on many fields, civilization 5 is better than the pretty dominant civilization 4, that i had enjoyed for many years. civilization 5 introduces new mechanics into the already established game, without breaking the good habit from earlier games. the haxagonal map works well and new tactics are introduced when the stacks of doom no longer exist. welcome to fast travelling days of playing pious boudicca, warmongering shaka or cultural pedro of brazil. just one more turn...",588.1

"this is a great game. that i got for free with all dlc from a friend and all i had to do to pay them back was play one round were i was nuked by gandi 10/10 would get for free and get nuked by the most peaceful man that ever existed again. p.s. you have been denounced.",101.2

"got in this love/hate relationship with poland. i planned to spread islam to all four corners of the world, and yet he kept converting my cities. i was about to denounce him, but he kept coming up to me with lucrative offers and helped me fight attila. i wanted to hate attila for taking my goldmine with his great general, but my culture dominated his and i felt that hes like a brother to me. plus his army is huge. i ended up losing because of my indecisiveness. 10/10 would get into an abusive relationship again",30.1
"youll like it until ghandi becomes a nuke-happy warmongering tyrant and decides to kills everyone with his giant death robots...",172.6
"amazing strategy game, increcibly adaptable to any play style, excellent multiplayer adaptability, and it doesnt get old once you beat it. you simply can replay the game again and again and it will never be the same thing twice. i would highly reccomend this game along with all of its dlcs.",160.3
"ive played this game for a while, but only recently have i decided to get it on steam. im not going to say a huge amount, seeing as other reviews sum the game up pretty well. this game is great with all of the dlcs. personally, i find the game alone to be lacking, but if you buy the complete edition during a steam sale (approx 10/$15), you can gather up some friends and then ruin your relationship by nuking them 500 turns into a game. the game is addicting as all hell. its got a sort of a one more turn mentality which makes you play way longer than you should and ultimately results in you failing to accomplish anything productive in life. tl;dr -  gandhi, play with friends, destroy your life.",99.5
"you know what? i love civ games, but this one finally pissed me off. the hords of dlc is matched only by the shocking price if you didnt buy it all in one go. what a shameless repulsive way to make money with these  little micro-transactions - individual civilizations can be purchased like collection of ing pokemon as long as you are stupid enough to pay the money, and you even have to pay... for map packs. thats right, something you could make as free dlc from the steam workshop now has to be paid for. they have literally chosen a bunch of great features of civ 4, taken them out of the game, and made you pay for them.  you 2k...",66.0
"a great game, but pretty b ullshit for one main reason: dlc; expansion packs which actually make the game worth playing, is priced at 40quid (20 for each). thats 5 quid more than the complete edition. this means that people who bought the original base game are now shafted. this price point is unacceptable and 2k should suck my knackers",138.9

"its fun, can be challenging at higher levels if your not on your game for real. would recommend.",198.6
"absolutely awesome game! but dont get it on steam. after civ: beyond earth came out, civ v started crashing when setting up a new game. i couldnt find a way to stop steam from updating to the buggy new version, so getting it on dvd is probably the best way to get a working version of this game, i downloaded an old version and its working perfectly (as long as steam is turned off)",956.9
"this game is really addicting, the first 5 minutes i got hooked",25.4
"this game is just great, one of the bests ever made.",296.8
"amazing game and i absolutely love it. the only reason i say no is because they wont let you upgrade to the complete edition and instead make you rebuy the game and i dont have that kind of cash to splash, which really sucks cause the dlc looks amazing.",73.8
"easily one of the best games you can get on pc. im usually a much bigger fan of rts, but this turn-based strategy game is truly wonderful and ive logged something like 300 hours playing it already.",280.2
"i could write an immense review of this game, stating why it has caused me more sleepless hours than anything in my library other than kerbal space program. but its pointless. if youre even looking at turn-based-strategy games, you probably already know exactly what to expect from civilization v. some hardcore strategy types might consider it lightweight...but ive been one of those people, and if you end up talking with a grognard type who says they think the civilization series, any of them, were bad games, theyre either a hipster of the worst sort or just plain lying. buy this game.",21.0

"gandhi accepts peace agreement 2 turns later nuclear war.... 10/10 would play gandhi again",111.2
"i have followed the civilization games with fervor. when i originally bought this, i was floored. with the expansions, i had to change my entire style of play. i wont lie that upset me at first, but i have grown to enjoy the added challenge. inability to unit stack may seem like a pain, but it creates the need to strategize instead of just overpower.",651.9
"still getting to know the game, will post a better review after a couple hundred more hours.",482.7
"this game will eat your time. if you like turn based games or want an amazing time killer, grab civ 5! it feels amazing to build up a nation of nothing and win in more than just the traditional military way. play this with a friend its even better! ill be on this one for a while.",51.8

"10/10 -great graphics -great gameplay -advenced replayability just some cons: -could take a while to learn, i would suggest playing with someone or looking at gameplay on youtube, the in-game tutorial isnt great -need a pretty good computer to run flawlessly.",100.3
"this is an absolutely fantastic game. i would reccomend it to anyone who likes an rts or even a city management game. it has elements which make it great for rts players, such as the war mechanics, but also has city building and citizen management. overall a great game. 10/10",73.8
"sid meiers civilization v is such a great game for people who love history strategy games and well just fun with friends. this game you got to be ready from turn one and make every move perfect. this is probaly a bad review and im not describing it well and you need the dlc very badly it makes the game super fun so yea first review civ 5 great game",336.7
"best civilization game out yet, beyond earth is good but in this game you go throughout the years and your troops can change due to the era you are in such as industrial era and modern era. this is hands down the best clivilization game ive played. i highly recommend this game.",67.2
"pretty much any thing that has a sid meiers label on it, i love. the only problem i have with this game is that one dlc costs as much as the entire original game. i know i could buy the complete edition, but it hardly seems fair that i have to pay for the game twice just to get a decent deal on the dlc. you should think about pro-rating the prices of the dlc to match that of the complete edition (i.e. make the major dlc content 10 bucks each at most), especially considering that beyond earth just came out.",139.9
"if you feel like wasting away countless hours of your life, buy this game. i could play this game for 168 hours straight if i had the time.",185.6
"very good game, its really worth purchasing (specially into any discount for the complete edition). excellent to play with your friends and amazingly enjoyable while single player.",68.2

"if you like games that are nice and quick, then leave, you probably fail at life due to impatience too. you are reading the review of a player who has spent 300+ hours playing this game. thats probably twenty times longer than all the time it took u.s. congress to actually do something productive! not to mention the fact that you can name your religion aids and sooner or later youll recieve a notice that the citizens of kathmandu wants said aids. remember kids, its not what kathmandu can do for you, its what you can do for kathmandu. 10/10 would give kathmandu aids again.",442.8

"this game was amazing, i played it when i did not have much to do on certain day, even vanilla was very fullfilling and exciting. though it has bugs and its hard to run on older pc, it is still a blast with the amazing soundtrack the top notch strategy gameplay and its overall ability to be a game.",182.7
"if youre looking for a game that will make you think, strategize, and adapt, youve found it. civilization 5 is easily one of the best strategy games ive ever played, and it never seems to get old. no two sessions are alike, especially if you choose to play multiplayer. the game is already fun and immersive, but when playing with a friend or two, whether youre progressing together, or fighting for superiority, the entertainment value doubles. if you enjoy turn based strategy games, give this a try; it has unlimited replayability, and i guarantee youll enjoy it. also you can nuke stuff. buy it.",101.4
"ive had a lof of fun with the game so far, although id be happier if factions had more than one choice of ruler and the introductions didnt take so long. still, if youve got a few hundred hours of your life that need filling, this is a pretty good choice.",221.4
"best turn based strategy game ive played, has a mix of everything that most strategists probaly like if they like games like hearts of iron and europa universalis 4, but want a turned bas alternative,",137.4
"one of my all time favorite games! the only thing i could say would be something they really need to work on is the ai. the ai is very bland and often makes choices that dont make any sense.",626.8

"amazing game. ai are always unpredictable. 10/10 potatoes.",26.5
"i grew up loving real-time strategy games such as age of empires, warcraft, knights & merchants and rise of nations. my first impressions when i tried the turn-based civilization v (when it came out) was extremely negative. i was off by how the level looked like a board game and how everything depended on number of turns, even for soldiers. however, everything changed once i finally understood how to play this game. to begin with, there is a high learning curve to understand how a civ match works. you will have to be patient in the beginning of the game, where you build your civilization. once thats out of the way, the fun starts! the way you do politics, agreements and war is very interesting and it actually simulates a board game. so if you love board games, you gotta buy this one.",56.0
