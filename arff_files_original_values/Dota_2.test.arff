"pretty good moba in my opinion. free to play, which is good because otherwise i probably would not have gotten into the realm of mobas in the first place. the learning curve can be pretty daunting at first, so i would recommend that you get a friend to help you learn the basics. 9/10 pros: solid multiplayer, large character selection, fun rpg elements, gameplay never gets boring cons: steeper learning curve, will need to learn jargon",54.0

"best moba in my opinion. although the game is not fully done yet, but it is alive due to great updates almost every day. the balance between heroes is very good, skill matters also. but the game vs real players, not bots, is very hard on my opinion and needs to be balanced, so professional players will not play with newbies. i recommend it to everyone, who like moba games and good graphics, friendly interface and cooperating.",619.5

"approaching 2100 hours played...wow. while i do completely agree with the reviews that talk about how bad the community is, i have to say my experience of dota on the whole has been very enjoyable. the mute option is great, i insta-mute anyone talking crap. admittedly dota has an incredibly high learning curve, and you will often find high level players playing on noob accounts so even the early matches for new players can be brutal. if you can push through the first couple of hundred hours of games ;) and ignore the torrent of expletives thrown your way when you let the team down!; you will find dota 2 to be a: competitive, intense, challenging, and completely engaging experience.",2380.1
"once you get past the vertical wall of a difficulty spike, this game becomes one of the funnest things you can play for free.",868.0
"comment: good game, enticing for those intrigued by tactics and decision making. has a steep learning curve, however once over the initial bump the game sails smoothly. with over 500 hours there is still so much to learn and understand regarding gameplay and dynamics. ____________________________________________________________________________________ rating: 8.5/10 ____________________________________________________________________________________",1367.7

"nowhere near as cool as league of legends. i mean, you get all the heroes for free? what kind of stupid game designer implements that? also, this game is clearly a copy of lol. forget the fact that the original dota was made way before league of legends.",1508.8

"its a great game. i highly recommend it because of the amount of variety. it gives you over 50.. no.. over 100 combinations of characters and items to use in battle. in dota 2 you rely both on strategy and strength, and in some cases, even teamwork. but there are some few drawbacks, for example, theres only 1 map and finding an online game in some regions takes several minutes. ( or at least, that is my case ). but still, the design of characters, effects and models, compared to the ones from dota 1, are fascinating. i really like the new heroes look. plus, its not like you really have to pay for useful weapons and items. you can buy things in-game, in map shops to strengthen your hero, and even your team. i really give this game a high ranking!",20.4

"way way way more depth than league of legend (lol), steeper learning curve, higher skill cap and alot more balancing / fair play. has some similarities to hon but overall feels like a really different game. i love both but dota 2 feels more competitive and has a bit more interesting heroes + the balancing is better (except riki). i would recommend this game if youre into something that requires you to actually think and use your brain unlike lol. i personally prefer hon out of all the mobas but that might just be cause i started with it, dota 2 comes close as second. 9/10",1278.8
"this game improved so much since it was released on the beta. there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1. i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers. i know some people who play lol might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. its like comparing cod and battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",1546.3
