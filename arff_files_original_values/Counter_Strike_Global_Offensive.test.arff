"counter strke global offensive is a great addition to the series, with new gameplay modes and a new variaty of weapons, as well as customization. the game is really hard, especially for new people. for others who have played the cs games, it should fell the same, but a little different. many of the guns from the old games have returned as well as dissapeared. (bring back the mp5 or have it replace the mp7). overall, counter strike global offensive recives (for me) a 8/10. score: 8/10 pros: -new guns -better graphics -new gameplay modes -customization cons: -recoil is hard to get use to",142.7
"one of the best shooters out there if not the best. the game has a high learning curve and good number of game modes and maps. very addictive gameplay; 5 stars.",980.3
"this game drives people mad and has toxic community. im 100% done with this game update: not exactly 100% done with it but i still find this game repulsive. in fact, i have to do admit that i like this game but the community itself is horrible.",725.4
"i will compare this game with cs 1.6, because that game is like little brother of cs:go. pros: + better maps and models + good graphics + weapons have skins + more types of game (casual, demolition,...) + automatic server finder + marketable items + updates with new items cons: - expensive updates score: 10/10.",126.5
"a game that let you wear mask as counter-terrorist to prevent spreading ebola from terrorists. 10/10 would play again.",1000.5
"its still a counter strike, but theres a few things that should be changed. this game should be about holding angles, not about checking corners. map designs should be similar to cs 1.6 maps. second thing, the flashes should be way more effective, as if you turn around you barely get flashed, while in css or cs 1.6 your screen would actually be a lot brighter than in this game. third thing, quick-scoping with awp is so random now, unlike in 1.6 where it is perfect as it should be. fourth and final thing, the deagle: it costs 800$ and you can get p250, which is way more useful, for 300$. deagle should have the same specifications as it had in previous counter strike games, because then those 800$ would be worth of spending.",1703.2
"this game is awesome online works great and i love competative mode you should play it if you like a good fps",712.0
"great game when things are going your way! (connection, good team mates that listen.)",98.8
"99% of the time youll meet some mic talking people they are gonna be russian",140.8
"this game is love, this game is life unfortunately its never ogre",755.8
"this is a great team game. if you have four friends, and you want something to do to pass 30-60 minutes, then go play competitive mode, which will put you with people of similar skill level using a ranking system. it has better graphics(which i doubt anyone really cares about but its nice,) it has new weapons from cs:s, it keep bunnyhopping, (but its much more difficult) and its an all around great team game. i definitely recommend it as it has stolen 800 hours from my life as of writing this. edit: at 1,200 hours taken away from me, its amazing ;w; edit 2: my friend killled the last guy, he found an awp, i tkd him because i wanted it, the whole time he was screaming nonononono and i picked it up and he yelled whyyyyyyy and i said i wanted it and then he asked for it back and i walked to my site to watch and he tked me and got banned, i swapped to the bot to find the awp, my other friend went to go get it, i killed him and got banned rip 1.5k hours",1560.2
"moderate learning curve for those who have never played any cs games before, but highly rewarding once you start to learn",205.7
"this game is truly a masterpiece; it provides hours of fun weather you are playing alone or with friends. it has a competitve stage for people who really just want to play to win and there are tons of community servers with different mods and gamemodes. the game also has skins, which change the appearence of you weapons in game. you can get these skins by random chance at the end of each game or open up boxes for a chance at different skins for a fee; these skins can then be sold on the steam market for real money or traded for other skins. while this game is amazing it also has its cons; there is a notable amount of hackers in the game, even though valve is trying its best to keep them out of the game they are still there. but that is the main con, of course the game has some glitches here and there but the hackers are really the main issue. even with its cons this game is really amazing. 9/10",740.4
"amazing game, lots of fun. but i dont like the 64 tick on most servers tho.",263.9
"awsome game. alot of people smurf but its still fun",988.3
"9/10, one of the best casual games i have ever played.",512.4
"the game is very nervous when you play against hackers :)",221.4
"this game is a great fps better than call of duty in some ways",26.2
"you spend more money on weapon skins than the game itself to impress people you hate. chickens explode if you knife them 9/11",889.2
"slightly updated graphics from the previous version of counter-strike. would recommend if you have any interst in playing cs. upgrades to servers, ability to find match, and much more.",259.4
"counter-strike: global offensive is a first person shooter game that takes immense skill, which i do not have. however even if you are a terrible player, cs: go allows you to still call other players noob or pleb. this is what makes cs: go a magnificent work of art. however, you cannot slay donkeys with swords (though you can slay chickens with knives).",704.1
"this is probably the best shooter ever made. cs:go has anything that was in the previous versions of cs, plus it adds awesome skins and item drops like crates. if youre lucky enough you can get rare items dropped, which you then can sell on the market. that being said, you not only have an awesome shooter with millions of maps, plenty game mods and brilliant matchmaking. in cs:go you also have a cash-cow. go idling, milk the cow, if youre lucky youll get an awp skin. or a knife model. in that case, you can quit your job and lay back.",347.5
"the only bad thing about it is that everyone else is better than you. and that those people are likely to be  about it. and theyll most probably be using an awp (a one shot sniper pretty much anywhere in the body). but other than that its cool.",121.1
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",76.6
"love the game.. a lot of changes though compare to the last one ive played before but its ok.. !! =)",115.5
"this game is too good use to be a 1.6 fan still am but now im just hooked on go..",1110.3
"a very realistic game that teaches you the importance of aiming in fps!",642.6
"its awsome but if they clean the hacks it will be over power ^_^",96.0
"booted up the game. got shot in the face. little kid said that i suck and then insinuated he had sexual relations with my mother. 10/10.",104.4
"you can shoot people, and be a snob about it because it isnt call of duty. 12/9",70.8
"much like its predicessor, cs:go is a groundbreaking addition to the fps genre, the realistic simulation of weapon physics and military sop such as, but not limited to, rank;units;chain of command; team and leadership skills. like most autistic children, i have a deep, almost sexual love for stickers and colorful patterns so when i see a game with both for guns, i had a light heart attack. as for suggestions and complaints, i dont really have any... other than it hasnt really changed since condition zero... the awp needs to be nerfed, people keep getting rekt... the matchmaking was made by the antichrist...perhaps make it with prerendered loadouts like a cod game... overall, id say i was globally offended 10/10",149.9
"first 5 minutes of this game made me go back 8 years in the past and put a huge smile on my face :) feels like all of the ,,good stuff,, in cs 1.6 made it into this game.im just full of joy for getting it and you should too :d",28.7
"for the fps lovers, im sure that you will really like this game. if you have already played the old versions of counter-strike before, then you will be amazed by the graphics of cs: go. the buy menu is better than the old one. it has an additional items like the molotov, decoy grenade and etc. the maps are also better than the previous versions of cs. so, go to the steam store and buy it now!",318.6
"amazing tactical fps with a lot of depth to it. for everyone who is bored of the average running and gunning, cs really steps it up. anyone can point and click, but in cs u get to deal with challenges such as recoil control, flashbangs, tactical smokes and more. there is an amazing competitive scene, and the esports in this game is booming bigger than ever. besides all these amazing features, the game has a very high skill ceiling, and is challenging enough on its own without the need for any yoloscope360 non-sense. for the price, this is a must have. the game has many game modes which will allow u to get more then plenty value out of it, even when u dont enjoy the competitive side of it. i recommend this game.",46.9
"if like u toally wan to pwn som noob s, like... go buy htis gaem cus if u dont.. like ur a toal noob, why dont u let ur mum play teh gaem then ?",29.1
"awesome game just feel like it needs a pause function ingame",1138.7

"11/10 one of the best game i have played.this is not something like cod where u go pew pew and win the match.here you need teamwork to actually do something.this game is all about teamwork.also its an must buy!",42.3
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",76.6
"this is a great game :) much better than source was as an predecessor to cs 1.6. this is worth being called the predecessor source wasnt :d",140.3
"i have been following counter-stike since the start. i will always support them because not one game that they have relesed is bad. they are always good. 5 out of 5",39.8
"if you enjoy watching your teammates play the game for you while your limp dead body sits there on the ground or enjoy loading into servers for hours on end i can assure you this is a great investment. otherwise, this game sucks.",41.6
"another solid installement in counter strike serie. takes whats best from 1.6 and source and makes a solid foundation for esports scene for years to come. a must buy.",248.5
"well, this game has some pluses & minuses im going to mention below: pluses: + very competitive & challenging online game for shooter lovers; + big variety of weapons; + got lots of weapon skins which you can trade/sell; + additional missions which gives you rewards after completion; minuses: - only few weapons have aiming/zooming availability; - damage system is bad (you can empty whole magazine to an opponent on the chest & he still may stay alive); - graphics aint that good for 2012; - very strict rules in competitive mode (especially leaving the match penalty. it gonna give you cooldown even if you get disconnected from the game due to error & you cant fix it in 3 minutes. cooldowns may be from 30 minutes to 7 days); all in all, i dont see other alternatives of this game in this genre & despite all its minuses i mentioned above, it still remains one of the most played game in my list.",687.0
"so...many...headshots... so...many...knifes... also scared of corners and doors left ajar. pls send backup",169.3
"good game you shoot people, shooting is fun, when you shoot it comes blood. sometimes they shoot you then you bleed. wise tip : if someone shoots you young padawan blame lag or hacks",773.7

"highly competive and high learning curve. dont even bother playing casual tho filled with trolls and people who think theyre playing cod. really good game once you get into it!",380.0
"i would probably say the best fps of all time. this game has been around since 1999 and has evolved into this.",231.4

"this is a very fun game especially when you have a friend to play with you.",855.5

"i highly suggest this game if you enjoy countering the strikes or various similar actvities.",649.3
"great fps and even better that it has camos. takes a while to get used to, but probably the best fps game i have ever played.",506.9
"i bought a weapon skin that is worth more than the game itself. 10/10",641.8
"counter-strike: global offensive (cs: go) released on 2012 by valve! it will expand upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 12 years ago. many things updated graphics, physics, sounds, maps, and some mods added! cs:go has a very competitive style and all maps are made for competitive style! added a very usefull rank systeam! can play on almost all pcs score by metacritic 83/100 my score 94/100",381.3
"i have fully enjoyed this game. it is fun to play and slightly addicting. i would reccomend this game to everyone who has played mobas like league of legends and dota2.",337.2
"counter-strike:source ...but with purrdier graffics n guns dat count ur kills 13.4/10",106.2
"many good geme but bullet no go where i shot pls how do shoot and scope",880.3
"this game is fantastic, ive played about 48 hours and i just love it. its nearly impossible to get kills when you first start, this is because its such an addicting game, people play it for ages. i love it as a player who has never played any other counter strike. if you have not played any counter strike, i am tellingyou to buy this bloody great game! if u have played counter strike, then i cant say to u cause you would be more experienced than me",932.7
"this game is pure gold. pros -original gameplay -new buy menu for quick access -skins -new maps -workshop! cons -crates & keys overview all in all, this lives up to the original games just as well. it has everything all the same, but with new maps and skins and workshop compatability, this game is just endless! tons of acheivements to rack up your ranking and competitive games to give you a rush of adrenaline, cs:go is just one of those games you have to play and love. the only problem i feel with this game is crates and keys. it feels a lot like it is following tf2 in its footsteps. it really feels like you could be better at how you play and acheive which makes the game feel more like a bully to you than anything.",574.5
"this is one of those games that require studying the weapons and characteristics to be successful. it has a big learning curve but once you get it, you have a lot of fun playing it. its fantastic even though a couple things like graphics are a little out of date. if i could choose one this for them to work on in the next game it would be improving the textures and with that comes better optimization. in my mind it is a 8/10 on the multiplayer scale.",594.2
"excellent game, recommend to anyone whose parents are ok with blood nothing too inappropriate except the overuse of blood stains on walls, and some of the players are profane, but all online games are like that.",178.9
"this game is pretty good, until you realize your friend had to give up his ak-47 blue laminate and usp guardian just to re buy you the game.",85.7
"this game is: 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain 100% reason to purchase this game",1213.8
"its yop season and errbody getting caught with no coats",456.8
"really great fps game that is good for almost anyone. its not pay to win and is purely on skill level.",972.6
"this game is good. i have learned over 1,000 russian words more than i would ever learn in school. this game teaches you that buying $200+ knives is cool. it teaches you that team work and calling someone a ing  for missing a shot. it teaches you that it is okay to invest thousands of dollars into a game worth $15. overall, this game teaches you many things. 10/10 would let my future children play.",316.8
"if you want to spend $400 on a red knife that gives you no advantage in the game, heres the game for you!",265.9
"this game is absolutely amazing. buy it now. say goodbye to any thought of sleep.",90.7

"plenty of fun, very competitive and interesting would recommend for the price!",614.0
"9/10 screaming russians and 12 year old kids :p good combo between tactics and skill. awesome game.",119.6
"counter strike: global offensive is a good fps game that may be hard at first especially if it is your first fps game. there are a few reasons it is hard, i find it hard because it is difficult for me to aim with no iron or attached sights because i am used to call of duty. it is also difficult to learn the different spray patterns of the guns that are available for use. there are a lot of things that you can learn ingame by hours and hours of playing, i mean i have played 800+ hours and i still cant use the ak properly xd. i definitely recommend that people give this game a go, i have enjoyed my experience so far.",1403.3
"cs go is an amazing addition to the counter-strike catalog. im a long time player and fan of cs and half-life, playing 1.6, cz, source and now go. i think with all the additions of skins and trading cards mixed with the updated graphics and maps makes this the best cs to date. i love how they include new map updates and new skins frequently. overall it is a great buy for $14.99 and a worthy addition to anyones steam library.",383.5

"everybody yells at me to do  that i dont understand. they tell me to do stuff i dont like. it makes me uncomfortable. they stick things in my- oh. im writing a review for csgo? i thought it was a review for that one time in florida. its a good game.",4.0

"if you hate russians, then this is the perfect game to show them how much you hate them.",769.8
"i started playing cs 1.6 years ago. till this day, cs remains the 1 game that i find myself always coming back to for a little bit. nothing has really changed, and yet a lot has really changed, if that makes sense. cs go is a win. dont think twice about playing if youve been a fan. this game is fun",338.6

"i do not have a lot of hours on this game, but from playing css and cs 1.6 i can say they have done an outstanding job. i love counter strike and will always love the game, people care about graphics pfffft, it is all about gameplay and this game has it. it is 1000x better than cod and all other first person shooter, if you are looking for a game that will bring a lot of fun to you this is the game to get. once you get into it, you can never stop playing from how fun the game is, best gameplay, best first person shooter and i strongly recommend this game.",386.4
"big fan of cs games right back to 1.6, go is a breath of fresh air in the cs saga a must play for any true fps fan",193.8
"dont buy this game if you are a casual gamer that does not enjoy spending money on virtual gun skins and boxes of pure misery. well i do enjoy this kind of games, so i guess ive already blown off quite a bit of money on it already, and more is to be dropped into gabes wallet. if you play in europe, there is a big chance that you will be queued up with russians. they tend to only speak russian to you, and nothing else which is kind of annoying. i do find the game itself quite entertaining and frustrating at the same time, but i do reccomend it if you are into 1st person shooters where the hackers are almost non-existant. i r8 8/8",707.2

"only have 50hours+ but so far this is the best fps out there. it beats cod and battlefield just the community on there brings rewards from its self. i would really recommend this to my friends and to everyone if they are into fps. plus ive been a counterstike kid since 2005 now its 2014 and the love is still here for the cs community. keep the game the way its suppost to be :) : >5stars< edit: its been over 400 hours now and still satified",1359.2

"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",213.0
"best competitive fps. its fun, challenging and exciting, especially if you play matchmaking because you and your team are playing for the same goal and you are doing it together. if your team wins the satisfaction is much bigger than winning in other fpss (e.g. cod and bf (not saying they are not fun)).",619.1

"this game is not really as bad as you would think. it does infact have alot of ups and downs compared to source. for beginners, this actually have a high playerbase and the graphics are improved, and im starting to enjoy it more and more. + * compeditive gameplay. where you get banned for leaving early and stuff * it have various communitymaps, and the biggest focus is on non-dedicated servers - * way to much focus on skins, its easy to spend too much on something that in reality have no value * people who play competidive might be mean as f if youre not a world champion at the game * the skins you want cost 1000 dollars i will give the game a solid 7/10 at this moment, but it might change later on",466.9

"hey, i am just curious if anyone else does this. every day when i take a shower, i like to turn the water super hot, hold my nuts in my hand and let the scalding hot water run over them. lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason, so instead of itching them, i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation ive ever felt in my life. it feels amazing and im doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. i just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. as ive been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working. i know its weird but im telling you it feels incredible. im not saying other people should try it, but if youve got an itch, perhaps a better alternative is to burn them with scalding hot water. posted: 19 april 2014",859.8

"counter strike: global offensive (otherwise known as cs:go) is the newest game in the counter strike series. since ive already done a review of counter strike: source, im just going to talk about the many gameplay changes that go introduces to the series. firstly, the guns all have more kick to them, making run-n-gun players hugely greivanced. the guns all feel authentic and sound amazing, but i personally dont enjoy using the snipers and i cant stand the heavy weapons (i.e. miniguns). the weight of each gun has been pretty drastically increased, leaving slower and more methodical gameplay in its path. if you remember cs:s, there a probably 2 things you noticed: 1. there were very few shotguns, and 2. there were only two grenade types. well, in go, there are now 5 types of shotgun, and 4 different types of grenades! i personally believe is the best game in the counter strike series, and its methodical gameplay makes for a difficult experience, for both newcomers, and seasoned veterans.",15.2

"good game, sharp learning curve, competitive aspect is probably one of the best alongside lol, dota. casuals tend to be somewhat cancer with low rank players who mic spam and flame. however most people arent cancerous. nice community. every 3-4 games you will run into a hacker in competitive, and in the higher ranks of eagle + every 1-2 games you might have a hacker. sometimes you will run into toxic players, flaming you for small things, mute them and go on with life. many players in competitive games are toxic you dont have to deal with that person for an hour so mute him. tl;dr good game, good community except some toxic people, fun and competitive.",700.3

"the good points: cs:go isnt reinventing the wheel of first person shooters. if youve played any iteration of counter-strike over the years, youll find most of the content very familiar. that said, go adds enough to keep it interesting. all of the weapons feel unique and the variety of gameplay modes will mean endless hours of entertainment. the bad points: ive been playing video games for a long time and the cs:go community might be the worst ive ever dealt with. in addition to the run-of-the-mill trash talk, you can expect to be inundated with anti-semitic, racist, and/or homophobic slurs (ive heard some people use all three at a time to insult other players). i dont think ive ever heard someone say something insightful on the mic in all of the matches ive played. your best bet is to simply mute as many players as possible. all in all, a great game as long as you ignore what everyone says during a match.",33.5

"personaly, one of the best developed games created by valve.as you play deathmatch,casual,demolition,competetive,arms race, you earn ranks and learn how to become a cs go pro.but thats not all you can brose and take a look in the community based servers, which are sometimes recommended.(vac problems)(kinda). finnally you can buy 5 versions of counter strike for 29.99 wich is a huge amound of savings, because you get more for less. in conclusion this game supports many graphicvs cards. i mean i bought call of duty ghost and i cant even play it maybe tell the end of the month because it only supports graphic card with direct x 11. (ed till i get the money, well see if i like it more than cs go).",834.7

"death is a great teacher. failure in counter-strike: global offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldnt have done, and how you could have done better. counter-strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. growth is an important factor in global offensive, especially if youre coming into counter-strike fresh or after a sabbatical. this is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. if youre a call of duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. counter-strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. 10/10 ign",264.8

"who doesnt like counter-strike? thats a serious question! it was a bright, cold day in november, well i really dont remember the weather but it was nov. 8th when counter-strike first appeared as a retail purchase. over 13 years later, the series is still a success. counter strike: global offensive not only has an awesome subtitle but a nice community behind it. but ill get to that later. let me talk about how great this game is. simple, quick and realistic is what describes cs:go. it also looks great with the source engine, the game being the second using the engine. it blends the classic with the new. your favorite maps from previous games are back and prettier than ever. the community behind this mulltiplayer game is superb. valve truly knows how to work in-hand with their fans. this game comes equipped with steam workshop, where the people create items and customizations for others to enjoy. to close up, i must say get this game. its only 15 bucks and its totally worth it.",7.7

"excellent game, especially for the price. if youve played any of the previous cs games, itll be fairly easy to learn the mechanics. if this is your first ever cs game, you better play the weapons course and a couple of matches against bots before you jump into a pub thinking you can 360 no scope headshot everyone on the enemy team. they also added something that hasnt been in any previous cs games, which is weapons camos. the system is quite similar to tf2. after a game is over, you have a chance of getting a weapon skin or case. its a timed thing, so chances are youll only get one or two items every 7-8 games. at first i didnt like this update because stuff like this doesnt belong in cs. however, ive grown accustomed to it and have spent quite a bit of money on keys for various gun cases. if you have the emone, buy it. if you dont like it, then atleast you didnt break the bank.",1369.7

"such a great game; where can i start? first of all, cs:go is a fast paced game involving terrorist and counter terrorist teams. at no point will you find yourself bored in the middle of a match, because of how small the maps are. in classic mode you have about 3 minutes maximum of game time per round, just to give you a taste of the action. anyway, just buy it now",849.4

"in case youre unfamiliar, counter-strike is an entirely multiplayer experience. you can play offline against ai bots, but these are still merely simulating what its like to play online, rather than really giving you a single-player game. the good news is that this is as good as online team-based shooters get. in the traditional game mode, there are two types of matches and two tiers of play. casual level is for newer players and removes aspects like friendly fire and the need to purchase armor and ancillary items each round (more on that in a second). ranked level is the original style of cs, with all the realism settings enabled, but it also features a comprehensive skill-based ranking system to try to balance teams and place good players with other good players.",345.9

"this game is great and one of the best first person shooters of its generation. its emphasis on death keeps this shooter different from other shooters of a similar nature and what it loses in scale compared to games like battlefield it makes up in how much gravity you as an individual have on the match. the feeling of being the last one on your team has not been replicated in any other game i have ever played and the feeling of winning against skilled opponents is unrivaled. it happens to be one of those games that seems to never get old.",453.7

"i dont wanna hype this game even though i play it a lot. it has its positive and negative sides. something i really like for example is the possibility to easily create lobbies to play custom maps with friends without having the need to host a server. and besides the default gamemodes there are hundrets of custom gamemodes out there, you just need to search for them ;) also they try their best to balance the weapons and gameplay. ofc people complain about it but over time it will get better... for the negative side - i dont like the spawn-system for deathmatch. it feels as if there is no system at all but random respawns causing some heavy spawn-killing. also there are only vew default maps for arms race wich is kind a sad. in case you have no idea what counter-strike is be warned: this game has no health regeneration and you may not spray with any weapon (except p90 maybe) id rate 4/5",291.2

"my full review will be mentioned now: counter strike global offensive is a tactical multiplayer focused fps. you cannot aim just like any other cs game. accuracy is key when trying to get those mlg headshots. one shot to the head can end it for you with most guns, so staying in a group is advised. so if you like team based shooters, which require a steep learing curving. definitly pick this game up now and enjoy for many hours to be lost!",941.5

"counter-strike has always held a special place in my heart, so it may be hard to speak without bias. that being said, if you are looking for a competative first person shooter, this is your game. it is no call of duty where blood distorts your view, its no battlefield with explosions all around you, it is a highly refined competative first person shooter, the phrase easy to learn, hard to master could not apply anymore to this game, the controls are simple, the maps are easy to learn, but the tacticts, teamwork, recoil compensation, and economy are something that may take you years to master. the game has a huge competative scene with multiple tournaments with prize rewards in the hundreds of thousands every year. the difficulty of the game, and the rewarding feel of getting an ak-47 headshot are something that never go away, highly recommend 10/10.",1356.2

"its a good game, definitely a big step up from css which blew giant  compared to 1.6. the only complaint i have with this game is that once you get to badge or higher, the amount of blatant and toggling hackers that you see in matchmaking is ludicrously high and makes you not want to play. the system itself which tries to balance the teams usually fails miserably too, but thats nothing new in valve games, as evidenced by dota 2s horrendous matchmaking. decent game overall, has some glaring issues though like completely ineffective anti-cheat.",1612.3

"counter-strike:global offensive as a first person shooter with a total of 34 guns to choose from. if you want to you can purchase keys and crates from either the steam store or the community store or if youre lucky you could get a crate as a random drop. certain keys open certain crates and if you open a crate you can get one weapon per crate that you open. if youre lucky you could get something valuable like a knife which are worth $45+. there are also different conditions for each gun. factory new weapons usually look brand new, minimal wear weapons have a few scratches on them, field tested weapons are the average condition which have a few or more scratches and marks on them, well worn weapons have scratches and bigger marks of colour taken off of the gun and battle scarred weapons look near terrible. overall i rate this game a 10 out of 10 for all of the different things in the game.",1267.0

(edit 02/07/14) three weeks after being banned, i would have expected the ban system to have taken my ban to 30 minutes, however it is a 7 day ban, dont believe the lies cs:go flows out. you ban does not roll back in any form, there is no point in buying this game if you play competitive.",123.9

"counter-strike: global offensive (cs go) offers a simple, yet surprisingly fun approach to the fps genre. coming from battlefield 3 (which i find fun as well), i found cs go to be a refreshing alternative. while there isnt much variety in what weapon one is able to use compared to many other shooters, it does make it easier for the developers to ensure that gameplay is well balanced. the fact that it is so easy to find a match to jump into also helps to make cs go a great game. my only criticism is that you are not able to disable bots in private matches (either that, or i cant find the option to do so), when i sometimes want to play 1 vs 1 with a friend. *edit: you can disable bots using the bot_kick command ingame* overall, at the normal price of $14.99 usd, which is the price of some dlcs in many games, cs go is a great value game that is worth every cent, let alone its price during the many sales valve holds on steam.",21.6

"i recommend it is one of the best shooters i played",527.6
"cs: go stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longvity and variety. valve has not only updated the eshooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. this is counter-strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isnt a higher recommendation than that.",297.0
"if you have played any other games of the series, then you wont have a problem liking cs:go. the game is great. its not better than css or 1.6 but its still a counter-strike game and super fun! also if you are a competitive person, then thats the way to go.",945.8

"still the a good game that doesnt demand much. you play casually or competitively depending on how much time you would like to commit. the game is simple and the better part of it is that unlike much other shooter games, there is a lot to learn in skill mechanics but because of that, you can see improvements in your skills as you commit more time in the game. though this makes the game a bit harsh for beginners, but trust me, with experience and pratice, the game will open up as you climb through the different skill levels and eventually youd be into it.",913.5
"another valve-going-to-be-classic, very demanding skill-wise, potentially addictive , but also a blast and (occasionally ) rewarding. there are some issues with the server capacity because of the rapidly growing community, the valve anticheat-system (vac) is not on par with current skill enhancing programs and skins became more or less the main reason for many players to not abandon global offensive. if you like tactic-shooters and especially other cs-titles, the only thing in your way of enjoying this game is being prejudiced....(or fukd up servers volvo pls).

"this game will bring you alot of fun and hours played, ive played the first counterstrike 7 years ago. ive been a counter-strike fan since i first tried it out. ive got a total of 4000 hours in total of all the counter-strike games combined over my 7 years of service. this game is alot of fun and the operations are really great! if you feel like you dont hit, either become a better player by training your aim and reaction, or you could switch from valves standard 64 tick (64 updates per second) to a paid 128 tick server (costs if youre gonna do it the pro way, some free servers for it in the server browser). this game is very cheap and on some sales (which is common), it can cost around 3. thats the price you sell one or two cases for, which drops very common! this game is updated and maintained alot. this is a very good game and i support it to 100%.",661.1

"counter strike: global offensive is basically a very big update to counter strike: source. featuring much better graphics, gameplay, maps, etc. i really enjoy playing this game whether i win or lose matches. cs:go, in my opinion, is a much better alternative to call of duty. but, i was definitely not expecting valve to give cs:go the tf2 treatment, with the skins and items. today, you have knives going for about $200+, and thats just an outragous price for a virtual item. to see people are actually buying items and making money off of this game (and losing more) is just, wow. im personally not a fan of this, but i guess, it seemed to of worked out for valve in the long run. every time i see someone with an extremely expensive knife/skin, it kills me a little on the inside. cs:go is still a very fun game nonetheless, and would suggest it to anyone fond of strategic fps games. just, try not to spend too much money on these kind of games. sometimes, you dont even realize how much money youre spending on it.",244.8
