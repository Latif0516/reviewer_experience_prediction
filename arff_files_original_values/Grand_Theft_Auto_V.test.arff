"love this game!!! i watched the countdown timer until it was time to play! i like mmos and fps. this game combines the 2 i imagine ill be playing this one no life style for awhile. plenty of fun things to do and you can never get bored so many differernt things to do.",28.2

"this is fukken awesome game! please buy it! 1337/10",17.8
"a complete shambles from rockstar games. you would expect a lot more from rockstar. i thought they would have planned for success for this title on the pc, but instead we are left with thousands of people being unable to play the game. my particular case is due to rockstar having force linked my steam account that is linked to an incorrect social club account. i created a brand new account because i was having trouble retrieving my old social club details and was given a warning that if i tick the box, that there will be no return. i decided to wait and try to gather my old details. i got my old details, yay! but, guess what!? i didnt even click the box and it has been linked to the wrong account... clap, clap, clap sarcasm? youre god damn right. well done to whomever came up with the perma link steam cd key idea... pffft, i think you should at least receive a written warning from your employer. now give me my 39.99 back so i can buy another copy and moan about it all again. p.s. do not buy this game guys, they have completely screwed around with the background infrastructure and you will lose your 39.99... technically fraud, as you arent receving anything useable...",12.6
"super extrme bug- gta5 cant launch under nvidia graph card!!! omg...i waited like whole month and you telling me got a big bug??? refund my 59.99 rockstar!",14.2
"10/10 the delays were good cuz they gave us this amazing game 1000 hrs + incoming",30.7
"this game is just beautiful. everything looks stunning, especially the water and how the city looks at night. 10/10 this game is so much fun.",19.8
"after waiting for 2 years, i finally dont have to go outside anymore.",24.1
"i7 4790k gtx 970 8 gigs of ram game runs at like 15 fps, even at lowest settings.",0.7
"spent 100 dollars on this game only to realise ive played it before. this is now the third system i have played it on. still boring. wtf is wrong with me. hopefully mods can justify this purchase for me",82.1
"have been waiting for this game for almost 2 years. i was extremely excited. until yesterday, gta v social club ui kept crashing. i hope there is a fix for this asap. although this has been a frustrating many hours of installing and reinstalling but still no success, i rate the game 10/10 rockstar fix the errors that so many people are dealing with so we can play this game that we have been waiting years to play.",47.0
"i loved this game on the 360, but i love it even more now. the increase in graphics and fps makes the game so much more enjoyable, and the better controls (keybaord and mouse) make the gameplay much easier to use. there is also a lot more that has been added from the version i previously played also, increased amount of songs, increased amount of vehicles. the game is just absolutely amazing. 1000000000/10 for the pc release, shame it took nearly 2 years from the original release.",59.6
"i neet the minimum requirements and my game still runs like cow a-s-s",4.8
"so here i was expecting the game of a decade, then after a 60 gb download, with the anticipation mounting, bam the thing doesnt get past the decoding/updating screens. i demand a refund for this! it isnt early accses and its one year late. this is outragous! either fix the damn bugs or dont bother. i want my hard earned money back in my pocket. youve already ruided this customers satisfaction. dont do it for others. ive tried well over 100 times to launch the game, and tried these solutions to the windows account error to no effect.",15.8
"love the game so far! i havent noticed any problems yet.it just took some time @ the launch of the game. im running it with msi gtx970 and a i7-4790 with 16gb ram. really amazing graphics and game! i recommend it :) 10/10",22.1
"the best version. thanks to beta testers with consoles.",23.1
"i just flew a plane into a building. 9/11 would play again",72.2
"amazing port very fun. i played they story mode on ps3 a while back and that was fun. i have only been playing online on pc and i love all the updates. the first person is great and its really fun to play with friends or do a pick up mission and play with randoms (hoping they have mics). all and all very worth it",64.8
"very impressed by this pc port. had low expectations for aaa titles, but this didnt let me down",34.4
"cant even start the damn game. what the hell fix this soon!",1.6
"offline: amazing single player experience, great campaign, interesting characters. online: no point to play, lots of script kiddies and s, would not recommend.",47.6
"gta online ed up to save my character, now i have ing lipgloss and fake eyebrows. 11/10",91.2
"this game is good but that loading in gta online 9/10",37.4
"*kill people* *goes to strip club* *get some hookers* *hit the security b*tch* 11/10 must buy btw you can shock people with taser baaaamm",56.8
"the best game rockstar has ever released, if not - the best game among all games. the amount of detail gta v has is beyond words, from graphics to audio to environment words alone cannot explain, you have to experience it to believe it. 10/10 from me, ill also bow down and take my hat off to rockstar.",86.7
"very cool, and awesome game smooth if you have a good graphics card and very fun with friends story line was great and i had no trouble with this game whatsoever i recommend this game if you dont have it i recommend you buy it :)",50.8
"best thing that ever happened in this year :( except the part that im using amd graphich so no graphic driver support like nvidia graphic cards",92.9
"its still early on in this games life, but even at release the game plays and looks amazing even on my 760. you will need a fair amount of vram, so watch out and be prepared.",22.4
"first things first was to buy a smart car. i died in it at 60 fps 1080p and it was beautiful :)",51.9
"from what i experienced in the short time i was actually able to get this game to run(probably around a half hour total), i would rate this game 9/10. unfortunately this launch was a huge disappointment as 95% of the time the game refuses to even run, and the few times it did, crashes resulted randomly or even as a result of clicking on a different window and then clicking back on the game screen. i have opened a ticket with rockstar support and tried all of the fixes they and other people have recommended but nothing has worked. funny how they delayed the release again and again to ensure that the game is as polished as possible, and to make certain that both heists and the gta online experience are ready to roll out on day one for pc. well guess what rockstar? the game doesnt even run for a lot of us. im sure eventually this problem will be fixed on your end and then ill be able to forgive you but until then, i just want to warn anyone whos thinking about spending their hard earned money on this game that there is a significant chance the game wont even run, and so i would recommend waiting until rockstar has fixed this issue.",1.8
"the only game ive bought in 3 years that was worth the money, and i have almost 400 games. buy it. now. seriously.",70.5
"yes, it brings back mems from playing on a console! and just awesome game if first time legit has everything, and if you have mates to play with, you can have hours of fun!!",38.2
"im just at beginning of the game and this is some kind of a first impression comment, but still: its crazy good! worth the wait for pc too, engine is so smooth and realistic. if you like these kind of games, youll have to own it proudly.",24.5
"the game is great except for one thing. i really hate how im crashing multiple times in row for me and then being fine for maybe an hours. i feel like paying this much for the game and it being capatable for me i shouldnt have to deal with these kind of problems.",15.4
"good things: -good optimization, runs on my mid-range pc with high settings -great storyline -fun online mode -friendly people online bad things: -sometimes crashes -long loading screens my pc specifications: processor amd fx(tm)-6300 six-core processor memory (ram) 8.00 gb graphics nvidia geforce gtx 750 ti",28.5
"gtav is a fantastic game on pc, really well optimized, but, does have its issues(which ive listen below) which i hope rockstar will fix in the future. issues: texture/model pop-in (there is a workaround by setting the gtav.exe process in task manager to high priority) shadow draw distance issues (only renders high quality shadows at a very low distance.) some stuttering issues (workaround as well, at least for nvidia[dont know about amd] by setting the max pre-rendered frames to 1 in the nvidia control panel or nvidia inspector) timing out from gta online session when alt-tabbed or have the steam overlay up. other than the stated issues above, gtav its amazingly well done, highly recommend! specs: i5 2500k @ 3.7ghz evga gtx 680 2gb 32gb ddr3 ram",17.6
"this game is alot of fun, better optimized than many other games in a similar situation. i would not recomend it for anyone with higher than 1gb of vram due to the fact that you will likely have to play at 1440x900p. overall very fun and gta online is amazing.",22.2
"great job rockstar, you managed to completely disappoint me. the endless delays were meant to be to polish the game right? well done. the game is so much polished that i cannot even get past the ing launcher. i have tried so many fixes that people have released, from disabling the graphics to reinstalling the game. i was in midst of formatting the pc completely, then realised that no game should be this hard to play, and worth formatting my entire system. so good job, rockstar, i am not going to be thrilled about your next step, if there will be one. even if the patch will be released, and game becomes stable or whatsoever, that will not change my attitude towards your company. you just dont deliver, plain and simple. yeah the game might be good or not, that will depend on my experience, if i manage to get one.",38.1
"it was 60 dollars for a 60 gb game, the way i see it 1 dollar per gb is pretty good for the fun i am getting out of this",33.7
"ive already played gtav twice before, but not like this. gtav for pc is a good port, if you where wondering. theres a few rendering glitches as of this review but rockstar is good about fixing this game. basically its gta4 but not  and has non-modded first-person mode, which works extreamly well. pick this game up, now.",29.0
"this game is graphically outstanding, gameplay wise is just fine. grand theft auto 5 runs very smoothly with my beastly computer and all i can say is that first person with the best graphics on, is like playing a game of life",19.2
"as of writing have only played a few hours of online but i am already very impressed. playing with friends is a blast. i anticipate many good times to be had with this game, glad it finally came to pc with the improvements from xb1/ps4. controlling vehicles with keys took getting used to for me but keybinding and/or a gamepad can fix that. other than that, no gripes. exemplary port.",4.9
"we need more players in deathmatch or other categories. at the most 60+. it would be extremely fun!!! please update this request. especially considering the size of the world",16.9
"seriously, wtf is with the loading screens. i load a mission, 10 minute loading screen. i load a race, 10 minute loading screen. want to join frends map, 10 minute loading screen. i load anything, even if i cant fit because the room is now full, 10 minute loading screen. the game itself is fun, but seriously, i never want to do side missions because of the bs, 10 minute loading screens. not to mention, the damn game kicks me to offline mode if i idle, 10 minute loading screen. i cant stop the game from loading a mission if i hit it by mistake, 10 minute loading screen. i try to go from offline to online, 10 minute loading screen.",41.4
"story mode review pros +fantastic characters +huge gameworld filled with things to do and see +very customizable +tons of side missions +20 hours long of just main story +excellent gameplay cons -story is hit or miss especially the ending. -player choice is almost non-existent. the only times you ever get to choose are before heists. -heists blow . usually 30 minutes of prep time or more for uninspired, infinetly respawning enemy shooting gallaries. -missions are never emotionally satisfying. mixed side characters have little to no effect on the main story. controls on kb&m are ehh. game is really easy. 7/10 multiplayer review pros +custom characters +leveling system is very rewarding +apartments and vehicles give you a good reason to take part in a ton of different jobs. +there are a lot of ing jobs. like. so ing many. +free roam is fun as . cons -lag is pretty common. -insane loading time. 9/10 port report ill start by saying this port is not as good as many people have made it out to be. my specs are well above the recommended and my fps goes from 30-60 on a mix of normal and high settings. there are a ton of options to fiddle with and you can customize all of your controls.",41.2
"played the heck out of the ps3 version, and i do not regret for a single second buying the pc version!!",20.8
"best game ever. love the graphics of the loading screen. 10/10 would buy again",25.7
"ummm...just played and yank it. game is 9/10 and story is 10/10.",17.0
"dont buy this game they cant get their  right makes us wait two extra months and they cant even make the lauch work.. i cant even get the game to even come up on my gaming pc and im sick of this good job rockstar you screwed us yet again",47.5
"17 h the day after its out pretty cool. even loading screen are fast as hell. #pcmasterrace. as for the pure perfomance of the game ive got a 60 fps constant with a gtx 760 gb from nvidia not the best card thought. also the heist are amazing when you are with poeple you know and like because they will help you out not drag your out to restart an heist on the bank for expample ive wiped 60 time on an heist before we quit it because two of the poeple of the heist were not as performant as a japanese friend that was level 100+ i was only level 15 at the time. as for the solo its amazing but everybody knew it already. and try to get into heist very quickly and add perfomant poeple to your friend on the social rocktars stuff! my best luck to you in this amazing game. best regards,",81.8
"not had one issue with this game and the max settings are not too demanding! you know what gta is you dont need to be told! yes its worth getting on pc!",40.6
"havent enjoyed a game this much in a while... you can easily loose track of time when playing this game 10/10",30.5
"this game is great, but without mods it is kind of the same boring game, if you have previously played it on the consoles but with amazing graphics, compared to the consoles. the best thing about gta on pc is the mods that will be sure to come out, but as there are none yet the game is still kind of dry. this game is not very well optimised for pc players, as the keyboard and mouse controls are kind of unusual, this isnt saying they are unusable, but if a player has never played pc or gta on pc before then it takes some getting used to, which is why i recommend playing this game with a controller, unless you are exclusively playing in first person mode.",34.2
"aaa masterpiece if you wint to know -buy this game -download it -have fun",50.1
"i would have liked to have seen a lower price point for a two year old game. but even two years on gta v holds up as the best open world game on the marekt... and it runs wonderfully even on my mid-rage rig.",34.2
"loading screen simulator 2015 seriously when youre playing online the whole experience is just loading screen after loading screen. mission failed? time to load the score board, now were loading something else. this wouldnt be too bad if the loading screens didnt last 2-3 minutes per screen.",48.8
"if you are planning to play this offline single player because of inconsistant web acces, or, for whatever reason do not buy this game.. an internet connection is required to start single player offline.",26.7
"im only gonna giving this 11/10 because of all the fun ive had.",60.5
"this, game is amazing, even if you played the console version(s) i recomend you pickup the pc version. i have had no bugs and its great. 10/10 - must buy",51.6
"video editor allows me to make cat stomp compilations so this game is a 10/10",6.4
"moves like jagger came up on the radio and i became insane after killing everyone on the server to the rhytm of moves like jagger 10moves/10jagggers would listen to the radio again",26.3
"its a good game if you can actoly get in to it i spent 30minets tring to get the game to work and lornch",1.4
"it took me so long to right this almost 17 months and i can now say it is well worth the wait!",15.4
"smoked weed and started viewing clowns trying to kill me. sundenlly got a minigun and shot them. 10/10, would smoke again.",35.4
"the wait was long, i even gave up hope at one point.... was it worth the wait? yup graphics wow , so good what if i bought it twice already... sell those crap versions and get this... so much worth doesnt even seem like i beat this game already almost 2 years ago on the ps3 get it",78.9
"gtx 980 i7-4790k 16gb ram 1600 asrock z97m pro4 runs great at 60-70fps so far. gta v is optimised great, a lot better than most new games that are released today.",32.5
"finally on pc (waited for years) welp, before it was announce to be sell on steam i cant wait so i buy ps4 what do i expect for pc? 1.kids screaming 2.racist people 3.lobby wars 4.trolling everywhere 5.hacker 6.scammer 7.noobs this is what i met on ps4 do you think it will happen on pc? who knows? [but i like the bonus tho :d]",8.0
"omg this game rules all! very happy that rockstar did good this time.",18.1
"ubisoft has to learn from rockstar how to optimized games.",29.0
"another amazing grand theft auto game. ive been sticking with grand theft auto for 13 years or so now. still remember the day i ran to the store to get gta iii for my ps2 in early 2003. ive played all of them and now, including this one. even tho for some its just a game, for me. its become a tiny part of my past. not to sound like a obessed gamer of some kind lol. its just, if you follow a games developement for so long it becomes something special. good old grand theft auto :) 100/10",39.7
"havent managed to launch it without crashing, but im sure its fun!",8.1
"this game is fantastic, but i think everyone already knows that: pros: -great open multiplayer world. -awesome story line (even though i havent gotten far) -game runs very smoothly -good customization -you dont have to go bowling with roman cons: it has a few bugs, like your screen sometimes freezes right after a mission. several of my friends has that bug, but no bif deal. 10/10, its that amazing and totally worth waiting for. thanks for beta-testing it for us, console peasants.",67.9
"its worse than gta iv. horrible game. if you dont play it exactly the way they want you to then you get a mission failed and have to start over. they dont even frelling tell you what you can and cannot do!! this has got to get a worst game of the year award for being so horrible.",0.5
"if i had to choose beetwin this game and my mother id choose this game edit: im orphan now.",36.4
"this is the best ersion of gta v. if your rig can handle it, youre in for a treat. it runs very smoothly.",14.5
"its been fun since 2013 but maybe i was overhyped with the graphics for pc but it still feels the same. i think i want my 60$ back. oh wait.",39.5
"good game. but i really hate these very long loading... and these sessions. and sometimes a huge lags... singleplayer is perfect.",39.5
"10/10 i love this game! fun to play with my friends :d ps need donation on cs:go skins now that i have none.",56.4
"already had this on the xbox one and 360 but i wasnt all that impressed with it. muddy textures and low framerates everywhere. but on the pc it looks beutiful and it is surprisingly well optimized. i manage anywhere from 43-60 fps never dropping below 40 even during the most intense battles on a slightly outdated 2gig amd 7870 gpu and an fx-8350 cpu. game is really fun to play and heists are enjoyable",83.4
"i stole a guys pimped as.s car and ran him over for like 10 times and finally died. 10/10",37.8
"great game, theres so much to do and its all worth the wait. (trust me)",30.6
"fu cking holy sh it gta v holy fu ck its fu cking gta v man its fu cking gta mother v. should you buy it? well maybe you should ask yourself are you a sexy  beast? if you are then by all means. but if youre an ugly feget sh!tlord then you can just fu ck straight off. the steam censoring really made this review annoying.",38.9
"it doesnt take much to know theyve just done it right. well done, rockstar. a true masterpiece that will raise my entertainment yet lower my success rate irl! 42/10 - would definitley destroy all my life oppertunities again.",50.5
"played it first on ps3, then ps4 and now on pc, i just cant get enough of it. 10/10.",8.5
"social club is the biggest crap i have ever seen. im sorry rockstar but if your going to put a game on steam, dont force us to use something that no one wants. however if you must oppress us in this way, please use something that works.... it let me play once and gta v is a beautiful game yet the next time i had to sign in again, it refused. claiming that either my steam was linked to a different account or locking me out due to too many unsuccessful (heavy sarcasm) log in attempts. i have tried numerous times to log in, change passwords, switch accounts, anything to just play your game, unfortunatly to no avail. i have realized that at this rate it will never work, so thank you for nothing. gta v is a great game but social club ruins it entirely.",36.2
"game looks and runs great at 1920x1080 with 144hz refresh rate would highly recomend this to any grand theft auto fan",72.4
"this is a performance review! i barely meet the minimum specs and it runs great! never had it crash and it stays around 40 fps, though the textures on everything but faces and cars look awful. in online it still runs good even when a bunch of idiots with grenade launchers blow everything up. pretty much what i mean is i havent had a single problem, but remember to update your graphics drivers! it makes a big difference!",33.1
"love it!! fun to play with other people. one negative is controll mechanic can be difficult especially when flying but you can change this is the control menu",34.7
"what can i say, this is the ultimate open world criminal rp game. go anywhere, do anything. the addition of first person view for pc, enhanced graphics and mouse control, have for me just made what great....epic 10/10",33.4
"it took 1 year and 6 months and was delayed 3 times but it was well worth the wait. 1080p @ 60fps with all the settings maxed out looks amazing. 20/10 jumped off a helicopter without a parachute and lived. would do again.",25.5
"game is really amazing. download was bad, tho, but gameplay is amazing. i like story and graphics. music is good, first-person mode, i like it all. but most amazing thing is that i dont need to listen to roman on going bowling. :p",63.2
"this game is complete ! after 4 months of rockstar pushing back the release date, they finally released it and it has so many problems with it. for first off, i cant even play the game because it wont even load when i hit play! get your game together",34.8
"they took all the critic they got from gta 4 and made a perfect game that runs smooth even on older pc.",59.1
"holy  this game runs smooth and the graphics are amazing!",53.8
"the game is working perfect now ever science the patch. great game hold on i got to go do some hiest......",38.5
"i didnt chose the thug life, the thug life chose me. 10/10",46.0
"got half a million in single player from pre order. went stright to the strip club and spent $200 on one continuous dance. then went to online for heists and seeing my zentorno, my jester, my half a million flat, los santos, blaine county, ocean, night sky and the explosions in hd 60 fps gg, 11/10 would go to strip club again! pcmr",18.8
"rockstar did a really good job on this. the delays seem to have paid off. the game runs completely maxed out (ultra settings @ 1920x1080) on my laptop (gtx 780m 4gb sli) and i get 40-60 fps. oh and the game is really fun too, a huge improvement from gta iv. i dont think i need to talk much about the game because everyone on earth knows its great already + huge improvement over grand theft auto iv + runs smooothly on mid range pcs + first person mode is amazing + entertaining characters and story + no glitches at all yet = co-op in the story mode would have been cool - first person mode doesnt work good for most missions",25.9
"this game is simply amazing. you cannot even compare it to the console version. this game is running flawless on launch. this never happens anymore. every game on launch is full of bugs and errors. this game doesnt have that. graphics are unreal. i recommend everyone to go out and buy this game. rockstar goes above and beyond compared to other companies. 10/10.",60.6
"i donwload it i was playing about 2 hours then i had a job and after 3 hours i wanted to play again and i had problem failed to start game (missing executable) any 1 help?",21.1
"must be nice for those who it runs great for. im stuck in windowed mode and after a hour nothing gives. change resolution, refresh rates, other suggestions online, and nothing. i have a $60 game i cant enjoy because its stuck in a  windowed mode... wish i could get a refund and move on. edit: using nvidia optimization fixed the windowed issue. however there are still sli issues. my fps will not cap or stay steady and my gpus stay around 60% usage. i can turn the graphics all to ultra or all to medium/high, nothing changes.",10.0
"if youve played grand theft auto v on consoles, then you wont be disappointed. if you havent, youre in luck because this is indeed the definitive version. in my opinion, rockstar have done a wonderful job developing the game for pc. it was well worth the wait. the amount of graphical options means you can tweak the game to how you like it, especially if youre limited by hardware. the addition of the rockstar editor is just he icing on the cake. you may not be pleased with the price point due to when the game was released, but think of it as a brand new game being released in 2015 (because its that good).",31.3
"i get 60fps but i need the graphics at very low settings. besides that, no issues, got the driver. yeah get the game.",90.2
"very well optimized, runs very well on my gtx 660 sc, and the director mode is freaking awesome.",66.1
"buy the holy heck out of this. totally worth the wait. 11/10",18.8
"first great gta in 10 years, greatly upgraded graphics in comparisson with next gen consoles, good story, smooth gameplay, en great fps if you have the hardware for it (takes a lot of vram, around 7.5 gb in sli config (so 4 with single card)), gtx 670 oc 2 way sli has mostly around 50-60 fps (all maxed out at 1080p but no msaa), though sometimes has verry bad fps drop due to fetching data from ram (so not because the scene itself is to heavy)",52.4
"elder scrolls online had a better launch. all my friends are fanboying over it though",52.9
"60 fps at any settings... having so much fun, and i generally dont like real-life kind of games, or cars or shooters, but this is spectacular! i just wish they made fantasy themed games this high quality too. there was so much work and effort put into this game and its very evident once you play it. one of very few titles worth the full price and probably more. 10/10",38.9
"this is the best game in gta series. i think gta online is very great and singleplayer is just absolutely interesting. in long term, i think the game would be boring but very very long time :v. 10/10 sorry for bad grammarino",22.9
"awesome, awesome game. paid full price and got a full experience. 10/10, undoubtedly.",42.5
"good game great gameplay overpriced for coming out a year later on pc. bought it anyway.",7.7
"youve all read way more than your fair share of reviews on gta 5, as if its even needed. but my comment goes to the 3.700 haters. i really dont see how anyone can have a negative review about this game. its the most perfect game, the best of the series, and the most perfect edition of it. its a sad sight to see how people can be unfair for no particular reason. reflects more about themselves than anything else.",38.5
"you know how it says ive played 2 hours of this game well i havnt. just trying over and over again to launch the game, i bet the game is really good and i hope a update comes out soon that will let me play and if one does i will play for a real 2 hours then give it a true review. but until that time comes it will always be my 60$ copy of game launching simulator 2015. 10/10 would excessively launch again",2.1
"i can eat ps and qs in glorious 1080p 60fps now 10/10",25.2
"take forever and a day to re-release this on pc, and still have it be the most unstable pos to date...",38.9

"third time ive bought it. xbox 360- xbox one- pc. you dont shell out $180 for a game unless its as good as gta 5. also its the most fun benchmarking software on the market. already melted a friends gpu on day one. edit- gta v can be played on 8g of memory. if youre ram crashing on memory like i was its probably virtual memory. youtube how to add virtual memory, super easy. but this still uses about 6 gigs of physical for me. so maybe 4 gigs if you had nothing else open. -my original stupidity post- (((this game cant be played with 8 gigs of ram. if it can, im doing something incredibly wrong. 1920x1080 and 720p with everything as low as it will go and ram crashes on the second mission.))))",38.9

"to describe gta 5 (online) in short would be; the combination of games including payday, need for speed, the crew with the original gta elements that was in the previous installments. there is a wide variety of things to do from racing to missions to death matches. golf, tennis ... darts. content updates being free makes it more desirable, although faced with some issues right now, (server overload, disconnects). gta 5 online is worth a shot if you got friends, if your a loner then play single player. get a crew going, run some heists, buy a car, mod it, race and impress dem hunnies or get the booty at the strip club and/or random chicks walking on the streets.",37.6

"finally..... so im running an overclocked i5-3570k (ivy bridge) and a gtx 970 and the game runs great maxed out. i turn off vsync and refection quality lower since that seems to give me stuttering issues (probably related to ram), but everything else is pretty much as high as it can get. i float around 60-70 fps even with population density all the way up, though it does drop considerably when in a vehicle in first person. not sure what thats about, but they may have a fix for it down the line. the game itself is expectantly great, nothing different from the console versions. havent dabbled in online or heists yet, but im sure theyre just as good as they were on consoles, although im expecting a serious frames drop, but thats bound to happen in a multiplayer setting. all-in-all, if you lost your social life playing the console versions and you want the benefit of higher graphical capabilities and future modding, then dont hesitate to buy the game. its good 98% good to go. anxious to see what the modding community will do with this thing down the road.",25.3
"this game is so good that it wont even turn on 9/11 -ign",56.4

"i have been playing the xbox 360 version for over year and have been patient enough to wait for this game to come to pc (completely bypassing the next gen consoles). always love pc gaming and it is hard not to see why. the pc version of gta v is a master piece of open world free to do as you please with some stunning graphics. currently playing with the recommended graphics card gtx 660ti amp edition and i can run most the display setting high. cant wait to test it out with titan x when it arrives. this game has surpassed its predecessors and hope rockstar continues to keep up the good work regarding hackers in the online community, that completely ruined gta iv. i am disappointed when i still have to return to the xbox 360 and play with friends who have yet to experience the true taste of real gaming at its best. well done, nice port.",14.7

"once you get past the r* social club , its a pretty enjoyable game.",59.6
"at the point of this writing, i have put over 32 hours into this game so far, i have only completed about 30-32% of the single player and i havent touched the multi player as of yet. the game is so much fun its insane. the music and talk programs grab my attention so much that all i do is ride around on motorcycles and listen to them. they are a few minor issues like random frame drops, but they are more annoying than game breaking. this is a great port; i highly recommend buying this game. 8/10. p.s: give my bro trevor some love too, just like franklin",37.4

"this game is just everything we want... boobs... s... and the stopping of global warming... <3",57.9
"easily the best entry in the series to date. memorable and interesting characters along with neat new mechanics such as the special abilities and character swapping. as pc ports go, its mostly a top notch job, with a few quirks such as goofy mouse+keyboard controls for a few things. in almost all cases a controller will remain the prefered method of play, at least in single player. gta online tends to require the more precise aim of the mouse. few notes of warning though, the load times can be pretty intense if not running this on an ssd, and there appears to be some sort of memory leak as frame rates will stay 60+ for a few hours, then plummet dramatically.",39.9
"utter ! if you have a laptop that runs intel api with amd gpu, do not buy! gta v will not run on intel cpu and amd gpu on laptops at the moment, rockstar refuses to answer the thousands of people waiting for a fix, and it does not look like the fix is coming any time soon.",0.6

"san andreas is back in this fantastic installment to the grand theft auto series. i was actually surprised how realistic and beautiful the game turned out to be. first-person mode makes gta v feel like a completely different game. npc artificial intelligence and interaction had improved dramatically. the plenty of graphical options will make any pc enthusist cream in their pants as tessellation, advanced shadows, txaa, 4k textures and a lot more are available with supreme hardware optimization. animals, bikes, aircraft, side-missions, immersive atmosphere and ambient enviornments make story mode surreal, as gta online provides the most in-depth experience ever seen within the series. aside from some buggy custom keyboard bindings which may or may not be fixed, rockstar has definitely redeemed themselves within the pc community. overall rating: 10 of 10",37.9

"gta 5 as an exercise in world building and story is amazing, the world feels alive, deep and most importantly fun. the 3 main characters are varied enough to keep things from becoming stale, and being able to specialize them, through semi rpg elements and purchases is a nice touch. as far as gameplay related bugs go i encountered just one in 12 hours (unable to progress through mission). however the game makes us of often auto saves and allows quick saving so this was not a massive issue due to being able to load previous save. in terms of a the quality of the pc port i have several woes, firstly installing on a samsung ssd caused memory issues and made the game unplayable, secondly crossfire scaling is not as good as i hoped. despite this a great set of graphical options offered allowing intricate customization. overall very happy with the game",24.6

"*pro tip, ignore the negative reviews that have 20+ hours of gameplay but their review states they are locked out of the game... by far the best game in the series. first person view mode is a great addition to an already fantastic game, crisp graphics and a video editor are just icing on the cake. story is good and improved from previous versions by having 3 main characters, all of which are introduced to eachother through some pretty funny circumstances. the multiplayer is top notch and considering it was a free update (from 360/ps3) its amazing rockstar has delivered as much as they did. heists improve the mp even further by giving you a team and multiple objectives to work towards a high payout. none of the previous gtaiv issues on pc are present and it really seems rockstar learned some valuable lessons from their previous release. i cant recommend this game enough.",22.6

",eifbgnaevn soooo good. played it originally on the xbox 360(barf). i expected the same, but with pc graphics but it ended up feeling differnt somehow. it is really well optmized, though mobile nvidia cads have issues but there is a simple workaound until they fix it so, *shrug*. i end up really liking the pc controls more than gamepad control, though i still enjoy gamepad for flying. it is a seemless transition between keyboard and gamepad, no pop up thing, no pause, nothing. anyways, i had a lot of fun with it and it is definitely worth picking up. oh, and i have more time in the game then steam says, so idunno why it only registered this amoun of time.",3.9

"haha....well. overhyped 2k. graphics are good i guess, however they feel way too similar to gta iv. the gameplay is very stiff. it doesnt feel dynamic, like the physics are bad actors. unconvincing at best. the start of the game, at least, is riddled with crappy cutscenes. i got so bored of them that i didnt bother with missions after the prologue, i just went rogue in the huge sandbox world. i wouldnt recommend it at all at this price, and i will never ever have hopes of a game as good as san andreas from rockstar ever again. thumbs up on the first person, though. oh, and the best part? the best graphics and physics are found in the citys cats. yes, the cats are highly realistic unlike most other parts of this game.",43.2
"awsome game...totally recomand it. never a dull moment and having 3 main guys is totally cool and keeps it fresh. only did the progress on the main missions but man thats only the tip of the iceberg...it has lots of side activities aka mini games which you can pretty much call other games included. 10/10 would preorder again :)",30.3

"im sure everyone knows what gta is, so i will skip right to it. the pc version is extreme well optimized. i have been running it with barely over minimum system requirements, and although the graphics are pretty limited with my crap computer, the game still runs smooth. i may update this after i install my new gpu. i love the self radio station, where it allows you to import your own music playlists into the game and listen to them either as a regular playlist, or as an actual radio station with dj commentary in between songs. the rockstar editor tool is also amazing, allowing you to film your gameplay and edit yourr clips into a movie for uploading on youtube, and you can upload your clips directly from the in-game menu. you can seemlessly switch between using your game pad, and your keyboard/mouse, without needing to change any settings. this helps with navigating menus and editing your rockstar editor clips. i cant say much about the graphics, for reasons i have already stated, but im told its amazing with a proper gpu. bottom line, this game is well worth your money, even if you already own it on a console.",39.6

"it seems a bunch of people have issues with getting this game to run. regardless of this my review will not be negative and i will try to help people out in this way: if you are a bullguard user, you might have the problem that your launcher will not start at all! this is what i did to fix this: open up bullguard and go to the general settings under settings. there will be an option there called selfprotection (allow bullguard to protect itself from termination, (or something similar) turn this off and reboot your computer, chances are great your launcher will now start normally! :d now for my actual review: have not played the game much, but i love the gta franchise and even though this game has had its fair share of problems on the pc i am still not gonna be negative about the games. the game looks great and what i have seen from other people playing and what i have played myself the game is loads of fun!! go get it!",23.5

"played alot of this on ps4... even better on pc. great optimization. that was pretty much the only worry on pc. millions of reviews have been out... the port is solid. able to remain above 40 fps always at 1440p maxed out with just a single 290. much better than anticipated. even shows you how much vram is going to be used as you adjust settings. great looking game.",12.4

"becomes a roadkill by insane civilians with panic issues... 10/10 would flip & fly in 1st person again. on serious note i would recommend this game to any gta fan, even on my  as pc i can play it on around 30 fps (isnt much but i can play it!), there are some issues with session disconnect etc but i assume its only during the first few days of launch of servers being overloaded and will be fixed soon as we go on, otherwise i havent encountered any issues yet & would defo recommend it as its nicely optimized for pc.",94.4

"this... this is the grand theft auto we have been waiting for my fellow gamers. ever since i bought this on ps3 i have wondered what it would be like in first-person, and this is ecactly what i expected. even though i cant run it at its very best, even with normal settings this game looks and feels amazing. i can only hope that one day i will be able to experience this masterpiece on ultra settings, maybe even 4k. but for now, i will continue to enjoy this work of art any way possible. i highly recommend this game, especially if you have never played gta v prior to this pc version. if youre returning as i am from a previous system, welcome home.",38.7
"amazing improvement to the already great gta 5 for consoles. definitley worth picking up, although i am currently having some stuttering issues which i hope are fixed in a patch. other than that bug and a few other performance issues i recommend everyone reading this to buy the game.",42.3
"finally game works. some patches were made and now my game runs perfectly. i own a gaming laptop: msi dominator gt70, 8gb ram, intel i7 4810qm 2.8ghz, nvidia geforce 870m 3 gb vram great game. good response from rockstar. for other rigs configurations, i dunno.",22.5
"awesome game. the wait was totally worth. ive played 45hrs by now (15hrs of them online) and just finished the main storyline. while i also made some sidemissions im at approx 65% progress of the singpleplayer after already playing 30hrs of sp mode. that alone was worth the price.",75.1

"extremely entertaining, excellent graphics complemented by a seamless user experience. overall a fantastic game that can be played on both laptops and desktops. with all settings on high and getting 60+ fps, its a major update from the ps4 version. my verdict is simple : it was worth the wait, the long wait. p.s. well done rockstar on this spectacular user experience and graphics you have managed to pull off!",25.0

"i bought this game when it was released back in 2013 for ps3 and xbox360. i played alot of online and a little bit of singleplayer. i enjoy online the most i think its what makes this game great being able to access the entire map and do whatever you please. now that i own a decent gaming laptop, the graphics are gorgeous and vivid. i am playing at 900p and getting about 35-40 fps. back on ps3 the graphics are unbearable and i dont know how my eyes got used to the frames. i havent noticed any pop in whatsoever (coming from a regular 5400rpm 1tb hdd user). there is a bit of jaggies and stuttering but i have it under control when i set up maximum pre rendered frames to 1 in my nvidia control papnel and power management to maximum performance. i would reccomend this game to anyone it is truely amazing how rockstar developed this game allowing those with not very good specs to play this game even at normal settings the game still looks beautiful. thank you rockstar thank you pc please guys get this game youll be amazed!",14.2

"this game is ing awesome, but its glitchy and the players are s/trolls. its also already got hackers in it, mostly just people getting infinite money and rp which i really dont give a  about, however i found out some are doing much more when my tank was instantly blownup from an smg shot (im scared what the future holds if this is already here). the glitched are pretty bad too, i have had issues with everything from crahing and getting achievements i didnt do (i have the lvl 100 achiev and im lvl 71..) all the way to being white screened for eternity during heists and being forced to restart. even with all this ery, im still having fun, the game is still a ing blast and ill continue to play it i reccomend this game but please understand the games current state before you purchase.",40.2
"the game is great. nothing else can really be said about that. but rockstar done messed up. after 3 delays, the game cant be told apart from the current gen consoles (excluding framerate), which is a massive dissapointment. if you bought the game on ps3/xbox 360 and like gta alot and want a better experience, buy this when it gets a discount. if you bought it on ps3 and upgraded to ps4, there simply isnt enough content for the large price tag and i would stay clear until you can get a massive discount. however if you havent ever experienced gta 5 yet, this should absolutely be a must buy, dont hesitate and just get it. now.",61.9
"this is a good game, but i find it difficult to play it for many hours due to me already playing on xbox 360 when it was originally released for the console. its very similar to the xbox one, and ps4 release apart from obviously 60 fps (frames per second) and better graphics. i can tell a difference in the graphics and the game looks incredible and isnt very demanding which is good. the game suffers from a large about of bugs due to the new, and recent release but nothing that cant be fixed. it honestly sucks that we had to wait just under 2 years for the pc port and its still full of irritating and game breaking bugs which effect the overall game experience. but putting that aside - by the far the best gta in the series imo and a good port apart from the bugs. i recommend this game to any gta fan, and anybody who wants to experience an unrealistic machine gun town 3rd person/1st person shooter.",8.0
"this might be the best game this year. its much better than the console versions, and a much better port than gta iv was. great job r* this time around. took you a year and a half but it was worth the wait.",25.2

"i cant play my gta v because i linked the wrong social club account to my steam account seems like a prob that could easily be fixed but nooooooooo rockstar made the link permanent i just blew 60$ because im stupid but i know i cant be the only one who has done this",1.9

"amazing, everything i have hoped for runs wonderfully.",33.9
"the definitive version of an already critically-acclaimed game. this game deserves every bit of praise it got in the past and now all that praise can also be applied to a wonderful pc version that plays well on a wide variety of different systems. a must have game if you like rockstars open world formula and above average storytelling/character development.",25.1
"gtav plays excellently on the pc. the optimization is great, with mid-range computers being able to flawlessly play this game with little hassle. its a game that can be as beautiful as you want it to be, with a plethora of options to tweak. the controls work well with keyboard and controller. the awesome thing is that you can have the keyboard/mouse plugged in as well as a controller, and the game will detect which you are using and adjust the tooltips. the polish on this game is very apparent. the character migration also works well. what im trying to get at is everything about this game is everything from the xbox one/ps4, but better in every way. except helicopter control, which i feel is a little loose and more difficult, but still usable.",7.8
"load times are insane, lobbies are never full and when they are you arent able to actually get in the game. in the time ive played the game crashed my brand new gtx970s drivers twice. i should not have pre-ordered this.",37.8

"crashes at launcher itself. money burnt. feeling pissed. update: read some posts in the discussions page. found out that the launcher crash is related to nvidia optimus technology. have to disable my nvidia gpu before starting the launcher and thereafter enable it again. the game works now and is pretty well optimized (so no complaints there). but the fact that you have to do this stuff everytime you want to play blows. update 2: well, a 427 mb update fixed the launcher problem and now i have no problems recommending this game.",51.8
"short and sweet review. answers to questions you may have: -yes, you can transfer a character from another console onto gta v pc. you will even have the option to change the characters appearance with a slightly more in-depth creator -the graphics are stellar and there are a ton of options you can tinker with -gamepads are fully supported -loading times are drastically shorter compared to consoles -gta online achievements and progression carries over with your character as well, but not campaign progression unbelievably, contrary to most games that are newly released, there were no issues with online multiplayer that i found. played with my friend, it was smooth as silk. the game runs like a dream, and i havent hit any major glitches or bugs that broke the game. this is an excellent port of an excellent game. well worth the wait",74.8
"just as stephen colbert won television, rockstar has won video games. this was called the everything simulator, and thats not inaccurate. attention to detail, solid mechanics, a great storyline, online gameplay even i enjoy, variety of cars/weapons/clothes/buildings/people/everything else: one of the best games ever made.",21.4

"fantastic. i owned the game on xbox one and 360 and i thought it would be a waste of money to get on pc. regardless, i pre-ordered it and took a risk. i would never turn back. i dont have the best pc, gtx 750ti, amd fx 6300 and 8gb ram and etc. it runs beautifully, i have it all set to high running a smooth 60 fps with textures set to normal. i set everything to very high and leave textures on normal and i get between 45 to 59 fps, never drops below. fantastic game. looks so amazing on pc and i would recommend to anyone. it was well worth the wait and the added pre-order money doesnt go unnoticed. only thing i dont like is how we use our social club names not steam, and i have my social club name as an old gamertag and i have to wait a year in between changes and it doesnt say how long i have left to wait. doesnt affect the game in any way whatsoever. fantastic.",15.1
"for anyone with an nvidia graphics card having problems launching the game: go to device manager and disable the nvidia adapter, and then start the game. you should be able to go through social club without any problems now. now enable the graphics card before the game starts up (gotta be quick!) this should fix the problem.",24.8
"r* has out done themselves with this one, first person is done amazingly well, that to me third person feels weird but, it still has its usefulness while limited, the game can be played perfectly fine in first person without having to swap to third person. im running an r9 280(aka 7950 rebranded) heavy oc, an i5-4690k minor oc, and 8gb 1600mhz ram, 1080p is silk smooth on max settings, but 5760x1080 cant really get over 30fps but thats okay, since im only running one gpu, and im mostly using it for screenshotting the amazingness of gta v :) like most the player base, ive had an amazing experiance thus far and highly recommend this game to anyone.",41.0
"at first i had rated this game poor due to constant crashes and lock ups with it. i had thought it was the game itself, but after some trouble shooting i found the root cause was an outdated bios on my motherboard. seems gta v is the first game to push the cpu hard enough to expose the issue with the older bios. after the bios update the game has yet to crash or lockup. if you have an asus maximus vi motherboard with a bios older than rev 1603 installed and have lockups / crashes. install rev 1603, it will fix the lockup and crash issues. this is by far the best gta game yet and the pc version was worth waiting for. the graphics are insane. being able to jump between mouse and keyboard and 360 controller is awesome. drive a car on the controller, get to a roof top, then jump to mouse and keyboard and use a sniper rifle. my pc can run this on max settings and rarely see fps drop under 52 fps: i7-4790k 16 gb geforce 980gtx 500 gb samsung 850 windows 10 pro",16.4
"lov this game. worht the year wait lol installed right away played right away. so far its an amazing game with no bugs. how often does a pc game come out thats actually optimized for pc these days. never. but his one is. only con is its 60gb lol but not really a con just took forever to download.",37.6

"i actually never wrote a review before, but after playing gta v i decided to do it :o the game is totally out of concept. the storyline is about family problems, spending time with your children, and chasing after your cheating wife... there are also unnecessary activities like yoga and tennis.. they did even put it in some of the missions, and that made it very boring. the game doesnt give me the feeling that im playing gta, but the sims -_- however, the graphics are amazing and the requirements are low. the gameplay is also nice, so i can still recommend it.",51.2

"its the ultimate version. runs well on a decent but not bleeding edge pc, as well as my friends low end pc. beyond that, its gta v and its playable, i dont think i need to go much more length than that. all that said, it does have some issues that i assume will be patched. for instance, the ai during missions are generated by the host in online, which is usually fine except when that person has a piece of garbage pc. in that instance the game will drop your framerate to the hosts framerate when you get up close, which is horrifying. beyond that its everything we wanted and probably one of the best looking games ive ever seen. it is well worth the cost, and i wholly recommend it.",45.2

"just another open world rpg. only 3 classes that are almost the same and also have predefined races that cant be changed. skills level up by doing stuff like running. there is a main story line and a couple of side quests. but no boss fights, only trash mobs the whole game. you can buy a lot of items, but they dont have stats. weapons are mostly ranged and you will get in trouble using melee only. theres only one kind of armor that isnt even visible on the character. good thing so far, there are a lot of different mounts to ride. some of them can also fly but are destroyed quickly if you collide with the level geometry. setting could be interesting if youre bored with fantasy.",15.0

"absolutely stellar pc version. finally a game that makes full use of my computers specs to deliver outstanding fidelity at silk smooth framerates. currently running this fully maxed at 1080p and getting 80-90 fps on a 780 ti. mouse and keyboard integration is flawless allowing for full enjoyment of the games ridiculously fun gunplay. one look at the options menu and you can really see how much love went into the pc version. overall perfect release, no complaints. its pretty depressing though that this is not the norm and we have to contend with shetties like ubisoft constantly making our hardware feel useless with their garbage optimized ports.",34.5

"the game you basically allready know from all the videos from youtube while waiting to get the pc version. compareed to the console version (ps3), is a very big improvememt, one more radio station, new songs to the other radio stations, the graphics look awesome, the first person prespective is a bit wierd at first, almost the entire keyborad does something diferent but in general is better than the original release. and it proves that pc is better to play games than consoles (but not all games aply).",32.2

"gta online has terrible consistancy errors and terribly  networking problems that cause both pvp and coop to be extremely unrealible, glitchy, and downright unfun to play due to the inconsistancy between damage to you, damage to enemies, vehicles materializing infront of you, or taking instantly teleporting 90 degree turns. the single player is ok, nothing spectacular, but the multiplayer, the one thing that rockstar should have learned how to do by now considering max payne 3s online was a complete ing joke, and gta 4s online was fairly ok and fun.",65.8
"all i can suggest is do not buy this game now wait 6 months the game us currently unplayable for a lot of people there is an issue that comes up for most people where after playing a few minutes the game will have a dramatic frame rate drop and then eventually become unplyable all together no matter what settings rockstar knows this is happening but they are simply refusing to patch it yet they are focusing on the stupid windows installer thing when this issue is bigger in my opinon",45.7
"ok so this is another hard one to recommend but im going to for the single player only! (yeah... right.) single players great for the hour i get before i crash due to rockstar signing me out for inactivity... multiplayer is brilliant if you have friends... public is ing terrible and should be avoided like the plague... another thing i hate is the bad rep system.. if you quit jobs early or act like an  they force you to play with other 12 year old  stains and you know the worst part about that? (it sounds awesome right? no) theworst part is the game crashes so ing much it punishes you by giving you bad rep... so pray you dont crash to desktop as 90% of players are doing online else youll have to play with the s and shall be branded an .. rockstar i dont appreciate being punished (and having my name i use in other games tarnished) from your own mistakes... fixthis  asap! buy this for simgle player only! i cannot recommend it right now but will be absolutely willing to reassess after a few more months.. and if you do buy it dont use your name from other games you  ;)",25.3

"moving on from the console versions of gta v, even after months of delaying and waiting, this game proves to still amaze all gamers. obviously, the graphics is the biggest upgrade, but the delation for the release of the game turned out well for its great optimization to the pc port. its amazing how relatable gameplay is with consoles just by using a controller. feels like theres no difference except (better) performance, graphics, and details in the game (like its music). i already owned a 360, ps4, and xbox one version of gta v, but it was well worth $60 to buy the pc version. you get what you paid for, and even more. this pc port is what every game developer should aim for. how optimized it is at launch compared to other games that releases a dead-bugged game that makes it almost impossible to play. its safe to say that all gta players will be missing out on a new experience if they dont purchase this game. 10/10",33.4

"- newbie to the gta series - the only gta game i ever played was the very first one that came out in 1997 on pc. i decided to buy this one due to all the hype and the much talked about graphics improvements. i have never been this satisfied paying $59.99 for a game ive barely knew anything about - much less played. the level of detail put in this game is amazing. everything from the graphics to the story line, truly impressive. this is the type of game that you dont have to worry about completing in a day. i am looking forward to playing this game for many months. there are small issues here and there that i noticed as far as bugs in the game but i anticipate they will be fixed in the near future. if you are on the fence about this game, i definitely recommend it. as a newbie to the series, i am glad i pulled the trigger on this one. funny acting, great story line, impressive graphics, tons of missions, awesome online multiplayer and it will push your high end card(s) to the limit. 9/10",57.2
"it didnt work and i had to disable my graphics card and reenable for it to launch, but i could care less because this is one of the best games ive ever played. best in class at everything. smooth as butter, runs better than gta iv on my computer. single player is worth it alone. gta online is worth it alone.",27.5
"this by far the best pc game i have played in a long time i wasnt 100% sure i could run this game at a decent fps because gta 4 was bad for fps on my old hd7750 but i got to say i get better frame rate with this then a game thats older my hat is off to rockstar for that. this is a must have game and it was worth the wait if you are considering getting it then you should just do it also go for if you arent its still a must have and i rarely say that",23.7

"no i dont recommend this game. i am quite certain i would, but the game refuses to launch. am i suprised a rockstar game doesnt work on launch? no. not even slightly. every time i launch the game it opens the game launcher, seemingly required in every new game, because clearly launching from steam doesnt distinguish it is a valid game. it goes through about ten seconds of attempting to activate my copy of the game, and then proceeds to fail. the great part is, not even the launcher works. every time i click the retry button, the launcher closes. then i have to reopen the game yet again, go through the samn damn process, and watch it fail again. i am seriously one step away from refunding this game and saying  you rockstar. i loved this game on console...too bad the pc version delayed 3 times doesnt work. edit: seriously how do i get this refunded. im not having this",0.5
"i remember the day when my friends told me id never experience gta 5 on the pc when it first released, i kept my comments to myself, knowing that when gta iv released it took them 9 months for it to come over to the pc. 2 years later i pre-odered the game, hoping and praying this game wouldnt turn out terrible....and to my surprises, with some of the launch problems, and rubber banding during online play, rockstar really did make this game one of my favorite games of all times. it runs flawless on my gaming pc, it isnt a beastly rig, has medium specs to it, but damn even with all my graphics set to normal/high, the game runs 40-50 fps in cities, and over 60 in the mountains and blaine county. online is funny as hell, playing with friends is amazing, running from the cops, to holding up store clerks for money, to heists, they really have made the best version of gta 5 possible. if you already havent purchased this game, open your wallets and buy it now. if you asked for a refund, buy the game again. this is the best game of the year for me, and i will be playing it years from now with friends, and i promise you its worth every minute, hour, and dime you put into it.",57.8

"so everything is better then the console versions of this from xbox 360 to ps4 this is a great game even if your not interested in the online but cmon we all know thats why you want it. only downside is when alt tabbed the game decides it doesnt want to reopen when using programs like ts, skype and ventrilo but thats not that bad.",49.3
"while at the time of writing this there is an error which makes it difficult to launch this game with an nvidia graphics cards, i still wholeheartedly recommend it. los santos could not be more beautiful and ornate and, speaking from the experience of having playing the ps4 version extensively, the smooth 60 fps is a magnificent change, and the optimization is perfect(almost worth the 500 day wait.) load times are much better too(although i shouldnt raelly compare a port this great to its console counterparts.) my only gripe about the game itself is a. that they didnt port saved outfits(minor, but noticeable) and b. that the camera in the map creator could use a little work. otherwise, wondeful job, well worth the money.",53.6
"welcome to los santos, where your fellow players are hostile  that will either murder you or murder your chances of completing a heist. also, the multiplayer loading times are ing ridiculous, and the chance of getting your crew of 4 together to play is lower than winning the ing lottery. however, this game is ridiculously fun, and lets you go on a rampage and kill rednecks, and you cant beat that. 10/10",54.2

"very impressive port for pc, i would highly recommend it. if you dont have any friends who have it or will be getting it then i do not recommend it. i have had it on xbox 360 and the graphics and expierence is higher in an extreme. i suggest you use a controller, but it is not very nessecary.(just depends on prefernce.) plus mods will be coming out soon im sure, so that will be fun. before you start or buy this game i highly suggest updating your graphics to the newest version. i do not know what it is currently is for nvidia but for amd it is 15.4 beta on the amd website.",24.1
"***day 4, still no fix. rockstar, not even a released statement saying anything regaurding this problem...*** a huge  you to about half the community from rockstar. wait 2 years for the came to come to pc preload for 7 hours wait 2 days for it to be released unpack for about an hour and a half. launch game, moment i have been waiting for my entire lilfe rockstar social club has stopped responding every time on launch verify integrity try atleast 7 different solutions nothing helps or fixes it. been waiting 2 years for gta v to come to pc, a week for it to be released after preloading it, a statement or a patch to be released for 4 days now, im done waiting. i actually want a refund for this because it guinenly does not work for me. im not smack talking or hating on the game, im stating that it doesnt work for me and anyone looking into this game should be wary about if they have amd hardware, because apparently it does not work with social club ui. i really really wanted to play this on pc because i could run it, but sadly social club ui crashing constantly prevents me from enjoying myself with gta v.",23.4
"well, it seems rockstar did a good port this time, unlike they did with gta iv. i`m having no issues so far. the game runs great on my mid-range pc, and it looks way better than it did on my ps3.",10.1
"great game! a must buy for any previous rockstar fans or new fans alike!!",47.2
"it seems a bunch of people have issues with getting this game to run. regardless of this my review will not be negative and i will try to help people out in this way: if you are a bullguard user, you might have the problem that your launcher will not start at all! this is what i did to fix this: open up bullguard and go to the general settings under settings. there will be an option there called selfprotection (allow bullguard to protect itself from termination, (or something similar) turn this off and reboot your computer, chances are great your launcher will now start normally! :d now for my actual review: have not played the game much, but i love the gta franchise and even though this game has had its fair share of problems on the pc i am still not gonna be negative about the games. the game looks great and what i have seen from other people playing and what i have played myself the game is loads of fun!! go get it!",23.5

"great preformance on any build, currently getting 60fps 1080p on high no problem. game is fun as one would expect with a gta game. 9.5/10. good job rockstar, it was worth the weight.",17.7
"i skipped all the console versions of this game, but what i can say that the engine is an improvement compared to gta iv, and runs pretty good on my machine. i cant play the game on the best settings but i dont mind, most settings are on normal or high, did need to disable msaa/fxaa, but at least i can play in 1920x1080 with 60 fps most of the time. from what i have seen i love the storyline with the different characters and the online mode gives you enough hours of playtime. whatever mode you play in, you will eventually run into awesome moments. at this moment i play the game with keyboard and mouse when on foot or in verhicles and a xbox 360 controller when flying, because the default numlock controls used for flying are horrible. one other downside is that my saitek x52 or any other joystick aint supported by the game, only xbox 360 controllers are supported. i would like to see this feature in the future or hope that i will get some xbox 360 controller emulator working in combination with my joystick.",43.7
"arguably the best pc port rockstar has done. it runs surprisingly well.. and im on a laptop. occasional frame drops during cut scenes, but other than that, mostly smooth frame rate. driving with a mouse and keyboard feels fine and somewhat weighted, minus sports cars. gamepad recommended for aircraft. the fov for fps mode requires a gander at, but i wouldnt recommend it if you are susceptible to nausea or motion sickness. overall, a solid port, minus low res textures during fps mode. this is arguably the best in the franchise.",22.1

"grand theft auto 5, well.. first of all its a brilliant game even for being two years old on the consoles, its definatley worth the purchase, if you have a couple of friends too, this game becomes too fun! i have spent too many hours laughing really hard that my jaw starts to ache. so yes, i highly recommend this game! so the downsides to gta v on the pc that i have found so far. unexpected game crashes - yes i have the latest drivers. random fps drops.. that could be just me but for some reason my game runs at a nice and steady framerate then all of a sudden drops to 1-3 for like 4 seconds and then straight back to normal. final bad point that i can think of, the servers, even though a couple of my mates and myself have a decent connection, we still find that they are bouncing all over the roads when doing races. the same for ai traffic too! overall, i rate this game a 8/10 and would highly recommend buying this game.",23.2
"grand theft auto might be the best gta game ive ever played, there is some issues, where for example, when i want to switch my graphics to med-high, it want to restart the game to load the graphics, but when it starts again, it goes into 800x600 in resolution and windowed mode, and all normal graphics with vsync, wich can be quite annoying, but otherwise its an amazing game, and i recommend this game for everyone who likes to drive cars into people and shoot old/fat people!",11.7
"wait till all the issues are resolved. pro: - amazing graphics -fun!!!!!!!!!!!!! -online gameplay -cars,bikes,helicopters,planes,boats -mansions,appartments cons: - tons of issues and glearing buggs (as to be expected) - stuttering - connectivity issues , crashes - hours of hair pulling",24.8

"realy nice game. the graphics are just beautifull. i think to play on high-end you need atleast 8gb ram, else you could play on 720p. the story mode is as fun as the online mode. there is just a lil problem, when the nat of your network is set to strict you may not be able to play online, but you can fix that in the router settings i guess. however i highly recommend this game cuz its so fun. so we will soon meet online then huh? ;3 -biscuit",46.3

(much better than console which is gritty-360) the fps gameplay is definitely immersive, this game is worth the $60. not only will the story take you long enough, but going online just adds an infinite amount of additional gameplay hours. play by yourself, with a friend, or a stranger and youll have a great time!",13.6

"i want to first say, well done rockstar. what a great game you have made for pc. everything about gta v for pc is amazing. the graphics, the story and support for widescreen displays.

"dear steam users, when i first downloaded gta v, i was not able to launch the game. when i tried to launch it, my steam said i was playing but only for a few seconds. then nothing happened. confused was i so i decided to do some research. there seemed to be a glitch among portable graphics cards that would not allow the game to launch (i use my trusty asus g750 notebook with an 860m gpu). i tried multiple times, but nothing woud work. after countless attempts, i left for class furiously. i ressolved to give the game a nasty review, but then it happened. just as i sat down to write my strongly worded review, i tried to start my game up one more time. behold, it launched! from that point forward, i have been robbing banks, winning races, and claiming glorious victory! the gameplay was smooth and very nice. after that first hicup, i experienced no other problems with gta 5. for this reason, i recomend this game, and i hope you enjoy it just as i have. p.s. i do not have the slightest idea what i did to fix it.... sorrrrrrrr. sincerely, king vulture",25.9

"edit: as of waking up on the 16th after a format, while gta v loaded all night, i managed to get it running, whether it was a update from rock star or blind luck. good luck guys. launcher has stopped working. have spent over 6 hours doing a lot of different things to try and fix it, even reinstalled over night. dont waste your money. wait for the game to go on sale and the bugs should be fixed by then. edit: ive managed to get the game to update by using rockstars installer program (you can find it on the social club page) but now it just simply doesnt load the launcher, or the game. with this in total ive put about 8 hours into trying to get the game running. if anyones wondering why theres only 0.5 hours its because ive only had to run the launcher for a minute at a time for it to crash, and as of writing this review ive been using the non-steam installer so its not keeping log. ill try to keep updates on anything that fixes the problem for me. any shitposts will be deleted.",18.2
"so despite the problems people were having, i experienced non. this game is truely remarkable and might i add, the best sandbox game currently out. gta v ultimately became, what gta iv was supposed to be. online is awesome, casually get my crew and start blasting people away with a rhino or just casually going for a drive. gta v has it all, the activities could be expanded though, but hopefully r* will add some more features in the future, with the anunciation on activities. and ofcourse the main event. heists. heists with a full crew makes it all the more better. and if rockstar will continue support for this game, itll last for years just like the cs games.",84.3

"the single player works for me but that is not why i purchased this game. i purchased this game with the intention of playing online with my friends. after 2 days of frustration and no help from rockstar, i chose to get a refund through steam. it would never let me play online and would only say cannot initiate communication with rockstar servers. i couldnt find a fix online. maybe they will fix it soon but i expected to be able to play on launch day. not worth my 60$.",21.0

"the single-player story is an exhilarating series of increasingly fun missions. and if you have the muscle to run it at max settings, the visual fidelity is astonishing. driving through the city at night in a storm, neon signs reflecting in the puddles and on the rain-slicked hood of your car, it almost looks photorealistic. and it all takes place in one of the richest, densest, most skillfully constructed game worlds ever built. the sense of place these details evoke is lightyears ahead of other open-world games. and the fact you can share it with other players makes it all the more exciting. gta online is a game in itself, mixing gtas sandbox chaos with elements of mmorpg. 10/10",51.3
"ok, the single playercampaing is really nice, cool characters, involving story etc. multiplayer, on the other hand is bad. matchmaking only works in this game if you have frineds, in this case you wouldnt spend hours in empty ques. because of the ques, there is literally nothing to do, yeah the races, store burglaries, stealing cars and deathmatches are all there, but guess what, you in a 2 hour gameplay you will spend 1 hour 45 minutes trying to find somebody to play with. and the loading times in multiplayer is insane. all this fuzz about heists, great times etc - i cant see, because frankly i dont have the patience for waiting instead of playing.",33.8

"fantastic game, i played it for 6 hours and decided to get the refund for it. the reason? i already owned the ps3 version and decided that $60 wasnt worth the small amount of upgrades in this version, plus my computer cant run it with max graphics. when in about 4 years when it goes on sale for like $10 and i have a better pc, i will defintley buy this again. so if youre someone who already has this on ps3/xbox 360/ps4/xbox one then i recommend waiting for a much lower price, but if youve never experiences gta v before, then buy this, now, dont even wait for a sale, just spend that 60 dollars.",6.7
"in this review i will be reviewing this version of the game as it stacks up to the other versions. graphically its outstanding, you cant really get any better on the console versions. too bad for a large percent of users the port is riddled with problems (like the one where you cant load jobs online without your game crashing) i am finding it hard to recommend this game in its current state, since it seems to be a flip of the coin wether or not it will actually run consistently without crashing.",47.5

"not as good as i expected. still cant beat san andreas. open world is not offering a lot of choices. almost all misions are about riding from place to place or killing some dudes and side missions are terrible (expect the weed smoking one). however dialogs are perfect and models are good too. begginers will have trouble with the multiplayer which is kinda messy. of course it is one of the best games for a long time but rockstar could do much more with resources that other companies miss. they put way more time to make a perfect city then they should have. i guess metacritic overrated it with 97/100.",45.3

"the game runs fine for me. overall the game is a solid story you should get if you want to see how it plays out. you are given the option to skip quests if you fail them too many times. the only bad thing about this game some systems wont run it or some systems run it at very low settings. people have been vocal about that part. as well as it links your socail club account(online) with whatever email you used to pay for the game. keep that in mind. i like it so far. i would pay for it again. overall good game. should research if you can run it and other stuff to be safe.",61.1

"this is a great game that i would strongly recomend to anyone who loves just cause, other gta instalments or even open world adventure/action games. it has a vast array of activities or missions from killing cops to doing yoga (as featured in one of the many trailers). although it may be fun, the many activities are kind of a selling point for the game and generally they give way to the imfamous ultra-violence typical to gta. basically, some of the games are used only to boast of the games size and people maily will ignore them. i strongly recomend that you read and compare the system requirements due to the fact that it is a very demanding game and that playing gta 5 in 600x800 with half a second delay is, while semi-playable, extremly disapointing and worth nowhere near the cost of the game. i would deffinetly recomend the game to any casual or extreme gamer as it is an all-round fun time (+ we pc gamers get to laugh at the console players trying to aim on controller!!!).",0.3

"ps4 version looks and runs better. it can feel nice for a bit at 60fps but frequent frame drops destroy the experience. there is also a very restrictive graphics options menu, as in you can change the options but the game will not let you play the game if it thinks you are out of memory. this can happen often as the game does not pick up on multiple graphics cards and large amounts of ram. a better port than gtaiv but its still not a high enough quality to warrant purchasing this version. only buy if you have a rig way above the reccomended settings and can afford a new hard drive because this is a resource hog and a disgusting large game to install. all in all the order for gta v goes ps4/xbone > pc >360/ ps3.",1.4

"for the most part, this game is great. its everything a pc gamer wants from a game. great storyline, fantastic graphics, 60 fps, you name it. but there is one thing that is so serverly aggravating that it is preventing me from giving this a good review. its the fact that every single time i try to join gta online, it forces me to sign into to social club. dosent sound bad, right? well, the issue is, every single time i try to log in nothing happens. absolutly nothing. in fact, when i sign in, it actually logs me out of the game, forcing me to restart my game. i cannot join online because when i sign in it sits on the sign in screen and does, as i mentioned before, absolutly nothing. it dosent look like its trying to sign in, it dosent look like its trying to do anything at all. so now my friend and i cannot play online together, which is a huge shame considering how everything else about this port is amazing. its almost as if i can only play 50% of the game, because gta online is such a huge part of the game. hopefully, rockstar games will fix this issue. if that is to happen, i will change my review for sure.",21.7

"the only technical issue ive had was connecting to rockstars social club at the begining. this howevever only lasted 10 minutes. the game dosent crash for me and runs pretty smoothly with an nivida gtx 660 graphics card and 8 gigs of ram. i notice that some of the people that are having issues dont have the recomended pc specs and thats why. the game is amazing and online is working great considering the game just came out on pc. 10/10 game and 9/10 port. note: if you want to have a good onlne experience dont be a tool, if youre a tool rockstar will put you in groups with other tools. 10/10",86.2

"the game is giant, full of content, innovation, the storyline is interesting, every mission is interesting, nothing you do feels repetitive, the game easily immerses you into its world, having 3 characters, to me, feels like rockstar covered every single point of view that you usually get from gta protagonists, franklin for the times of gta: sa, michael for every other protagonist, and trevor for those crazy rampages you used to go on for no reason, just because its fun to kill people. currently, gta: online is full of annoying bugs and is barely playable, the servers put you in with people all across the world, chinese, australian, which makes playing with them impossible due to lag, and ruins the overall experience, rockstar has a lot to fix before online becomes fun, but you can still go ahead and give it a try.",55.8

"played on ps3, and it was great. i couldnt wait to get my hands on this on pc and just play the way its meant to be. but... rough launch issues are killing the hype and happiness: 1) launcher crashes unless i disable my nvidia card from the device manager first. 2) game content takes too long to load, causing missing textures, models, animations, sounds. 3) can get 60fps on lowest graphics on this old laptop, but cpu usage is sawtooth and it fluctuates between 17fps and 60fps in about 2 seconds, and it keeps repeating this pattern, making the game more or less unplayable. 4) got a 16gb ssd, one of those first ones. game files are not grouped in a folder > i cant symlink the files > slow loading times. game aspects: great! technical aspects: not so much. do i recommend? if you have an ssd big enough to keep the entirety of the game, and a relatively good computer: yes. rockstar, please patch the game, i want to get my moneys worth.",60.8

"im going to give this game a negative review for now and may change it later. the online is a complete mess and needs to be completely redone. rockstar needs to go back to the mess of max paine 3 and really figure out what needs to be done to correct gta 5 online. with lag a core issue which leads to teleporting players, vehicles, 90 degree turns that should not happen, and miss leading damage to other players when pvping. the load times to are terrible especially when trying to get into online with friends. the lobby play is nice but when the matches are done you should not be thrown out of a session if your playing with only friends and have to constantly have to resend invites. flying the planes/helicopters to me need to be tweeked alittle because they are alittle clunky. ive seen to many times heists bug out at certain parts and becoming stuck in a loading screen. the only thing im going to give positive for the game is the single player. the graphix are flawless with a amazing storyline. i could spend alot of hours playing only single player because of the replayability. like i said i may give the game a positive review but once more patches come out the game should hopefully be amazing.",59.6

"overall the pc version is 110% better than the console versions. id recommend it if you enjoyed the game on console and the only issue (not a huge deal) that i have is the flight controls. theyre just kinda hard to get used to at first. i went ahead and changed the controls so that the mouse controls the pitch and stuff for the planes and helicopters. also, i turned the sensitivity for the mouse during flight way down...just gives it an easier feel i think. murdered a hooker with a hatchet 10/10",47.4

"right, so you can disregard a majority of the negative reviews on steam for gta v since rockstar has recently rolled out an update to fix issues related to their launcher, and just go right ahead and click purchase on one of the best (if not the best) games released. theres a reason that metacritic score is so high... ;)",23.7

"overall this was one of the better ports that has come out in the last year. unlike a lot of games, it has been optimized really well and im able to play on high/very high with a gtx 660 and get around 50-60 fps. the only bug ive had is that the screen freezes up sometimes after restarting a heist and this can easily be fixed by changing something in the video settings and changing it back.",26.8
"had no idea how much left-wing garbage was in this game. i tolerate a hell of a lot, but i watched about 5 minutes of a fake tv show in this game and perused a couple of fake websites in the game, and the entire thing is absolute left-wing satirical trashing of the right. stephen colbert may have well been the games starring character. i cant believe i gave these ers money. aside from the leftist garbage, the game requires 125+ gigabytes of free space to complete the installation process. that is outrageous.",5.8

"this game is good graphically, very good visuals even for an older pc like my own. for that reason i will give it a thumbs up. the story is very diversified, lots of different situations arise with generally unique results. however, this series suffers from one drawback, considering i tend to enjoy having choices now; there is a distinct lack of choice in how the story goes. this, in my opinion, lowers the re-playability value of the game. while being a great game visually, not having the amount of room that one had back in gtasa is disappointing, not to mention missing some sort of choice making. but i will admit, thats another publishers tendency and not r*s.",2.4

"after watching the positive pc port report video totalbiscuit made i figured gta v would be a great pick up, but unfortunately i ran into so many issues rightaway that i ended up requesting a refund which was still an option due to the other problems the game had. issues i had: - jerky/laggy mouse movement in the menu. changing vsync or mouse input didnt help. - settings didnt save after quitting the game and restarting - display calibration screen on every start - benchmark crashed to desktop after a 3 minute black screen - fps tied to sensitivity (not this crap again, sigh) i run a i7-4790k, 16 gb, r9 290x machine and from what i could see from my short experience, the actual framerate ingame is fine so performance seems ok otherwise. this is the first refund ive ever requested and im glad it was still an option. fully priced games, in this case even more, should always have an option for refunds to avoid these sorts of things. one thing steam could learn from origin. i hope they patch the game and fix all these issues because i am certain the underlying game is brilliant, but i just cant support it while theres so many problems before even getting to the actual playing part.",0.8

"review for gta v online from programmer and game designer perspective. - gta v online feels just as crappy as a singleplayer with simple networking slapped on top of it. nothing technically amazing with a sloppy game design. - loading screen and lobby waiting problems are much worse than in left4dead2. - your are forced to connect to open world and spawn in it every time you want to join a lobby, what takes a lot of time. - there is no open world, but only separate world instances with only up to 32 players. - bad community. everybody loves steamrolling noobs who dont know about enter passive mode button. why it isnt enabled by default for new players ? - learning curve, you will need somebody to hold your hand when you just start playing. - barely achieves high fps and playable game smoothness on notebooks with gt 750m videocard. verdict: kinda nice game to play when youve got nothing else to do. but i do not recommend playing it online alone without friends. if you are buying it just for online features - its not worth the money.",7.8

"ive already played this game on console so the hours played are not correct... with that said. the game is way different from console. i mean... it is the same game. but it feels and plays much better. i max out the game and rarely get below 60 fps. if i ever do i get like 55 fps... not a big deal. so rockstar did a great job porting the game. it seems people are having issues logging in to the social club. i never had that problem. my friend did though. his steam name had a dot at the end (name.). once he removed that dot he was able to log in. it has something to do with the social club not working with certain symbols. the game: the story is crazy and filled with even crazier people. the longer you get through the game the more fun it becomes. i love the characters though i think rockstar did a much better job in red dead redemption when it comes to personalities. the world is filled with stuff to do so you will never be bored. if you somehow get bored theres always the multiplayer. ive not tried it yet on pc... but i can say the console version had a ton of variety in community made maps and game modes. i am sure the creativity of the pc gamers will outdo what has already been done.",19.0

"gta five is a game in which you can do things that mimic real life. for instance you can play tennis, or ride a bike, or drive a car. the game heavily encourages players to partake in a number of criminal activities, such as gang turf wars and robbing convenience stores. however i have found it personally rewarding making my money legally, like winning car and parachute races! no matter what kind of lifestyle you choose, gta five has got you covered. 10/10 avoid this game at all costs if you dont like wonderful things.",56.8
"amazing pc port !! runs butter smooth @ 1920x1080 on my gtx 970 with almost all the bells and whistles turned on (and it does offer a huge variety of video options). the graphical fidelity is outstanding -esp. for an open world game. i am very happy they didnt dumb it down unlike so many other contemporary pc ports. beware of the ~ 60 gb download / hard disc space requirement though. the game also seems to be using up almost all of my 4096 mb video memory. so if you have a mid range pc, i suggest disabling anti aliasing and turning the texture quality sliders down a notch to ensure smooth gameplay. im not even gonna waste time reviewing the actual gameplay/storyline as this game has been out on consoles for almost 2 years now. but for us pc players it was certainly worth the wait. brb overclocking my gpu so i can crank up the msaa even more ... #justmasterracethings",9.8

(1) the game actually has a fairly interesting story. i find myself not skipping the cut scenes for the most part. (2) being able to switch between characters is really cool. (3) fps!! first person mode is really cool. i like being able to switch when i want (4) graphics. wow! the game looks so pretty on my 5820k/gtx980 combo. (5) smooth. the game feels so smooth at release -unlike watchdogs which is still a buggy mess. (6) the game will still provide hours of entertainment even after you finish it. conclusion. it was worth the wait. but, with all of the money they have made, they better hire some more people so that gta vi gets released on all platforms at the same time, like every other normal company does.",36.9

"this game is good but not perfect sometimes it will run sometimes it wont even open but it will patch itself up and im looking forward to more rockstar produced games and hope they fix gta 5 online.",21.6

"60 fps on max setting great preformance overall just had a minor problem when installing the game took about an hour and a half just to install 200 mbs for some reason but nothing too bad and mods are gonna be ing amazing",14.2
"so far really dissapointed, lots of lag and freezing,without these lags and freezes game runs like a charm so they did something good there but still for me its unplayable due to these freezes and lags , i even tried it on low settings but same issue( my rig is above recommended ) and ofcourse the cloud servers have issues saving progress once in a while ( before fanbois cry this has nothing to do with my rig ;) ). and today for some reason my garage got bugged and i lost 2 of my expensive cars which were fully upgraded ( i am a returning player from xbox 360 ) and now each time i put a car there it gets duplicated but the duplicated one does nto really exist but still takes up the garage slot to park a car. if you want to play the game without issues and problems, stay away from it for 1 month and then try, hopefully rockstar has solved these issues.",92.4
"from a gameplay perspective, you probably know everything there is to know about this game. from a port perspective, i have to say this version is phenomenal. graphically superior to every other platform and well optimized to the core, like the max payne 3 port.",4.5

"if you have an ssd and meet the system requirements then i would suggest this game highly. it runs like a beut on my 780 ti. this game is no port mind you, there are so many new things ive seen within the world from the consoles that it blows me away. even if you havent played the earlier gta games you will still love this immersive experience that it provides.",72.9
"my mom told me to get a life while i was playing gtaiv... i cried so hard and whacked my xbox apart--my little brother thought the whole building was coming down... but, hold on, finally, after 765 days wating... im able to get a life. gta is love, gta is life. 10/10",59.8

"beastly optimization, a brand new experience compared to console!",22.1
"it does have the same good features of the console version but youd need a very solid pc to run it efficiently. i particularly had problems with playing gta online. shame really as thats what i was looking forward to. my pc was made with gaming in mind but it struggles with this game. only purchase if you have the hardware to go for it. the recommended specifications are where your pc specs should be minimally. you have been warned!",1.1

"warning: for those with motion sickness issues. the game looks great! wish i could play it. seems like fun. i bought it .. played it for 30 mins or so.. got back motion sickness when when driving around. the way they did the camera work didnt agree with me. i turned off head-bopping in the menu, tried a bunch of other stuff. but it was still bad. i was able to get my purchase refunded from my account settings.",1.1
"runs at a consistent 60 fps with very high textures using my 4gb 770 gtx and an i7 4770k at 1080p. i was a little worried that the pc port would run poorly even on modern hardware like gta iv, but it seems to be very smooth considering it is a port. the settings claim to require 2300mb of vram so id imagine having a graphics card with only 2gb of vram wont be able to run this at max settings simply because of a vram bottleneck. invest in a 3gb+ graphics card or settle for slightly less than max settings. the game is beautiful at high resolution and high fps. this is a much better experience than my original playthrough on the xbox 360 when it was first released.",38.4

"when i first saw that gta v would come to pcs, i was kind of skeptical, but i bought it anyway. turns out the graphics are amazing, i also realized how ugly  my online character was, and the campaign is still just as fun. oh yeah, and i should mention: no 12 year olds!",31.7

"this piece of garbage keeps crashing. totally unplayable - crashes as soon as i drive off with lamar on the very first mission. ive had to trouble shoot and research countless message boards with friends who are pc experts themselves and we cannot find a solution - countless hours wasted. the game is playable for them with minor crashes from time to time however. if you do not have time to f**k around like myself,l maybe a wait a while before purchasing this game as it is not 100% complete. there are multitudes of threads online regarding crashes and issues such as: gta 5 pc mega crash thread. utterly dissappointed with this multi million dollar company who could have invested a little more in ensuring a much more successful launch for all. great game? yes it was on the ps3 despite many bugs and issues but it was still playable. but on pc? perhaps wait for rockstar to iorn out the s**t they should have done int he first place and purchase this game when the prices come down.",28.4
"ive changed my review from negative to positive. it took 3 days, but rockstar finally fixed the bugs that made the launch day a failure. im still never preordering another game, though.",45.3
"this game took 2 days too install after finaly being able to run it ive never gotten past a not responding screen unfourtunite yes expected duh! if you pre-order guys expect a broken game thats why they give dlc content. so again yes i cant wait to play this game but after spending 2 hours im not going to reinstall again instead ill check back every 24hrs till it works i guess haa",1.3

"ok, first, i have to say: why dont you already have this game? and secondly, if you do own the game and are just reading the reviews for chuckles, hello! the silly review (since this game deserves it): upon playing the first time, i was pulled over by a police officer in the small truck-stop town of paleto bay, while driving a rusty tractor down the interstate. probably for going too slow on my journey back to los santos and holding many a semi truck back. then, while waiting for the officer to come around to me, i see his car and him scooting by, being rammed by a small pickup. the pickup was then blown up by a sniper team in a helicopter, for assaulting an officer. continued to los santos on my tractor without further interruption. the serious review: uhhh... later. ive, uhm, still gotta finish the game. pc forever!",64.7

"if youve ever dreamed of going to the movies, and having the movie tell you to press some buttons to get from scene to scene, then gta v will make your dreams come true. 9/10 movie 4/10 gameplay id recommend this game if it was cheaper, but its not worth $60. #buyersremorse",32.6

"gta v single player might be fun but i havent played it except to unlock online. im bored of gta online. something about the level/money grind, random ai headshots thatll instantly kill you, and the sync system that would rather sync the random civilians, weather and traffic than position data across the internet. the fact it plays more like a tactical cover shooter yet 90% of missions are out in the open with tons of nothing between you and the enemy and the fact the online is kind of annoying in how you have to spend more time setting up a game with friends than it takes to join a bunch of random s. also fps stutters which when tied to the problems of online play makes it a bigger mess.",53.4
"ive played the console versions of this game and it is fair to say that this is worth the wait. gameplay was great in both 3rd and 1st person mode (dont recommend first person if you have motion sickness), the cars didnt feel slippery, the campaign feels like sort of episodic (if i spelt that right) and the graphics were impressive. especially on the last gen versions of the game. 10/10 ps. be prepared to run into high level pr*cks going on a rampage in their tank on the online portion of the game",7.8
"wont run, crashes on start up, it isnt the windows accoutn problem. rip.",0.4

"gta v has been the best game ever, with the loads of activities you can do in the game you can never get bored. this game has the best replay value by far with the extraordinary campaign and online multiplayer to play with friends. although this game has been delayed for pc for over a year it is worth it. the gunplay of this game is good, if you dont prefer using keyboard thats alright because you can switch over to controller with ease-i use controller though but either way this is a must buy game.",11.1
"solid gameplay, great performance on pc, insanely rich visuals, tons of details and content...this was worth the wait and blows gta4 out of the water. i daresay its one of the greatest games in the recent decade. my laptop specs: win 7 64 bit gen 3 quad-core i7 2.3ghz 8gb ram nvidia gt 650m 2gb ddr5 vram 1tb 5400rpm hdd",15.4

"i bought this to play gta online on pc. well constant server problems due to rockstar made that impossible. the issue is not on my end and there is several thousands reporting the same issue. so to warn you all if you are buying this with the expectations to play online forget about it. rockstar will never fix the network issue which have been around on ps3/4 and xbox since launch (almost 2 years) for the people who did the same mistake as me and bought it, you actually have a option to ask for a full refund from steam regardless how many days ago you bought it. grab the opportunity while you still have it!",40.3

"played the game for a day now, did a few missions, drove and messed around a bit. i was loving gta 3, was seriously hyping on vice city (cause i love the era), havent played san andreas at all (computer not powerfull enough at the time) and was okay with gta 4. so far i am having a blast. the performance is great, even on my sub-par computer. it even manages to look good on lowest settings (which are called normal instead of low or some such thing, nice touch!). its the first full priced game i have bought in a long time, and i am pretty sure i wont regret it. full recommendation for fans of the genre! there are a few glitches, like massive fps drop now and again for a second or four, but its manageable and it never happened in a mission so far. some cutscenes were a bit off sync. have to stop writing now and resume playng ;)",31.0

"i hate steams rating system... needs to be points based. if i had to choose 0-10, 10 being outstanding id choose a 8. so far ive only played about an 10 hours, and come in with very high expectations. it worked on first launch, no crashes or glitches. i set my graphics to my monitors resolution of 1920x1080 and set several a few items to high, but left most at normal (including textures). i only have an nvidia 570 card so i cant go extreme. i chose to ignore overlimit warnings, and went over the memory allocation slightly. the game still runs perfectly smooth for me so far so i may try increasing a few more settings. with my intel i7 4770k and 16gb ram, running on windows 10 preview x64. ive only played the story mode so far, but so far seems fun in typical gta fashion. ill make a few more reviews as i progress in the game.",14.6

"very good game the controls should be more like need for speed as the cars go out of control realy easy",11.8
"rockstar can suck my , absolutely no support for those who cannot play the game because of their  perma link to steam accounts... so if you bought the game on a different account not activated to steam rockstar will take outs its big willy and shuv it down your throat and make you wait 1 month to answer a ticket that will probably not help. because giving the power of unlinking your steam account to the customer is too much to handle and would give them a god complex.  you, ruined my day/week.",35.1

"all about this game is fantastic. pros; - realistic visual - great storyline - fun gameplay - many people play multiplayer cons: this is not big problem for many people but for me auto repair is make game unrealistic and make repair option is useless. i really hope rockstar make an update that allow player choose enable/disable auto repair for online and offline.. its bit annoying for me. but all is still great. good game",41.6

"story isnt great, neither the characters. the supposed irony and social comentary isnt there, dont believe people who says that. its a silly story, with lame supporting cast and bland main cast - excluding trevor, he grows on you. so far, the worst gta story and characters wise. but the best gta technically. its a beautiful game in every aspect and an exemplary port. rockstar did its homework this time: the game is an extraordinary port, really well optimized and ridiculously pretty graphics. even the physics improved in the porting process. gta v on pc is the ultimate experience for this game, believe me. san andreas state is the strongest character youll ever need for this game, followed by the beautifully accomplished vehicles of all sorts and amazing weather effects. oh, and theres the somewhat smooth online experience. if your pc falls between the minimum and recommended specs, just buy it. you wont regret.",42.7

"the latest update completley broke my game, i have a 290x and a i5 3570k and on my old settings or even the lowest settings, i cant hold 60fps anymore, the amount of pop in freezing and stutter made me ill. i have had buildings and roads vanish right in front of me then re appear, and when that happens my framerate tanks to ~20fps. its an amazing game pre update, my favorite pc game in a loooong time, but after this update its unplayable",76.5
"great game runs great looks great dont listen to the trolls who talk crap about it they are full of it and dont understand half the graphic settings in the first place",39.1
"ok, first, i have to say: why dont you already have this game? and secondly, if you do own the game and are just reading the reviews for chuckles, hello! the silly review (since this game deserves it): upon playing the first time, i was pulled over by a police officer in the small truck-stop town of paleto bay, while driving a rusty tractor down the interstate. probably for going too slow on my journey back to los santos and holding many a semi truck back. then, while waiting for the officer to come around to me, i see his car and him scooting by, being rammed by a small pickup. the pickup was then blown up by a sniper team in a helicopter, for assaulting an officer. continued to los santos on my tractor without further interruption. the serious review: uhhh... later. ive, uhm, still gotta finish the game. pc forever!",65.5
"i wonder what its going to feel like to be game of the year twice. 9.5/10 (.5 bc why cant i connect online.)",27.8
"game looks absolutely stunning with everything maxed, seems to run pretty smooth too. all playable characters are pretty well likable, first person is nice, guns are enjoyable, as are the cars. edit: had not installed the new driver that just came out, doing so now! the starting money from preorder is good, i didnt really read into it much but i think the cash bonus is only for the starting character, unless im ment to do something to trigger it for the other ones, i dunno.. doesnt worry me though, i spent all of my money on guns and car mods within the hour... -_- whups.",76.2

"60 hrs into gta v and all i can say is  yeah!!!! this game is game of the year 2015 hands down, graphics are sweet, it runs smooth, a few minor bugs at launch but nothing gamebreaking perhaps the smoothest launch of any aaa game i have ever played.. huge thumbs up.. thanks r*.",87.2
"i can see the delays were well worth it. the game runs smoothly on max settings and is well optimised. this is a port well done, my money was well spent.",79.8
"i love this game.there are way too many things that are great about it to even know where to begin. but just to start there was obviously a huge amount of time and thought that went into this the open world is not only vast with tons of things to explore but its also well thought out and interesting not just huge and the graphics of this game are incredible and the physics....well let me finish by saying if i could only buy a single game this year it would have to be this one.....enjoy!!!",19.4

"worth every second of wait entailed, the polish and performance is mind boggling",47.6

"solid performace, great stuff. the graphics options were limiting me short of my computers capabilities, once i disabled the limiter, i was able to set everything on ultra and ran the game perfectly fine.",66.7
"got hacked, no response from rockstar support 10/10 would play again",32.7
"i keep it short, i will list the good and bad things about this game; good: + open world with a lot of stuff to do. + first person view. + many options for video and controls etc. + wide variety of vehicles. bad: - too many things force you into cutscenes or scripted events. - no full customization in single player mode. - long loading times during activities in online mode. - no fluent transition between sandbox play and doing activities, everything will force you into menus and loading screens. - main story characters switch to their default clothes every time you switch character. - unreliable system to store vehicles, vehicles might disappear and its impossible to buy bicycles even when having an empty garage. - forced to play with story characters you might not like and having to sit trough every degenerate thing they say and do is painful. it could learn a thing or two from the saints row games when it comes to customization and fluent game play, but its still a decent game overall, i would rate it a 7/10.",21.6
"superb game in history of gta best game ever for open world <3",7.0
"so far, yes its worth the money. solid port, my logitech orion spark keyboard even lights up based on which character i use as well as wanted level. nice touch! gamepad works nicely and comes in handy if you like it, my only complaint is losing cars after i mod them, and thats really my own fault. 2 thumbs up. p.s. zero time played in multi-player.",42.2

"this is by far the best version of gta v i have ever played. smooth, beautiful, intense, 60 fps. me and three of my brothers got this game (pc guys), and never have we had so much fun playing a game. its got car chaces, full on wars happening in the streets, random  exploding, its dead fun! i highly recommend this to anyone who has a heart and brain. if this game doesnt sound fun to you, then god save you because youre possesed by some demon if you dont like it.",83.8
"waited for the pc version for eighteen months - only played the intro but the game is gorgeous on max settings and runs very smoothly. disregarding the 60 gb download, i dont get the technical issues people are having. stop using toasters and ridiculous windows user names.",4.8
"this game is ing unbelieveable i ve been impressed you should get it as soon as you can dont waste your money on stupid games like cod buy this game and youll not regret",48.5
"finally managed to install it without getting lag/fps drops. love the game, of the best gta games ever made.",24.4
"graphic is 10/10 getting 60 rate. took half my hard drive space and well worth it 60.6 or more gigs for the game.",24.6
"worth every penny, great game! runs really well on my laptop, with 40=50 fps on almost ultra!",28.4
"amazing game, rockstar obviously wanted to do the best delivery of a game they could and even if they didnt, that was achieved anyway but im sure they were. amazing graphics, better than any console graphics, 60fps makes it so much better and feel like youre actually there at times when youre in the amazing... 1st person mode! which you get on ps4 and xbox one anyway but still it looks way better on the pc. director mode makes it way better aswell because you can play as so many different characters and costumed characters which is alot of fun when bored in the game. definitely recommended (if you have a graphics card of atleast radeon hd 7770) but it might look alright on a lower one, but yeah definitely recommended!",16.4
"short answer: this game is a must-own. buy at earliest convienience. fantastic game, fantastic pc version - highly recommended. online is great for a laugh with mates, and the singleplayer is one of the best open-world sandboxes i have ever had the pleasure to play around in. story is great too, shooting is very max payne-esque (this is a good thing), driving is fun, exciting and fast, and the attention to detail is incredible, as usual from rockstar. either get this game now if you cant wait, or just wait for it to go on sale. either way, this title is a must own. pc version note: my only advice is for you to please make sure your pc is up to spec. a lot of the bad reviews are coming from people have not ensured their rig can handle this game, so before you purchase take a look at the system specs down below and see if youre okay. other than that, this game runs great on my rig.",39.2
"i dont since tried to fix social club error for 5 hours now. tried everything they recommend and more. now redowloading and isntalling again",70.9
"cannot get it to start up, social club has stopped working at any and every attempt,",6.4
"its so weird, if you are one of those 1/4 of all the players where the game does not want to stop crashin. -> bought the game -> issues with social club. (unable to start gta v, please reinstall) ===> keep in mind, reinstalling takes about 14-18 hours via steam -> didnt reinstall, restarted the pc 3 times then it worked for a few minutes -> played online crashin every 10-30 minutes -> found out that u r able to see statistics. how many player killed, time played, time for every session ===> average time spend per session: 20 minutes ===> i like the idea that rockstar has statistic how often my game crashes per hour and its obviously every 20 minutes ===> when u play heists which sometimes take 2 hours with 4 players in the game, u begin to cry uncontroled and fapping at the same time when ur game crashes tip for the crashers if your game crashes permanently: change graphic direct x 11 to direct x 10 and put off fxaa and mxa. then my game only crashes every 1 - 3 hours. actualy social club is offline so 6/10 for this game because i even keep on playin when its crashin every 20 minutes then i begin fapping and crying",71.3

"could you rockstar guys please stop counting the money you have got from us and solve the switchable graphics problem? that makes the game experience like !",29.7
"dont rely on rockstar support to ever give you any assistance with this game. due to a stupid design feature you have to log into a rockstar social club account in order to play the game even if you do not want to use any of the on-line features. by their own admission a number of these accounts have been compromised (or in plain english hacked) mine being one of them. as this rockstar account is linked to my steam account i am now unable to play a game which has cost me nearly 40 uk pounds. rockstar supports answer to my logged requests for assistance ? absolutley nothing. thank you so very much rockstar.",27.6
"horrible, horrible port. i meet recommended requirements (except the 8gb ram part - i have 4gb), and the game is barely playable. scratch that, after the prologue its unplayable, with all its stutters and graphical glitches, even on minimum settings. i cant recommend the game as it is (day one), and its beyond me how rockstar managed to release such a crappy product, even after all the delays.",2.4
"aside from the 10 hour 60gb download, the game is giving alot of people problems and rockstar is sitting on their asses counting money. i have put in a support ticket and followed up 6 times and no one has responded. the online freezes and crashes, a problem that many other people are having. on others forum posts, rockstar also has failed to reply. it seems as though they have absolutely no clue as to what is causing this problem prohibiting online and story play. totally unacceptable for it to be out this long and no patch for an issue making the game unplayable for some customers.",54.5
"no doubt this is the best version of gta v, just a shame it took this long to get here. optimization is pretty good but definitely could be better, the graphics looks stunning along with the improved pedestrian and traffic density. the settings is also pretty good with a lot of options. overall id say it was worth the wait, but next time dont make us pc gamers wait this long and release it alongside the console version.",43.7
"i played gta 5 for the first time on my ps4 and i was amazed at the quality of the graphics and the quality of the story after finally building my gaming pc and gta 5 finally being released on pc i thought that the graphics would just improve a little. but i was totally wrong after installing gta and running it for the first time i could definitely tell the increase in graphics. i would totally recommend you to go and get this game, if you have already played it either on a 360 or the current consoles i would totally recommend getting it again if your pc can handle it of course.",9.1
