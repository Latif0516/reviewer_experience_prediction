"im not having problems except low fps because of my end, so gg",0.4
"in the past ive had my share of day one problems. but this time everything went butter smooth. so not everyone is having problems :-) first few missions have been a blast (just phoned the ceo of lifeinvader :). the mission feel is close to gta iv, but everything upgraded. not only the graphics, but also the way the missions can be played / story-line, imho. so if youre not running into installation problems and you liked gta iv, its totally worth it. the extra time they took to optimize the game, was worth it in my case.",17.4
"very amazing game. dont believe some people when they say it is just another badly ported gta, sure it has a few problems still, but just be happy it runs better than gta iv, a game that came out 2008, and gta v looks just about as good as gta iv with a ton of mods. if you have the money, buy the game it is very worth it. these slight issues will most likely be patched within a few months time, probably not even that.",91.3
"you can get stoned on the couch and watch tv all in 4k resolution 420/420 would play again",38.8
"at the moment the console version is better there is alot of issues. i have never once played without some sort of issue. its either a graphic error, the game minimizing and not opening, randomely freezing but i can still hear sounds around me, or it wont even launch. 2 years and the only thing different is the number of players and the graphics its kinda dissapointing atm.",21.3
"this game is alot of fun, better optimized than many other games in a similar situation. i would not recomend it for anyone with higher than 1gb of vram due to the fact that you will likely have to play at 1440x900p. overall very fun and gta online is amazing.",22.2
"if someone gives a positive review, that probably means their game launched successfully. if someone gives a negative review, that probably means their game failed to launch. you can guess how my game did.",30.1
"freezes on launch. support ticket being ignored. brand freaking new 980 video card. thanks rockstar!",1.5
"had it for ps3 and ps4. honestly i want to upgrade my graphics card a bit to meet my wants but others wise its playing really well for what i have. games already a 10/10 but on pc 11/10",45.4
"while i was frustrated with rockstar at first for delaying this game for so long. everything was forgiven when i powered it up. it has been optimized extremely well for pc, even with my outdated gtx 660 i can run it on medium - high settings and it looks great! i havent had any crashes or annoying bugs (so far) , so all i can say is, well done rockstar.",15.6
"so far this game looks exquisite. its so exciting to have a game that i can push my pcs limits with in order to have such phenomenal visuals. gta v contains unlimited gameplay and potential gameplay to entertain you. if your pc meets or exceeds the requirements, i highly recommend you pick up this game. if you are looking for a reason to upgrade your rig? gta v wouldnt be a bad reason to do so as well.",24.7
"wow is this ever good. if you have the pc for this then get it. get out all your agression and be as stupid as you have always wanted to be. or you have been this stupid and now you can do it without going to jail. peace!",68.9
"this game is everything i expected it to be! fantastic story, gameplay, amazing multiplayer and much more! totally worth the 60$",16.4
"the game looks great, it feels great, the world is huge! but thats about it. there are very few side missions, the main missions are fun, but the map is so huge and there is so little to do that it leaves me empty. i dont recommend this to anyone, just about finished it at 40 hours, but i could have had it done earlier than that. you cant buy houses, there is pretty much no point in buying businesses at all. playing from australia, gta online sucks. i am always matched with people from the us and . so if im trying to shoot someone, or say, just drive around, half the time people are just clipping around me. oh i got this guy! no you dont, because he is a kilometre away now and youve just been shot in the head. sad, i had high hopes and gtaiv was great. heaps of missions and . in this you dont build anything with your characters. they dont actually go anywhere. they dont create empires or even take them down. sad. 5/10.",49.3
"my little brother and i share our libraries between accounts. unfortunately, you cannot share this game between accounts because r* sucks and you have to have a key code to start the game. its fun otherwise. i love motorcycles.",0.6
"amazing. just amazing. unfortunately my poor fx 6300 has mini strokes trying to play this game lol. looks like its time for an upgrade! 11/10",38.1
"fantastic. i owned the game on xbox one and 360 and i thought it would be a waste of money to get on pc. regardless, i pre-ordered it and took a risk. i would never turn back. i dont have the best pc, gtx 750ti, amd fx 6300 and 8gb ram and etc. it runs beautifully, i have it all set to high running a smooth 60 fps with textures set to normal. i set everything to very high and leave textures on normal and i get between 45 to 59 fps, never drops below. fantastic game. looks so amazing on pc and i would recommend to anyone. it was well worth the wait and the added pre-order money doesnt go unnoticed. only thing i dont like is how we use our social club names not steam, and i have my social club name as an old gamertag and i have to wait a year in between changes and it doesnt say how long i have left to wait. doesnt affect the game in any way whatsoever. fantastic.",15.1
"an real masterpiece, one of the best games ive ever played, worth every cent, and definitely the ultimate version of the game, highly optimized for pcs. worth the wait.",66.9
"played on my ps3 in 2013 - 10/10 played with better graphics on my pc in 2015 - 10/10",20.0
"now that rockstart has fixed the game, 10/10, third time i have paid for the game, and it is my one true love.",27.6
"the wait is over... gta v is the game ive been waiting for the most and is possibly the best game ive played in a long long long time few errors when alt+tab game crashes or wont load back up when alt+tab again random fps drops in certain areas this is probabbly my pc pros graphics are insane the gameplay is insane the story is insane everything is insane yes i have played this on diffrent consoles before pc these pc players aint loyal 69/69 would play fat women with rpg again.",30.9
"this is the second time im buying this game and i can defenitely tell the difference from the xbox 360 version. i had a smooth launch and so far had no problems with it. game looks beautiful and runs pretty smoothly on almost maxed out settings on my rig: i7 4770k gtx 780 16gb ram (no oc) im getting around 50-60 fps apart from areas with high foliage density where it drops to around 30-40.",35.6
"doesnt launch. just tries to load and then nothing... and with steam, no money back.",57.6
"ill swing by and sign the contracts, just ignore the bodies",53.3
"ghetto character + bandana = $50,000 64 impala = $125,000 mac10 = $75,000 feeling of doing driveby shootings on every player on the map = priceless. best thug trainer simulator - ign. quick shout-out to console for the beta testing!",89.1
"crashing at the same point in the story every time now. takes 10 minutes to reach that point even to test if it will crash again. it does....such a shame. makes it unplayable.",9.1
"dont buy this yet. not untill rockstar fixes a game that weve been waiting 2 years for. 3 days still unplayable.  off social club.",50.2
"for some reson i cant start up my gta v game can someone help me?",29.8
"pretty well optimized. even my potato computer with a deacent graphics card taped to the side of it can run it at a steady 60 fps",11.1
"the servers are not the best but still recommend it",11.8
"gta v is finally released on pc, with much improvement from the previous gta iv release. it runs smooth 40-60fps even on my old hd6850. the same reaction when max payne 3 was released, why is this running smoothly on my old graphic card? rockstar has done a really good job on this. but still, 4 months of delay is pretty painful to wait.",45.9
"very much recommended if you want a non-stop fun time for pc. after a year and a half of console privledge, it has come to the pc! if you dont know about this game by now, youve probably been living under a rock.",62.7
"realy nice game. the graphics are just beautifull. i think to play on high-end you need atleast 8gb ram, else you could play on 720p. the story mode is as fun as the online mode. there is just a lil problem, when the nat of your network is set to strict you may not be able to play online, but you can fix that in the router settings i guess. however i highly recommend this game cuz its so fun. so we will soon meet online then huh? ;3 -biscuit",46.3
">gets into the heist >need to steal hydra >steal it >turn on the radio >danger zone >destroy the jets and get to destination 11/10 enchanced gameplay",84.4
"its awesome game and addicting,the city looks more alive than ever befor",83.1
"took about 45 minutes to decrypt the game once the release time hit. and here we go again, another time devouring game. so far so good, no issues running the game and getting started. runs great on a 3770k with nvidia 770 gtx sli @ 2560 x 1440 with asus rog swift g-sync. not a fan of making a rockstar account and finding my name taken by someone years ago. this rockstar drm requirement is encumbersome and shouldnt be a requirement for steam version. pro-tip install this on a ssd, will make installation much faster and gameplay much better. will update when i experience and discover more, but so far lots of fun.",14.1
"rockstar did an amazing job with this port. while my single gtx 770 isnt running the game at full ultra, its pretty close to it. much closer than i expected, after gta iv and many of the overhyped games to come out recently. this game looks absolutely amazing. i havent played as much as i would like yet because of work, but i will be playing when i get off. gunplay is as good as ever, driving is smoother, switching characters (not that ive done it much yet) works exceptionally well, and its all bound together by one of the most beautifully rendered games ive ever seen, and certainly the best open world in terms of visuals. i havent played on console since ps2, so this is my first time playing this amazing title. if, like me, you are a true pc gamer, you will pick this game up. even if you are a cross-platform heathen using both consoles and pc, you should pick this up if you are interested in the in-game video creator. it seems like a great feature to play around with, though i will wait until ive beaten the campaign first.",52.5
"this game is amazing!!. a shame this game costs 40 squids. should be 20-25 for the delay. had issues running this on my pc kept crashing ect but i finally fixed it.",10.6
"this game is ing great! people scream at me for no reason...update: i found out people were screaming at me because my characters black 10/10.",47.0
"the game wont run for more than a minute without crashing. even with bottomed out specs and latest drivers. rediculous. i want my ing money back. overclocked q6600 2.8ghz radeon hd6950 4gb ram",8.3
"it worth every penny i spent. 1. i get a payday 2. i get a nfs 3. i get a stock market simulator 4. i get a tonyhawk game 5. i get a flight simulator 6. i get a best onrail shooting game 7. i get a free tennis game 8. too much more to explore not to forget it got another free gta online",28.0
"spent hours murdering an increasingly furious child online. there was a crack of thunder, a flash of lightning, the heavens opened and his bullet-riddled corpse was drenched by the fresh, cooling rain - a glorious hd rendering of his tears crossing from the real world into the game. 11/10 - would buy again just to relive that moment.",10.6
"smooth like silk.....all settings very high or ultra, even in advanced, running on an evga 780 classified! constant 40-50 fps.......anyone who thinks thats low because its not 60 fps has no concept of what these numbers actually mean! oh by the way, still rocking an i7-920 from 2009 clocked at 3.8ghz......still as powerfull if not more than most current cpus! most people with crash problems and poor game performance on cards like a gtx 970, is just that, their problem!!! learn your hw, and learn how it all works. dont take it out on the developer just because you run mcafee/norton along with itunes and skype and chrome and 300 other apps all at once, then try to load a game and it runs like . rockstar, amazing job! cant wait for red dead on pc!",42.8
"gta five is a game in which you can do things that mimic real life. for instance you can play tennis, or ride a bike, or drive a car. the game heavily encourages players to partake in a number of criminal activities, such as gang turf wars and robbing convenience stores. however i have found it personally rewarding making my money legally, like winning car and parachute races! no matter what kind of lifestyle you choose, gta five has got you covered. 10/10 avoid this game at all costs if you dont like wonderful things.",56.8
"this game though. i compared the graphics of xbox and pc it was amazing. the wait was worth it optimizing.. you did a great job rockstar im looking forward to gta vi hahaahaha :3",71.4
"great game, stunning visuals! downside, horrible studdering after 30 minutes of gameplay.",55.1
"so far this game is fantastic. the port from console to pc is working flawlessly. visual detail looks great on high settings, and i have no issues in rendering or visual appearance. this game is a bit of a resource hog, but that was expected from the start. overall 9.5/10",46.9
"great game, wish it would run a little better but gameplay is top-notch",27.8
"same issue as many other laptop gamers. unable to launch game unless i disable my nvidia 780m. i have been re-enabling the nvidia gpu immediately after the game launches but for some unknown reason the game still runs as if its not. so multiple issues: - unable to the lauch normally with a nvidia 780m - 780m gpu is not supported for gta 5, even if it says it is - even after the 780m is enabled after game launches, game still runs off of factory intel gpu i love gta 5 (played it on xbox 360 and xbox one) and would love to be able to enjoy the game on this pc, but alas, i cant. now the nvidia 780m that i have is pretty good (runs arma 3, total war: attila, battlefield 4 just fine) and should not be having issues with gta. the issues are with this launch. i mean come on, no support for portable gamers (laptops)? no support for certain nvidia gpus? buggy and unstable gameplay for those that can run gta? gta 5 has been out for 2 years... come on rockstar. get your $hit together. awaiting the much needed patch in order to play. kinda of wishing i didnt waste $60 bucks.",8.3
"finally got this game and i was not dissapointed!rockstar always takes open world sandbox games to the next level and i was just blown away by this game:)",30.4
"a game that will no doubt provide incredibly memorable experiences from trying for an hour to get a sailboat over a bridge with a cargo bob to get it out of a lake only to find theres a second bridge down the line, to going through hell to steal a motorcycle from the lost but then finding out you cant keep their version of that motorcylce, to spending hours driving back and forth to get a car you want to spawn then seeing it all the damn time after you finally have it. despite the uncountable moments of blind rage this game has given me, its truly an amazing game with something to offer for everyone, so get it dammit!",39.4
"finally! i dont have to go bowling with roman ever again!!!",21.5
"i have to addmit i was dissapointed with how badly this games launch went for me (not that i wasnt expected some sort of issue), my game wouldnt even launch. but once i found a fix and got round the issue and can realy recommend this game. it is a big step up from gta iv. the campaign is great and the multiplayer is even better. if you are having issues with this game stick them out, it will be worth it in the end.",76.6
"launcher problem - solved! i had problem with launcher (crash just after log in to social) ive just reinstal my win7 and left much more space for instalation (90gb before, 300 gb now)now game working perfectly! the problem was i think that before when i left 90 gb for instalation i just forget that gtav instal will weigh 60gb but complytly i did not think that game after downloads must unpack and instal and download another paches when ive seen few erroers and monits about no enough space on your disc so i think you have to leave minimum 130 gbor even more. after instalation game weigh 60 gb . enjoy !!! dla wszystkich ktrzy maj problem z launcherem ktry wywala do windy,zaraz po zalogowaniu do social club, crashowa itp, itd , mi pomoga reinstalacja systemu i ponowne zassanie gry z ta tylko rnica e zrobiem zamiast 90 gb wolnego miejsca na dysku a 300 bo podczas instalacji wyskakiway mi bedy o braku miejsca na dysku itd. gra teraz chodzi a mio. pzdr.",13.9
"best version of the game. amazingly well optimized",17.1
"3 days on the game and i already found 3 game breaking bugs, and i dont even finished the main campaign yet because the bugs force me to restarting my progress. get ur  together r*",28.3
"the game doesnt work, got the recommended system to play but doesnt work 10/10 would refund. dont buy you could be affected!",24.1
"this review might change later, but for the time being... i cant recommend this game. i bought it after debating for a bit, but decided to jump in and enjoy it. it crashed a few times and was offered the self-refund option. i tried it again and i was able to bind and play a bit of the game.... then it crashed again... i wish i had taken the inital self-refund. if you read this, my recommendation is to wait, i bought it to enjoy it, and now i just feel like im stuck with it as opposed to enjoy it.",28.9
"gta has finally came. not much more to say besides pressing the add to cart button.",45.8
"my pc can barely run this game with a gtx 460, 6gb ram and an 2.80ghz cpu. but its giving me more motivation to save up and upgrade my computer.",30.0
"so much better than console i mean its not withoutt its bugs but im having a blast online with my gaming community as well as single player in first person",88.2
"incredible.. really incredible. graphics are top notch. running over 120fps on ultra. rockstar never disappoints! this game is a must buy!",32.2
"9/10 lost cars when transferring character, rockstar has my ticket about it though.",51.0
"a shining example of what thorough development times and attention to detail can achieve. also a fantastic port with a ton of pc-specific options. i will gladly wait longer for a games release if it means that they will all be of the quality and standard of this game.",45.6
"11/10 still great game after 100 hours ps3. and i survived the waiting time ^^ everyone knows this game is great, i mustnt tell you why! :d",21.9
"elder scrolls online had a better launch. all my friends are fanboying over it though",52.9
"many  have social club issues but i dont give a sh*t , just suit myself , the game works great , 15/10 p/s: pls gabe , add gta v trading card , i want it really bad",46.9
"the best gta game and easily the best game ive ever played xd",46.1
"i became master of pc programming after grand theft auto v exited unexpectedly. 10/10",2.0
"what is not to like about gta? i have played this game on x360 and x1. story mode is fantastic. the elements of playing three different characters was a great idea. seeing the game evolve over the years of releases has been a blast. x1 version looks great but once you can great the game up to max and play it at 60fps it feels like an entirely different game. trying to go back and play it on console just doesnt satisfy anymore. frame rate is king to a degree. driving just feels incredible at 60fps. gta online is a blast to just drive around and mess with people. once you can get ranked up heists are fun but they do leave some things to be desired.",16.3
">played as michael >got run over by a car >driver was extremely sorry and asked me if i was okay >played as franklin >got run over by a car while riding a motorbike >driver just keeps on going while ignoring me >another car drives over my bike and hits me as well >driver basically says  happens and moves on >i get sent to hospital 11/10 would be targeted by racist drivers again (btw a really good pc version)",49.9
"i own this on ps3 / ps4 / pc. i think thatsays enough about how much i love this game...",20.1
"amazing! i have a amd fx-6300 oc@4.3ghz, 12gbs ram,gtx 650ti and i can run this game with some stuff on high and most on normal at over 100 fps sp and mp at 1360x768 i love this game",81.5
"wow, just... wow, i have played this so much on ps4 so i expected to be bored the first day this was realised, this pc version feels completly different compared to the consoles, it almost feels like a whole new gta game, the graphics are unreal and probably the best graphics i have ever seen in a video game, so easy to run on such high quality, by far the best game av played in years... 10/10 by far. the long painfull wait was woth it!",56.4
"this is the best game ever!!! i can drive a real airplane now!! 100% graphics 100% fun 100% strategy 100% happiness 100% all 100/100",85.6
"in simple way, bad reviews are only from peepz who can play only solitaire on windows. i have never problem with this game from when we can start it. good optimized for old pcs like my. serious review comming later. watch less porn and ur pc will be ok.",22.3
"i had this game on the ps3 and ps4. i have to say i thought the ps4 was a huge change from the ps3 version. now i have the pc version and it looks absolutly beautiful. i really recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the gta series.",7.3
"amazing! few minor issues at start but now all is good! getting between 60 and 120fps constantly all on very high.",47.5
"the game is fun enough, the story is funny and you always have something to do. online is kinda lame since youd normally go from single player with all the items to online with nothing, and if you dont have a group it seems like a gank fest for the most part which can be fun if youre into that kind of thing. my only real complaint about the game is the horrible controls. with a gamepad its not to bad but mouse / keyboard it is so awkward and clunky. for example you go through the game using wasd for movement and then suddenly go into a plane and it wants you to use your num pad, wasd, and then youre expect to look around with your mouse. they could have done a lot better with just using your mouse to steer the plane and wasd to control pwr and left and right (forgeting the name). the game is fun and once you get over the controls is very good. id highly suggest atlest having a gamepad of some sort atlest plugged in for those flight missions since its very easy to switch between the two.",7.6
"gta online, hop in online, see quite a number of low level peps, says hi, dey be rude, trys to kill me with pistol, shoots back, says i rude 2 dem, wtf logic?!?!?!",34.8
"loads of crashing whenever playing online, like loads of other players. guess the delays were for nothing.",59.0
"better than the majority of game launches these days, 10/10",64.1
"its great, idk what else to say its gta 5 on pc...",46.5
"what the... you still do not have this game yet? what a pity!",35.6
"once you go fps , there is no turning back. i had this for my ps3 , i will sell it so i have this here now. the games is still incredible but after rockstars new stuff , its a total killer. would buy it 10 more times in 10 different times.",9.5
"i still have yet to get a response from rockstar and its nearing its 19 hour mark and my game will start but then crash after the police sirens go off. i cant even get to the rockstar logo. terrible support and this is after a few weeks have gone by that they coudve fixed these issues",3.3
"everything seems to work fine. even my old gt240 managed to work well enough. i never asked for this, but even the worst possible graphics look insanely beautiful.",56.1
"the worst part about this game is that i cannot play hoxton breakout.",30.0
"i would make a good review, but im not going to, since rockstar who has used so ing long porting this game and it still s up massively on launch, like holy ! ive been waiting since 2013 to play this ing game and now i have to sit on my  and cry for an entire week while the fedora wearing scrublords fix their ing game, 10/10 pepe approves.",28.9
"game is not working. support doesnt respond. i could get refund only in 7 days. excellent.",9.7
"outstanding, had a bit of a problem when trying to create a social club account, the pesky steam box with code was in the way of the link account ok box. amazing graphics so detailed at 4k, great story and so much fun, have not tried online mode yet but should be good.",6.1
"plays well, runs well, is fun! online connectivity is heaps better than the ps3 version.",17.4
"well i downloaded the game three times on two computers and nothing works, none of my steam games will open and im done with steam and gta 5 im about to ask for my money back both computers running windows 7 64-bit",63.6
"i paid $60 for this game. pros: everything you could ever want out of a gta game. ... and then some. cons: 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",10.5
"day one surround/eyefinity support no crashes no glitches graphics settings both good looking and optimized controls ready to play this truly feels like a pc game. 10/10, would wait for delayed relase again.",69.2
"slept only 5 hours(taking naps in between) after its release, its mind blowing. for a game that was released in 2013, it doesnt feel like its old. the real mvp? my girlfriend. even tho she despises gaming, but for this she let me play for extended hours ^_^",81.0
"knife in real life = $10 ; knife in cs:go = $400... 9 / 10 players ready, favourite game.",14.8
"from what i experienced in the short time i was actually able to get this game to run(probably around a half hour total), i would rate this game 9/10. unfortunately this launch was a huge disappointment as 95% of the time the game refuses to even run, and the few times it did, crashes resulted randomly or even as a result of clicking on a different window and then clicking back on the game screen. i have opened a ticket with rockstar support and tried all of the fixes they and other people have recommended but nothing has worked. funny how they delayed the release again and again to ensure that the game is as polished as possible, and to make certain that both heists and the gta online experience are ready to roll out on day one for pc. well guess what rockstar? the game doesnt even run for a lot of us. im sure eventually this problem will be fixed on your end and then ill be able to forgive you but until then, i just want to warn anyone whos thinking about spending their hard earned money on this game that there is a significant chance the game wont even run, and so i would recommend waiting until rockstar has fixed this issue.",1.8
"doesnt even work are the 60$ worth enough? rockstar doesnt seem interested on fixing the error",1.1
"just as stephen colbert won television, rockstar has won video games. this was called the everything simulator, and thats not inaccurate. attention to detail, solid mechanics, a great storyline, online gameplay even i enjoy, variety of cars/weapons/clothes/buildings/people/everything else: one of the best games ever made.",21.4
"this is my first time ever reviewing a game. ive come from console gaming to pc, which ive had this game on ps3. i can only say its way much better i dont have super highend graphics like most people do on here but im playing on high settings with 30 fps which is pretty good considering im not too worried about having mind blowing performance.",53.5
"unplayable. crashes with bluescreen all the time. 60 on .",14.6
"tons of fun. its everything from console gta v and more! controls are great, its almost impossible to tell its a port. the game also look amazing with tons of graphical settings. driving into certain areas does make the game lag quite a bit, but this is probably something to do with my computer. other than that though this game is amazing.",19.2
"havent managed to launch it without crashing, but im sure its fun!",8.1
"excellent graphics, attention to small details, awesome gameplay, all running optimized as smooth as butter! was worried about gta 4 killing off this great series, but gta v is here now to seriously revive it. still needs a rockstar social account to signup and play, but apart from that slight setup annoyance, well worth it.",4.3
"fails to start if you are using a laptop, however, for now you can disable your video card start the game then re enable it and it will work fine. game looks amazing and first person adds a whole new level to driving around like a mad man. i have owned gtav for 360 and xbox one, both had a lot of problems at launch and was pretty much un playable for the first few weeks. pc had a bit of a rough launch because a good few people cant play, however, i have never once been disconnected from a game, or had problems joining friends. once you have it running everything is near perfect. i would also note though, that if you turn your graphics up real high and your pc cant handle it you will see a lot of input lag making it really really hard to drive. if your having troubble try lowering some settings.",16.7
"first of all , this game is absolutley amazing . but, there are a few bugs ive found already (i have no clue if its only for me or for everyone) 1. no silencers show when the guns are used in a vehicle and neither is the sound effect correct (both in single player and in multiplayer) 2. in single player , once i boot the game up as michael and i spawn in a restaurant with his wife , the table they sit at seems to spawn twice , one being static and the other dynamic , and the tables start flipping out and flying all around the place - i actually got killed by this bug once ,being clobbered with one of those tables. i also have note about the aircraft controls , numpad 5 being the  pull nose up button got me killed a couple of times , ramming into buildings mashing the numpad 2 key thinking it should lift me up , i suggest it should be switched to numpad 2 like most games have ( yes i changed it in the key bindings menu , still ) .",41.8
"overused vram by 600mb still runs like beast. i would say that the optimization is worth the delay 10/10",21.8

"you dont need mine or anyone elses opinion on why this is the best game that ever was, instead ill use this space to give you guys some troubleshooting info: game wont start (win 7) - make sure you have service pack 1 installed (win 7) this fixes most social club issues. - make sure you have the latest drivers. - .net framework 4.5 is required - disable antivirus and firewall for installation low fps with good hardware - turn of high res shadows - take postfx down a notch - use fxaa only for very high end systems (980, 780ti, 970, 290x etc) - watch the memory meter for vram, when setting up game, and add about 20-25% to get a real number of vram usage. - push settings up, one thing ive noticed is game runs much better when pushing the hardware. happy gaming",39.7

"the multiplayer matchmaking is absolute garbage. be prepared to spend 80% of your time in this game either loading, finding a free roam session with people actually in it, and looking for players for your game lobby. the best part is when someone disconnects from your heist and you have to start the process all over again... what the . it can take up to 20 minutes to start a mission that only takes 5 minutes to complete. pros: + fun when it works, that 20% of the time + looks good, runs very well cons: - random disconnects from free roam modes, putting you in your own session alone - takes absolutely ing forever to find people to play with - if someone disconnects from your heist, you must start the process all over - loading screens can sometimes take up to 4 minutes (on an ssd!!) the hardest part about this game is not being able to play.",30.2

"im 5 hours in and loving it. rockstar have done an incredible job at optimizing performance, it runs much better than gta4 did on the same pc. if youve played any other gta, you know what youre getting. difference being this time the city is even larger, the graphics are even better, and the swearing is even more frequent.",15.1

"moving on from the console versions of gta v, even after months of delaying and waiting, this game proves to still amaze all gamers. obviously, the graphics is the biggest upgrade, but the delation for the release of the game turned out well for its great optimization to the pc port. its amazing how relatable gameplay is with consoles just by using a controller. feels like theres no difference except (better) performance, graphics, and details in the game (like its music). i already owned a 360, ps4, and xbox one version of gta v, but it was well worth $60 to buy the pc version. you get what you paid for, and even more. this pc port is what every game developer should aim for. how optimized it is at launch compared to other games that releases a dead-bugged game that makes it almost impossible to play. its safe to say that all gta players will be missing out on a new experience if they dont purchase this game. 10/10",33.4

"ah, a, dont hate me cause im beautiful, a. maybe if you got rid of that old yee-yee  haircut you got youd get some es on your . i would say that this is the game of the century, so much activities, missions, way to entertain yourself, so great script, lamar is killing it with his quotes. and then comes the gta online, which is even better! you just gotta love this game, it was worth the extra time and the multiple release dates. love it! goty/gotd/gotc easily.",24.9
"really cool game, with a eye for the details. you can get lost in this world for a very long time just walking around looking at the life around in the map. it has a bit of everything for everyone,. the singleplayer is really well done and the multiplayer is also pretty cool. though the multiplayer can be a bit hard to get started in. all in all it is a pretty cool game for its price, can seem a bit expensive, but it was well worth the money for me. i did own the game on ps3, and i must say, the high fps/more graphical options on the pc version does make the experience a lot more enjoyable. the first-person adds a different and very interesting way to play the game. gameplaywise the game doesnt add anything drasticly new from the newer console versions, there might be some stuff i havent discovered yet though.",86.2
"very well optimized, even for old toaster setups. 1680x1050 with a gtx 660ti and a i7 920 cpu at the stock 2.6ghz has no issues maintaining 50-60fps in every area ive been to so far, most settings medium to high. there was some pretty glaring stutter at the auto graphics settings, but reducing soft shadow quality fixed it. population density is still nearly maxed out, and the world feels alive because of it. rockstar was wise to take their time with the pc release, they definitely didnt want a rehash of the gta 4 release fiasco. so if your specs are greater than mine listed above, you should have no issues running the game at high settings. its just as fun as it was the day i brought it home on the 360 - only this time its even better.",90.4

"this was the game. the one we have all been waiting for, after all its delays and and buildup. we did not recieve what we were promised with this game. it doesnt have any improved mechanics, and is almost unplayable. i meet all system requirements, and in the first mission with franklin; where you drive with lamar, the game crashes after many choppy and annoying lag spikes. the game also takes up to 5 minutes just to load the title screen, then 3 more minutes to load up the game itself. this is super disappointing, because i couldnt sleep i was so excited for this game. i am sure this will all be patched in the future, and same with the broken download thing. but at the state this game is in, i would not recommend you buy this.",15.7
"im sure everyone knows what gta is, so i will skip right to it. the pc version is extreme well optimized. i have been running it with barely over minimum system requirements, and although the graphics are pretty limited with my crap computer, the game still runs smooth. i may update this after i install my new gpu. i love the self radio station, where it allows you to import your own music playlists into the game and listen to them either as a regular playlist, or as an actual radio station with dj commentary in between songs. the rockstar editor tool is also amazing, allowing you to film your gameplay and edit yourr clips into a movie for uploading on youtube, and you can upload your clips directly from the in-game menu. you can seemlessly switch between using your game pad, and your keyboard/mouse, without needing to change any settings. this helps with navigating menus and editing your rockstar editor clips. i cant say much about the graphics, for reasons i have already stated, but im told its amazing with a proper gpu. bottom line, this game is well worth your money, even if you already own it on a console.",39.6
"bought the game, downloaded the game, launched the installer, waited for 30 minutes including watching the resource monitor, nothing happened, 59,99 eur for 3 hrs of my time to waste. you decide if your time is worth the money or not, this is not an actual game - only a corrupt installer.",33.2

"been playing gta 5/online from the xbox 360 to xbone and now pc, with my gtx 970, its great with very high settings and can transfer your character to the pc even tho you transfer from last to next gen. better controllers with the mouse and keyboard and 60 fps without any lay, i do recommend this game. just make sure your pc can handle it, would check on can you run it and make sure your drivers are up to date.",21.2
"man plz go buy this game and play it u dont need any reviews its gta v <3",76.7
"amazing game improvements (this is coming from an owner of the ps4 and ps3 versions of gtav - yes, both). the only cons are: - no hotas support (i really want to be able to map my flight controls for air combat). - long loading times in multiplayer (always the case with gta online though) - a few minor server instance bugs (really difficult with 2 friends on same server getting into the same missions) - cant transfer singleplayer saves to pc, even if you download from ps4 and dump them into the savegame folder. oh well. the biggest improvement is the insane framerate. im only running a several-year-old gtx 680 nvidia card and ive maxed out all settings and post-processing effects (except textures due to mem limits) and it runs at 60fps easy. smoother than any game ive ever played. period. i also will comment how great it is to play first-person with a mouse and keyboard on gta for the first time.",15.2

(i already can see the stunt/drift/real life server!!!!) +gta video editor. bad: -fov very low, like a user mod from other gta. -you have to play 3 characters and not only 1. -you cant get big biceps or be fat. -only 1 big city and desert not like in sa.. where is my las vegas?! i want to lose some money.... -still no casinos. -too much rain!!. -cant buy much in sp.",62.0

"thank you rockstar for not bull shiiting us. this makes us pc gamers really happy and crave even more for it. it is greatly appreciated. in the end, not every company are butt holes towards their customers. as they had said, the game is optimized for pc and it doesnt even require a high end pc to play it. i am very happy with my pre order purchase. :) p.s fu ck those rushing games or just delaying them to give us a version that still is crappy!!!",45.2

"oh my days. switching from first person to third person is epic. the graphics are immense and smooth too. well done rockstar north, well done! no wonder you kept putting it back to make it perfect as it actually is! the shooting in first person is as good as any fps out there! im babbling on but its 2:30 am on release date with work in 5 hours but i cant help it im blown away, seriously blown away!",11.6
"wait to get it. game controls are messy and even with my geforce gtx 970 the game still lags graphically. crashed twice on the repo michaels sons car mission. let the creators fix alot of the bugs first before you get it, otherwise the game is no different than consoles",24.4
"honestly, it was worth the wait. thank you rockstar for making one of the best pc ports of existence. the rain runs well at a full 60 fps most of time in very high settings. however, unpacking simulator isnt a far off synonym to this title. the game is well polished and the online servers are actually a lot better compared to the consoles. i guess this time we should thank the devs. if all else fail, vinhll fix it.",49.9
"pc specs: 8gb ddr3 ram geforce gtx 770 amd a10-7850k (4c/8g) and i still have issues with this game. the map doesnt load as its supposed to do. i have set my graphics down as far as possible, even though i can play this at almost max, and the map still wont load when i drive a fast car. i dont know why this is happening, but its really annoying. heres my idea for a fix: make the game load the whole map before you get into the main game. or at least add a settings that allows you. those 10 extra minutes i can wait if my game doesnt just randomly stop responding and i have to wait like 3min just to take a single step so the map can load.",16.7
"- fov is too narrow, the slider does nothing. - vehicles do not even have an fov setting. - vehicle damage has so heavily been dumbed down form the ps3 version, they dont even crumple in any more in the slightest. just disappointed, got my refund, rockstar need to fix these things.",8.1
"extremely entertaining, excellent graphics complemented by a seamless user experience. overall a fantastic game that can be played on both laptops and desktops. with all settings on high and getting 60+ fps, its a major update from the ps4 version. my verdict is simple : it was worth the wait, the long wait. p.s. well done rockstar on this spectacular user experience and graphics you have managed to pull off!",25.0
"despite the plenty negative reviews on gta v, i honestly think that those who did post a negative review were just dissappointed that they werent able to play as soon as it was released. sure there were some problems that many people encountered, but with a game this big, problems are bound to come and go. i havent encountered too many problems and so far the game is beautiful. ive played on the ps3 and the pc version is so much more detailed and thoughtful. there are things that boggle me still to this day. best game to play with friends, and overall you dont need to think twice on buying this game, the problems will ultimately be fixed as rockstar do not want their reputation and expectations to drop.",42.2

"aside from the 10 hour 60gb download, the game is giving alot of people problems and rockstar is sitting on their asses counting money. i have put in a support ticket and followed up 6 times and no one has responded. the online freezes and crashes, a problem that many other people are having. on others forum posts, rockstar also has failed to reply. it seems as though they have absolutely no clue as to what is causing this problem prohibiting online and story play. totally unacceptable for it to be out this long and no patch for an issue making the game unplayable for some customers.",54.5
"very overrated. takes too long to have any fun online, and when you get to it enemies can take too many hits and players take too little. near constant sound of sirens. the quickest ive ever been bored in an open world game.",18.0
"its gta v. need i say more? ps. it ruins social live :(",68.2
"this game is so much better than what i was expecting. the online portion was already working a few hours after the release, its greatly optimized, and the control scheme is wonderful. the driving and flying is seemless as long as you know all the controls first. this is definetly the ultimate edition of grand theft auto 5 and i dont think ill stop playing it any time soon.",53.2
"it does have the same good features of the console version but youd need a very solid pc to run it efficiently. i particularly had problems with playing gta online. shame really as thats what i was looking forward to. my pc was made with gaming in mind but it struggles with this game. only purchase if you have the hardware to go for it. the recommended specifications are where your pc specs should be minimally. you have been warned!",1.1
"im going to give this game a negative review for now and may change it later. the online is a complete mess and needs to be completely redone. rockstar needs to go back to the mess of max paine 3 and really figure out what needs to be done to correct gta 5 online. with lag a core issue which leads to teleporting players, vehicles, 90 degree turns that should not happen, and miss leading damage to other players when pvping. the load times to are terrible especially when trying to get into online with friends. the lobby play is nice but when the matches are done you should not be thrown out of a session if your playing with only friends and have to constantly have to resend invites. flying the planes/helicopters to me need to be tweeked alittle because they are alittle clunky. ive seen to many times heists bug out at certain parts and becoming stuck in a loading screen. the only thing im going to give positive for the game is the single player. the graphix are flawless with a amazing storyline. i could spend alot of hours playing only single player because of the replayability. like i said i may give the game a positive review but once more patches come out the game should hopefully be amazing.",59.6
"really impressed, flawless graphics and optimization!",25.3
"there is a big issue with laptops! there is a big workaround to make it work where you have to turn off the onboard card, launch, and quickly turn on the video card. not recommended until they fix this. edit: seems to have been fixed in the last patch. game is amazing, you have probably read all about the expansiveness and freedom of options. runs beautifully on my laptop.

"pc master race strikes again. 11/10 would sell all consoles immediately",22.7
"after about 3 hours of playing i can definitely recommend this game to anyone. it has been a long wait but this game is worth the money. one of the best additions to the pc version is the director mode and the 60fps boost. director mode will be a unique tool to use once everyone gets the hang of it but it is still really cool. playing with a mouse and keyboard seems a little awkward at first but you can get used to it. i personally feel like after playing this game that this game was made for pc as it is extremely superior to every other version. so finally i give a rating of 8/8 buy dis game yo.",47.7

"for the most part, this game is great. its everything a pc gamer wants from a game. great storyline, fantastic graphics, 60 fps, you name it. but there is one thing that is so serverly aggravating that it is preventing me from giving this a good review. its the fact that every single time i try to join gta online, it forces me to sign into to social club. dosent sound bad, right? well, the issue is, every single time i try to log in nothing happens. absolutly nothing. in fact, when i sign in, it actually logs me out of the game, forcing me to restart my game. i cannot join online because when i sign in it sits on the sign in screen and does, as i mentioned before, absolutly nothing. it dosent look like its trying to sign in, it dosent look like its trying to do anything at all. so now my friend and i cannot play online together, which is a huge shame considering how everything else about this port is amazing. its almost as if i can only play 50% of the game, because gta online is such a huge part of the game. hopefully, rockstar games will fix this issue. if that is to happen, i will change my review for sure.",21.7

"certainly gta, despite being an extremely late release, the improvements to this game are pretty strong! pros: the fps feature makes a great improvement in playability and experience, for it may help players who are used to fp shooters not feel completely alienated being forced into 3rd person, and driving any vehicle from the inside delivers a nice touch of depth (working odometers in a non racing game.... wow). further more, the story for this game was great! this is to gta v as a whole (meaning pc/console); anyone who hasnt played through it already, anticipate a solid story if you plan on picking this game up. single player content is loaded. cons: more of a personal gripe, ive found myself switching between my xbox controller and mouse/keys due to control-complexity. xbox controller for anything involving a vehicle, and m/keys for in combat (whether in car on the move, or on foot). theres a lot to remember for different key functions.",43.7

"same as xbox 360 just with better fps all in all still a great game",28.1
"its gta. you cant really ask for more than that!!",26.7
"tried all fixes; the game does not start. hardware is over the recommended specifications. the most expensive desktop icon ive ever bought, but at least it comes with a free 61gb of useless data, just in case youre not enticed by the desktop icon alone. edit: completely uninstalling firewall fixed the issue. changed the recommendation to yes, even though this fix shouldnt be necessary to play the game. game itself is 10/10",69.4
"did the prologue three times! but it was pretty so its ok! tl:dr this game is a lot of fun. now for online with all me buddies! heh heh",22.9
"omfg! my highest scoring game of all time 98/100 im fortunate to be experiencing this maxed out in 4k res. it is by far, the best graphics i have ever seen in any game in my life! it doesnt end there. the gameplay is equally amazing too - it really is a stunning piece of work in every aspect! the bad points... sometimes after getting killed during a heist, or pvp i dont respawn correctly. it stays stuck on a splash screen. if i try moving i can see myself moving on the mini map.. to be fair, this has only been out a couple of days on the pc.. i am aware of some people having a lot of problems with the game though - although its not clear if their problems are with their system or the game. highly recommended from me - especially if youve got a high end 4k gaming system",64.4
"do i recommend this game? hell yes? your pc is ? well then spend about 1050$ getting a new one. dont have the money? then you might have problems! all and all gta 5 is an amazing game and to be honest it may start bumpy. glitches, ect. but in my game, i havent had a crash, once, ever on this game, but a few, as in one, frame drop. my pc is built for this, however, as in the begining, dont got the cash then dont buy it, enjoy others and dont write a bad review blaming the game rather than your   300$ walmart piece of",57.3
"this game sucks............. u gotta be kidding me. :d",24.9
"glorious. glorious indeed. well worth the wait. runs liks a dream on my very modest (though conservatively over-clocked) i72700k / gtx580 / 8gb, so if you had any doubts as to whether this would run or not on your own non-gaming pc, even modest rigs do the trick, and it really does look increadible. an amazingly immersive experience that lives up to the hype.",8.9
"great game, works nicely on a decent pc very fun to play co-op missions the graphics are amazing.",6.6
"i bought the game on xbox 360 when it first came out, and i have no problem paying a second time, for this pc version. 10/10 would pay again.",28.0
"loaded up the game onto multiplayer, loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded, found a lobby with friends, drove around with them doing all the shenanigans most players get up to on gta, then everyone left the lobby. i was then disconnected and sent to single player where i got to then listen to michaels persaonl life problems. pause. go to gta online, loading, loading, loading. rince repeat. i think the game will be fun once rockstar fixes these server issues a select number of us have to endure. but till then i wouldnt recommend the game for multiplayer.",41.5
"with all the disappointing and and  triple a games lately i was worried when i pre ordered gta v but i dont regret it now. the shaders are great, the textures are nice and the game play is great. the driving is a bit hard to get use to but everything else is great. the characters are interesting and i am actually excited to finish the main story of this game which hasnt happened since sleeping dogs. the game runs great and i could easily max it out and run it stably in full glorious 1080p @ 60fps and the best part is that i will never have to go bowling with nico again.",12.0
"this game is a very solid pc port. it runs fantastically, the graphics options are lush and plentiful, and i especially like the way that you can seamlessly switch between keyboard/mouse and gamepad (you can even use both simultaneously). gameplay wise-- its the best gta yet. be it doing crazy  online with friends, to the amazing singleplayer campaign, youll certainly put in hours upon hours of gameplay in. definitely recommend to any/all friends.",31.2
"game is very will otimpisted, i am capable on running on nearily full ultra/very high settings with some shadow settings disabled with 30ish fps. but that resulted in wierd shadow texture bugs. my biggest issue as of now is the drawing distance, texture pop in is nearily the same as the xbox 360 or even worse in cases and it looks nothing like the trailers.",15.2
"im just at beginning of the game and this is some kind of a first impression comment, but still: its crazy good! worth the wait for pc too, engine is so smooth and realistic. if you like these kind of games, youll have to own it proudly.",24.5
"no imponte dukes on pc, next gen exclusive cars 0/10  game",53.8
"the pc port for gta iv was a disaster, so im glad that they didnt  this release up! works perfectly with everything maxed out and youll stay above 60fps 99% of the time, atleast with a gtx 980 4gb card! if youre not mentaly handicaped or have parents from hell, then i see no reason for why you havent gotten this yet... (hell, you should have gotten it back in 2013, !) game looks amazing, but the sound effects for the guns are terrible, unfortunatly...",40.5
"the best game on the best platform insures and secures gta vs crown to be the best entertainment software ever for the next decade. key pros: graphics settings (lots of options) realistic scale story on pc would recommend to aliens xd",24.8
"his game would be amazing, if only rock star would actually figure out how to get their premire day to function properly.",10.0
"goto the strip club with friends without the smells and glitter. 11/10",50.0
"amazing story mode, with an envolving story and memorable characters, along with fluid gameplay, being one of the best single player modes ive ever played. about gta online, it is definitely the best multiplayer out there if you are looking for some fun time white friends.",67.5
"after watching the positive pc port report video totalbiscuit made i figured gta v would be a great pick up, but unfortunately i ran into so many issues rightaway that i ended up requesting a refund which was still an option due to the other problems the game had. issues i had: - jerky/laggy mouse movement in the menu. changing vsync or mouse input didnt help. - settings didnt save after quitting the game and restarting - display calibration screen on every start - benchmark crashed to desktop after a 3 minute black screen - fps tied to sensitivity (not this crap again, sigh) i run a i7-4790k, 16 gb, r9 290x machine and from what i could see from my short experience, the actual framerate ingame is fine so performance seems ok otherwise. this is the first refund ive ever requested and im glad it was still an option. fully priced games, in this case even more, should always have an option for refunds to avoid these sorts of things. one thing steam could learn from origin. i hope they patch the game and fix all these issues because i am certain the underlying game is brilliant, but i just cant support it while theres so many problems before even getting to the actual playing part.",0.8
"essentially improves everything gta iv failed at with much more content and updated: graphics, gameplay mechanics and a huge story.",18.7
"this is a game. you install it and play it and enjoy the ride.",3.5
"much better than the console version, it even better with friends online. all of playing hours.",50.8
"great game and graphic than gta iv.. but i have a problem, cant even launch gta v with my windows 8.1, installed it not on the same system hd.. after i reinstall windows 7 ultimate on my new harddrive, it works like a charm, please fix this annoying bug.. but yeah like the previous version, gta is always fun to played..",11.2
"i cannot even play it because im stuck at rockstar games social club loading... tried to update drivers and all, verified game, but still it doesnt work.",17.9
"i dont get all these negative reviews mabey they havent optiomised the game yet in their settings because the game runs smooth az no problems 10/10 would pre purchase again",61.4
"just excellent! i didnt suppose that this game will run on my pc, because it is a normal thing nowadays when minimum requirements for the game are just meaningless - there is a very little chance that it will at least launch. however, i was very impressed when i saw a nice optimization - stable 30-50 fps in fact, that every spec of my pc is just as the same as the minimum requirement (i5-2320 3.0 ghz, gtx 550ti, 4 gb ram). the game itself is the best thing ever done for the whole gaming industry - not more not less. rockstar did its job well. 10/10.",39.9
"i highly recommend this game, in spite of some non positive aspects, such as the price in russian region. it is ridiculously expensive game. but as the positive sides, i want to point to: - high optimization - pushing the limits graphics and physics - next generation sandbox environment - advanced ai - well enough online mode - over 1kkk hours of fun and madness - i killed a cat while running from the cops also, this game helps to release stress very well :)",7.5
"very good job done , runs really nice and looks great",24.8
"managed to get married and divorced during decoding. 11/10 would preload again!",31.7
"i actually wrote this review 2 years ago, but after multiple delays i have been able to release it. 10/10 would wait another 2 years again",35.2

"spent my pre-order bonus on cars. game glitched lost cars. mother er. 10/10 would buy again.",28.2
"after a long wait and many delays, grand theft auto v has finally arrived onto steam. its a great game that you can mess around on, wreak havoc, break laws, obey laws, buy stuff, shoot stuff, blow stuff up, drive stuff, fly stuff, play with friends, and many, many, many more features. the graphics are amazing, and i especially like the motion blur added to the pc version. those with low fps (20 - 30) will be glad that motion blur is a thing. the gameplay is fantastic. i cant recommend another game as good as this one. the controls feel right, the movement feels right, everything feels right. the texturing is very detailed and so are the many small things in this game. not a single thing is left unpolished in all of san andreas. why are you still reading this review? go buy the game already. its worth the $60.",46.2
