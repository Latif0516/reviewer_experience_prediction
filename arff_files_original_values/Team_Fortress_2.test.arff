"this is not a game. this is a life style. 11*c out of 10",2267.4
"the best free to play fps out there. the only problems i have with it are a few issues with registering backstabs, hits, etc, which only really happens when youre lagging like crazy or the guy youre trying to kill is lagging like crazy. can be annoying when you clearly backstab someone but they only take the damage of a normal slash and easily turn around and kill you instantly.",642.4
"this is currently and always will be my favourite steam game! over the hundreds of hours i have spent playing this game i seem to never get bored of it unlike other players. the objective of this first person shooter is to collect expensive hats and unusuals (this should always be a priority),collaborate and work as a team (unless in a pub server full of newbies),choose from 9 different classes who each have a unique ability (example:scout can double jump,cap points 2x faster and is currently the fastest class avalible) to play to keep it fresh while playing,pick from a variety of game modes to spice things up when bored of constantly playing payload,crush the opposing teams spirits and accomplsih the given task. this is an amazing first person shooter and is super addictive.i rate teamfortress 2 10/10",1881.4

"as one of my most played games of all time, team fortress 2 is an incredidibly original and fun fps. it not traditional, in a way. but i can honestly say no other game has come as close as being as fun as tf2. i mean, you know when a game is good when it has its own economy. anyway, play tf2. its free, its fun, and it doesnt pull too much out of your pockets like other free to play games.",442.1

"im not normally a fan of fpss, but team fortress 2 is different from the other fpss out there. if you expect your standard warfare game fps, then youll be disapointed in this game. however, if you are looking for something a little bit different, then perhaps you should give tf2 a go.",399.6

"yes yes and more yes this game will be the first game you get",2344.5
"as a cod, i was really blown out of the water by how much i enjoy this game. no class feels overpowered or useless, which really adds variety to the gameplay. even more variety can be found in the different weapons you can unlock for each class. the addition of hats and cosmetic items really has given the game a sense of fun and chaos you dont find in the more generic fps games. (any game where i can hit someone to death with a fish is a plus in my book.)",537.8
"probably the funnest game i ever played, fun graphics, fun gameplay, and full of hats :d! whats not to like?",674.2
"team fortress 2 is a breath of fresh air i never thought could be found in the fps genre recently. the game centers around 9 classes, the medic, the demoman, the heavy etc... which all have unique abilities and items to set them apart. the gameplay is perfectly balanced and extremely fun. this game adds so much to such a malnurished genre i cant even put it into words. there are several gamemodes (including co-op) and different play styles its impossible to get bored with this awesome game. in all honesty there is no reason for you not to be playing this right considering you own steam and its free to play, its that good. tf2 gets a 10/10.",458.1

"all i can say about is game is that it is pure and utter brillance about from the fact you are considertered awful unless you have single hat you called terrible and i find that annoying but i love the different weapons rangeing from a sapper that talks when you dont want it to to a flame thrower that shoots rainbows.",1037.5

"this game is beyond fun. as of now, i have already spent 24 hours playing this awesome game. it cannot get any better than this. call of duty can go cry in a corner.",42.6
"this face paced fps game is one of the best fps games out there that ive played, and as a person who isnt generally into the genre itself, its saying a lot. i spend most of my time here and its worth every second, as replayability is high and entertainment value is too. plus, its free.",896.2
"we need more........more...................more........more -----> hats =))",343.1
"this game is great! the only thing that bugs me is that a lvl 0. hat that is for 5$... its pretty good, just price adjustments would be awesome... now i dont know a lot about this game so dont judge me- 9.3/10 great game!",8.7

"what can i say, its a fun game. if your a fan of fps or like games where you can make your character look fabulous, then this is a game for you. ive seen people who have thousands of hours invested into this game and probably just as much money. even if youve played all the maps, beat every mvm, and completed every achievement, youve still only played half the game. yes, tf2 is an fps on the surface but, its more than that. its a game that has a bustling trading market of weapons, games, apparell, and items for other games (ive seen pokemon deals on some trade servers). all in all, its a pretty fun game.",616.4

"team fortress 2 (tf2) is the sequel to the game that put class-based, multiplayer team warfare on the map. tf2 delivers new gametypes, a signature art style powered by valves next generation animation technology, persistent player statistics, and more. unlike other class-based games that offer a variety of combat classes only, team fortress 2 packs a wild variety of classes which provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities, and lend themselves to a variety of player skills. play as the flame-throwing pyro, the room clearing heavy, or the spy, a master of disguises. other classes include: scout, sniper, medic, engineer, demoman, or soldier. tf2 features the most advanced graphics of any source-based game released to date  and the most exciting class-based action ever created.

(2fort) (i started playing when it was quake team fortress back in 99). i enjoy being able to customize my character now with cosmetics because it gives a sense of uniqueness to your character. i enjoy going demoman and decapitating a plethora of players. if you enjoy non-sense, funny dialogue from characters, non-stop mayhem, a very well-balanced game for the most part, doing conga lines, etc. this is the game for you.",2773.1

"team fortress 2 is a class-based mmo + fps war-themed hat simulator for the pc and mac. originally it was a faithful recreation of the original quake and half-life mods, but has since evolved from its original design into a pointless virtual collect-a-thon where the player must collect every rare item they can by any means necessary, in order to inflate their ego and show off their e-peen. the original point of the game revolved around playing game modes such as capturing the enemy intelligence, pushing a bomb to the enemy base, or controlling a whole map by scout-rushing control points, but now all this is nothing more than a small mini-game to pass the time with while you wait for more weapons and rare items to magically drop into your inventory while doing  all on achievement, trade, idle or non-serious, fun-oriented servers. tl ; dr edition - collecting virtual hats makes you cool, and makes everybody jealous of you.",501.7

"despite the fps genre being smashed into the ground with crappy games as of late and is way overdone, team fortress 2 provides a refreshing and action-packed experience for an otherwise overdone genre. there are gamemodes you cant find in any other fps, the large variety of classes keeps the game interesting and suits any play style, the action is intense and addictive, the nonstandard weapons are fun to use and have their own unique twists (i, for one, like the soda popper: it allows you to jump insanely high after charging up at the cost of a much smaller clip size), and this game is 100% free! you can still pay money to get certain things if you want them, but it is completely optional, which i applaud. if your computer can run this game, what are you waiting for? team fortress 2 gets a +9 on the scale of -10 to +10.",78.2

"this was one of my favourite games for a very long time (as you can see) the gameplay is very solid and alot of fun with friends or even on your own. the downside for me was the introduction of the free 2 play and annoying weapons that rewarded gameplay as simple as airblasting somebody into the air and then shooting them with a speical shotgun to do mini-critical damage. weapon combos like this ruined the game for me because soon enough everybody starts to do it and the varitity starts to fade away. 7/10 good fun, but after a long while you may be grumpy like me.",2233.4

"this may very well be one of the best games i have ever played, this fun action mann packed multiplayer adventure is a blast from the second start up the menu! using a cartoonish styling makes for colorful unique maps and matches. one of the best parts about this game (other than hats) may be the nine very unique quirky classes who fight over well...gravel. even though it is a free to play game and you can certainly have fun staying free to play, f2p i do recommend that you buy an item from the in game mann co store, only buy a single item and you will be upgraded to a premium account, you will find better items, be able to trade as well as many other features. there is so much more to tell about this game but i alone cannot say it all, you must play this game to trully understand it, if you need tips or help i can and will try my best! have fun and remember.... if you find a gibus...just..just keep it off ok? 9.5/10",1080.5

"team fortress 2- absolutely no words can express what i feel about this game. main reason is i have mixed feelings about this game. its a great first person shooter game, with many servers allowing you to customize your character. the downside to this game is the creators will to continuosly aim the game towards a money-making process. so much of this game is money-oriented, its quite sad and ruins the cartoonish aspect the game provides. but besides that, this is one great game that would not disappoint. through the hours i have logged, i have spent countless hours playing competitively, casually, and even just sitting there and helping coach other players. its a fun game, and i really do love the time playing it. the cartoonish feeling and effect has a major voice in my opinion. reason being is just that after coming home from a long day of work, the cartoonish characters, with all their personalities, is a real pleasure to see. would recommend you get it.

"the quintessential fps for furries, pre-teen angsters, degenerates, and finally, frustrated old ers like myself that love making all of the above cry by the mere act of fragging them in an fps while shouting abuse on the mic. recommended but only because theres no point to not recommend it as everyone and their dog is playing it as we speak. p.s.: grow some balls, valve. swearing on the internet is as common as drinking water.",2640.0
"fps shooter games have been spread out around the world becoming popular, but when it comes to tf2 its like no other. its simply made and easy to play just like the way its made, its different every day with new things to do with new updates, including taunts, cosmetics, and loads more, building up the game. what makes tf2 a unique game apart from cod and bf is that its not as big as those games, well ofcourse it has loads of stuff, but not as sophisticated as the other fps shooters. it does not have singleplayer, not that (extreme) graphics and including other more features that other games have and not tf2. but not having features like cod or bf makes it better and unique not worse and more repetitive, therefore when cod or bf players try tf2 for the first time they dont really understand the concept of the game, which explains the game is unique. overall tf2 is an addictive and unique game with lots to discover, hoping the game gets better. 10/10",695.5

"the most perfect hat simulator in the world. but lets get serius, this fps is one of the most humorous games i ever played, and if you want, you can play the game absolutely serius and competitive, wihout any need to pay anything, totally free. you just have to buy an item on the store (less than 1 euro) and you will have the premium account permanently, a bigger inventory and a few more things. its just your choice, nobody forces you. the only problem of the game its that it has a absolutely broken economy, due to the re-sellable items through the steam market... so, if you want to have some fun with one of those chaotic unrealistic (better than cod, of course) fps, this is your game.",1037.8

"basically a good first-time-game, if you want to play shooting games. graphics are unique when you compare it to other pvp games. a big shop with a lot of clothing and free weapons makes the game more interesting, in a way that the users can get creative and style their own characters. nine classes, makes the game more challenging and less boring, as you can just switch class when you feel like it. the videos about the characters and their histories are absolutely terrific and the medic is something you dont see in every game, as you heal with a medic-gun and shoots with this incredible syringe shooting gun, where in other games its often a character with a medic-back and often with normal (often normal) guns or in use of some type of magic. also is the game always active with players and new products in store. in all is the game catchy and available for everyone.",736.9

"free im just joking, but seriously. if you really want to enjoy this game on the fullest you have to buy ingame items to actually get into this game. overall the gameplay is great, also the characters have their own story to tell. if there is a character that you like to play, then team fortress is just the game for you! hop in and choose a character of your liking, sadly as i said in the previous lines.. the cosmetic items are sometimes really expensive, so loosen up your wallet a bit! good points: -dynamic gameplay -easy going and fast learning -fun with friends -a wild variation of weapons to choose of! meh points: -not as free as they telling you -a very annoying kick-system -alot of trade requests",157.2
"this game kicks  in more ways then 7. what more can i say, after all, 7 different kinds of  kicking is enough to buy the game- but wait, its free!! team fortress 2 is one of the most played games on steam and its not a surprise. its a fps with a cartoon-like twist! the more and more you play it the more and more you unlock new things. after a while you just get so caught up into it and boom. no life :3. but in all seriousness, i highly reccomend this game for its extreme balance between players. it doesnt matter if youre a f2p or a p2p, the weapons are always equal. the cosmetics however... different story. all in all, 10/10 stop reading this and go get team fortress 2! see you online :l",336.2

"things i like about tf2 - first off, the gameplay is amazing as there are 9 different classes with really different play styles, in tf2, its not like cod where most people just go yolo rambo around. tf2 is a game that requires teamwork, (thats why they put in a medic class) things i dislike about tf2 - first off, just because the guy who keeps headshoting you wears a gibus does not mean he is hacking. i have come to a point where i really dislike f2p accused of hacks just because they are f2p. sure some of them do but dont always accuse unless you have proof. and so what if you have alot of good items and cosmetics? that does not make you a good player.",699.3

"quickly and frankly. the game is great fun. you can be laughing some times. the graphics is simple, but still nice. it has its own unique character, which you can hardly find anywhere else. the game is not really serious, so the game is especially for casual gamers. there is a marketplace, where you can buy and sell items for real money, however even though its f2p you dont really have to spend money into this game. great funny game.",175.4

"its hard to become bored with this game. between the updates, new items, and community based around it, id give tf2 an overwhelmingly positive rating. its competitive, but with a light twist. the personalities of each class definitely contribute to the love as well. it sucks you in, so much so that you begin alienating friends, family, pets, and before you know it youve logged over a thousand hours and youre living behind starbucks in a cardboard box, subsisting on coffee and wifi like a leech. but in your heart you know that it was all worth it, and that everyone and everything not related to tf2 is a distraction keeping you from playing tf2",1096.5

"a fantastic team based shooter with vibrant classes that all stick out. the mechanics are great and the fact that you need to rely on your teammates to win the game instead of just going crazy with your smg gives the game an interesting twist compared to other fps games. the game feels fair to me with items recently being tweaked in every update to make the game more fun for everyone. every class has their strengths and weaknesses and it makes you learn placement and timing for you to get revenge on that soldier who killed you last life. i genuinely enjoy team fortress 2 and its one of the best made games that ive ever played. hopefully youll be able to enjoy tf2 like i do. edit: eotl killed tf2",2114.3

"this game is extremely fun and highly addictive. the only downside is that the players who bought the game before it was free are really butthurt. if you are a free-to-play player, it is likely that the paid players will be on your  and treat you like youre the new kid in class. my advice: ignore them. theyre just silly people who are butthurt that they had to spend money and you didnt. arguements are easy to get into in this game, so youre best option is to just play the game and avoid all communications unless someone seems really nice. :3 gameplay wise, you can never go wrong in this game (unless dealing with hackers). the game is incredibly balanced so that even if youre a new player using default weapons, you can still land yourself on the top of the scoreboard. just dont get cocky. people dont like that. have fun, be nice, and you may be rewarded with some sweet gear. 9/10 it was okay",356.2

"let me just say that the mechanics here in team fortress 2 is amazing. you do eventually start to feel tempted to pay money for items, but considering the fact that all items in tf2 are balanced, its not pay 2 win. camping is hard to do due to the fact that no class really has a machine gun or a weapon capable of killing an enemy in a single hit. spies can pick off campers. my only minor complaint, which is more of a compliment, is the fact that no class matches those in games like cod or bf, making it harder for players of either series to get adapted soon. and of course, vice versa. bye.",880.2

"if free to play scares you away from this titile: dont let it. it is a great game! there is no need to pay anything, as all items are given though drops, the more you play, the more stuff you get, premium player or not. speaking of premium player. you become one by spending any amount of money in the game, even under $1, and you will always be a premium player, no subscriptions. this basically lets you have more items, and sometimes get hats and rare (but only cosmetic) items through the drops. players are not hindered by being free to play, or by not playing a lot. the default guns given are balanced, and unlocked guns provide benefits in some areas, but have negatives in others (ex. a larger clip, but no random critical hits). all in all, the only thing that will make you like or hate the game is the gameplay, not the pricetag. if you like fps games, you will love it, if not, still give it a try, you could have fun, and not need to worry about being locked behind a paywal.",1132.9

"ah, finally! the sequel to the worlds greatest lego-based shooter! now you may have heard many people call this a hat simulator, or a world of warcraft expansion and you would be right in thinking that these people are complete idiots. this game is a third person shooter. rather than adopting a lego approach, valve decided itd be better to make a game that looks like some kind of kiddie crap for casual gamers. of course there is blood, but its cartoony, and will most certainly harm your reputation if you are caught playing a game for three-year-olds. the game offers two teams: usa or russia. the russian team has a huge advantage by getting all the publicity and easy modes of play, so of course you know that they need help in winning against the worlds greatest country (usa! usa!). if you can see past the childish community and graphics, i actually recommend that you buy this game, but only so you can watch a violent cartoon for big kids.",1839.7
"team fortress 2 has been one of my finest gaming experiences ever. ive played many multiplayer games over the years and i must say tf2 has proven to be one of the most innovative and constantly changing (for the better) title ive ever dealt with. though ill keep this short i will comment that every class feels unique and every character organic; with a playstyle and personality that each can call their own. this is perhaps my main drawing point to the series as their are few thinks more fun then dominating your enemies while your demoman slurs drunkenly about the battlefield with a sword and decapitates a heavy with a minigun. in all my time playing this game the experience has never diminished and i hold high hopes for the future of this game,",2530.3
"what can i say i collect hats for a living! oh and occasionally play payload",1307.7
"after spending a large amount of time (at least, compared to the amount of time ive had steam) ive spent on this game, i have to say that this game is one of the better games on here. sure, there is the occasional idiot on a random server, but for the most part, the community is very nice (when they arent blowing you up with rockets or gibbing you with a minigun). anyways, this game is a good one, and, even if you dont spend money on it, youll still have an amazing time on it.",1140.8
"this game is truly one of the funniest and funnest games ive ever played! i highly recommend this game for anyone looking to dominate a server in bloody glory or to casually turn demomen into hamburger. no matter your skill level, tf2 is for you.",772.1
"balance? check. teamwork? check. nonsense that has nothing to do with the game? hell yeah. trust me. after 1000+ hours of playing this game i probably will never stop. atleast until ing keys stop acting like gas prices in the us. but seriously i love this game. one of my favorites. only way it could get better is if you could customize your experience. oh wait....",1895.6

"i really enjoyed playing this game, but theres a... disadvantage. team fortress 2 is like, a friend of yours from elementary school. you really like to be with him and love to hang out with him. but the you go to high school and you lose him. then you understand how stupid that friend of yours was and dont want to hang out with him anymore. but, suddenly, your friend has magically found your phone number, and calls you all the time to go out and have some fun. and of course, you have to go, since you cant just say no! he starts calling you every day. you lose all your precious time for studying to go out with him. you start regreting that you were friends with him. but then, you realise, you are actually having fun with this guy. you regret accepting to befriend him, but then you just do it again.",929.3
"a great game that you become addicted to the minute you play it. just dont fall into the temptation to buy hats or weapons, because once you start you cannot stop, it is like a drug. but other than the incredible amount of things you can buy it is a great free to play game.",17.1

"i started playing this game in the spring of... what, 2007? thats the year after it came out, right? the grand old days. i remember when spies couldnt take teleporters because the glow would persist even when you were cloaked or disguised, and the only way to refill the invisibility watch was to stand in a corner and hope desperately that nobody was going to turn around. i remember when pyros had no airblast and engies couldnt move their buildings or upgrade anything but sentries to level 3. ahh, yes, that was a simpler time. a time before demoknights and mini-sentries. a time before crates and item drops. a time, by gum, before hats. a time when spies had their mouths crammed full of cigarettes, when wielding the ubersaw was a mark of excellence, when spytech provided equipment instead of mann co and nobody had heard of australium. those were the good old days, the golden years of tf2... you know what? the games improved a lot since then. go play it. i still do.",1708.7
"i had watched videos of this game, and i couldnt wait for that one day i could play it. when i was finally able to play it, i didnt regret a thing. this is a fps you simply cannot compare to any other fps out there. each class has its important role to the team and not one bored me. however, the game can be challenging at times which can sometimes lower the excitement i feel when playing normally. even with the few problems it may have, it is still an amazing game, which i would recommend to any gamer who likes action and humour.",883.6
"one of my absolute favorite games ever. very polished team-based shooter with fun objectives.",0.6
"team fortress 2 is awesome. cod lovers, stay away. this game is one of the most balanced games in terms of weapons/classes etc etc. this game is recommended for anyone, really. very funny too, such as heavy kissing his minigun, scout giving people pop quizzes, and pyros simple mmph. my only trouble with this game is that it needs less hats, and more weapons. hats are cool, no doubt, but seriously, hats dont have to take over a single update. its pretty weak in gun selection imo, but its pretty balanced, as said before. whatever gun you prefer, just use it. this game is the greatest fps i have ever played. do not avoid this game. .:9/10:. +awesome fps -lack of weapons & maps, too many hats +humorous dialogue +insanely balanced",570.3

"valves team fortress 2 is quite different from most multiplayer games that come out these days. first of all, the balance of this game is excellent. seriously. out of all the classes, the only one which comes even close to being overpowered and unbalanced is the pyro, which is terrible at long range, so probably that evens out. secondly, the humour and the classes are enough to keep anybody entertained. there are 9 classes in the game, and each one has their own unique personality and traits. i definitely recommend this game. if you havent played it yet, do so right now. its free to play, but i had bought it when orange box came out.",74.8

"this used to be such a great game. then it turned into a hat simulator with people spending more time on (getting/building) hats than on actual teamplay. and believe me, this used to be one hell of a first person tactical multiplayer shooter. back when it was still in beta form and shortly after that this used to be the only game i played. the cartoony graphics still look brilliant, and the gameplay is magnificent as well. i only wish they would remove the hats (wishful thinking, i know). the gameplay relies to heavily on teambased gameplay, which is a good thing, believe me, but not when a lot of people are scattered all over the place. you really have to work as a team at times. still, for a (now) free game its pretty much the best thing you can get out there. in the end i would still highly recommend it.

"i got tf2 last year some time and have been playing ever since. you may not think 100 hours is much but it is seen as tho i play so much minecraft. anyway, i would reccomend tf2 to anyone because it is a really fun free to play game. i found the tutorials on how to play very easy to understand, the tutorials consist of being a certain character and going through what weapons they have and what they do. once gone through the tutorial i went on to mulitiplayer, the multiplayer of tf2 is faultless with countless amount of servers to choose from all having different aims like capture the point or team death match etc. you may be thinking to get better weapons you will have to buy them in the store like in other games, well thats not the case as you find items while playing, which you can use or trade with others. making it ideal for all gamers no matter there budget. graphics side tf2 has decent graphics with a low to zero lag experience. if you like third person shooters tf2 is for you! 10/10!",335.8

"after all these years, tf2 is still one of the most balanced and dynamic shooter games out there. the art style is a refreshing break from the usual quasi-realistic-grim-tactical asthtic of most other popular shooter games. the action is fast paced, there are always new stratagies to try, and this game is great with friends. whats not to love?",351.9
