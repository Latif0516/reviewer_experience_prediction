"great game for spending time online but not recommended for slower pcs, gameplay is fine but will take a long time to boot up",11.8
"hats, hats. unusual hats, strange hats and more hats 11/10 would hat again",952.6
"the most fun you can have online. true to the last word. add to this the fact that tf2 is free - it makes for a great deal! :d i bought the game along with the orange box via retail, so i have a premium account; and boy, is it worth it. though there isnt a lot of difference in free and premium, you should buy it (i recommend the orange box - it costs like usd15 when bought via retail in india, and just usd15 for 5 games is awesome!). the multiplayer game modes including king of the hill, payload, control points, are all great. the team behind this game releases new game modes as free updates at times (the halloween game mode) - these extra game modes are epic! you arent even restricted to one set of weapons, you can keep collecting weapons via random drops or craft them; almost every weapon in the game is obtainable in this way, excluding limited edition ones, etc. the new co-op mode (mann vs machine) has added a whole new dimension to the gameplay. thumbs up!",195.9
"hands down one of the best games i have ever played. there is so much to do whether it being slaughtering the enemy to a pulp in payload or just chilling back on a trade server there is something for everyone.",1975.3
"team fortress 2 is probably the best free 2 play multiplayer game available, hell, probably one of the best multiplayer games available period. the game under no circumstance requires you to buy anything with money, and you can easily aquire every weaponm in the game without it. every item is very well balanced, and all feel genuinly unique, and the characters in the game are hilarious. vale has continued to provide constant support and free updates since 2007, and show no sign of slowing down. if you have not played team fortress 2 yet, what are you doing? you owe it to yourself to at least try it once, and if it is not your type of game, no harm, no fou, its completely free.",1276.9

"this game is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",232.8
"this game is by far one of the most greatest f2p games i have ever played. the game itself is free to play, however you will see youself having so much fun that you will probably buy atleast one thing in the store to get premium which alows you to trade (which is a big part fo the game) and it also gives you extra backpack slots which will be needed later on. the best thing is some items in the store are only 25 cents so its very cheap to aquire premium. with occuring updates to fix the bugs and add new weapons, and great balancing out of the classes, tf2 deserves a 10/10",446.8
"i like trains, and payload brought my two favorite things together. hats, explosions, and trains!",213.7
"entertaining, and quite the adventure. the community is usually decent and the graphics are what they are supposed to be, and quite nice. the game is very much based on useless items such as hats, but the customization is definantly the best ive ever seen in any game before. 9.7/10",658.2

"i like this game because its on many different systems. my dad plays this on the xbox 360, and i play this on a mac. i do recommend this a lot because it shows great defense and attack forces with 3 different types of weapons with about hundreds of weapons.",47.7
"ign asks, what it is spam, youve played this game for over one-thousand hours, whats the dealio , tell us what antics youve been up to over in dustbowl and 2fort? well i says, ive been too heavily immersed in tf2s cocaine graphics and aesthetics, sophisticated hat geometry technology and of course i absolutely must give credit to valves implemented economy that is so stable that even greece and spain cant handle the amount of jelly. also, i almost forgot to mention the corrupt  who came up with the idea of a spreadsheet, i would be honoured to  in their toilets for their ingenuity in creating something many people strictly ing follow and dont want to deviate from because they think its the new testament. 10/10  ign, because we give honest reviews.",1103.0

"this f2p does fill up to my expectations and is surprisingly outstanding for just what you can do without paying. i have taken a break from tf2 as it was getting addiciting. i did come back and is still fun in my personal opinion. the content is fresh, as it is being updated once in a while with new weapons. the gameplay is nice and smooth, as there is no one particular class that is the most powerful, similar to a rock paper scissors style. the avaliabilty of the items are great too as you can find any item without paying. i could write an essay explaining to you everything about tf2. in fact, i have! (this is off-topic) anyway moving on, still an amazing game, balanced gameplay, tons of unlocks, many gamemodes to play. overall, its an excellent f2p fps.",1206.4

"if you have steam, there is no reason for you to not have tf2.",1155.8
"this is a very nice fps with uniqe clasees and weapons.",141.8
"the best thing about this game is that there is no noticeable difference between those who pay for in game items against those who dont, because the default weapons are some of the best you can have. the game is very fun, and the variety of classes, maps, gamemodes, and servers make this an epic fps experience. if you are a hardcore cod or battlefield player (like me) then you may have trouble getting used to it, but the game is great after you get used to it.",822.9
"tf2 is the best free to play game on the steam market! i suggest you all buy it! what are you waiting for????? buy the game already!",1173.6

"team fortress 2 is a good game ! pro: tf2 is a good game because it has a good item system which allows you to get every wep. when i started playing tf2 i suprised about the graphic because it was comic. it looks great! the game has a lot of items and different item qualities which i think are great. i have never seen a game with so that many items and that many hats. cons: the game has some bugs and some server owners and admins which shouldnt be admins and server owners. all in all this game is awesome ! thx for reading.",931.4
"overall, great game. as a free game, this tf2 is noob friendly. it is fast paced, and fun!",363.4
"my money... where has is all gone!?!?!? if you got friends or want to make friends, this is the game for you. best game for playing with friends or finding people who could be your friend. lovely game, there is pretty much only. this game needs alot of strategy and it is really fast paste with scouts jumping/running everywhere, demomen flying across the map, and soldiers jumping from wall to wall. the best part are the hats but you will find out why people love hats later.. tip: do not buy from the mann co. store, instead, go to a website called backpack.tf",1385.3
"you like fashion? you like owning things youll never get to own? like seeing people get scammed out of 50 bucks? well youve come to the right game! welcome to hat simu- i mean teams defense fort 2 (2) where you go from lenny faces to furries just by hopping servers!",912.3
"8/8, you can whack people to death with a ing mackerel, enough said.",1468.2
"one of the greatest free-to-play games out there, this is, while not super competitive (or, if im totally honest, even sometimes fair), what it definitely is is incredibly fun and addictive. innotive in almost every way, and having creative and interesting classes and weapons- along with the fact that the game actually feels free-to-play and the only real advantage of the micro-transactions is saving some time- i definitely recommend this game to everyone willing to put the time into it.",120.0

"ruined my life. but at least i have some hats. 5/5",579.4
"super cool game, all the classes are fun to play and the different game modes provide different experiences, depending on what you like. its nice hoe theres a plot to the game (in a way), once you see the comics. some fun things such as pyroland, funny taunts, etc. really make the game a lot funner.",37.8

"i thank the based god everyday for team fortress 2.",140.0
"incredily addictive. this game is one of the most fun first person shooters out there for two resons: balance and ingenuity. this game is very balanced. while it may be free to play, there is no dominant weapons. there arent even upgrades really. there are just sidegrades. if you want something, you have to give something. at the end of the day, it all comes down to skill. this game is also remarkably inventive. you can try out every weapon, every map, and it will never feel like the same thing twice. plus, this game has a great sense of humor.",632.9
"wonderful simulation of the hat trading black market",260.5
"this game too me is a really fun game not just because i like shooters but because this game has a sorta type of goofiyness too it and i my opinion it make it more special than other more serious shooters.",99.0
"10/10 ign this game rules and everyone who plays it does aswell unless you are a free to play",500.2
"this is probably the best multiplayer game i have ever played.",849.1
"a very addicting, unique,sequel to the original. easily one of the best games that i have ever played.",417.4
"i refused to play this game just like i refused to read harry potter. in both instances, i was apologetically wrong. (and twilight...but dont tell anyone that)",76.2
"interesting game play, nice, 9 classes, i give out 9.8/10.. xd, one of the best f2p game!",10.7
"what can i say? its great entertainment, even though tainted by the trading stuff and the destruction of the aesthetics, its still a great game",5.3
"this game is an amusing free-to-play game that is very easy to play, with minimal effort. it is very unique in the sense that there are certain roles that every class has, not just shewt da bad guyz i recommend this game to everyone who plays class based first person shooters, or likes valve games. if you like any of valves other games, youll love this!",629.9
"i dunno... its in tf2 must i really say anything else?",133.4
"crafted the milkman hat, took at least 1/2 of my items and 30+ steps. totally worth it i r8 420/69 m8",295.5
"this game is a lot of fun and is really enjoyable. each class has their ins and and outs witch combine for really fun gameplay. i would reccomend this game because its easy to learn and play, but has the ability to keep you playing even after youve more than got a handle on it. one more thing: hats",1321.2
"could have spent $2,000 dollers on games,charity, or something usfull. i buy hatz.... then i conga simulator comes out. tf2 is ruined (tf2 is evolving into conga simulator! tf2 has evolved) gaben stole my money ;-; 19/10 gaben took my money again",799.7
"a truly recommended game from my side, if you like a simple fps with many play modes, then this is the game for you. really fun to play with friends, but still fun alone aswell. the community is great, everyone is nice and ive met a lot of new friends by playing it :3 so, what are you waiting for? download tf2!",961.7
"after 383.1 hours of actual gameplay, i can officially say that tf2 is one of the best games ever made -you only need to play for 1 hour to realise that... so much variety is in this game in terms of playstyle, game modes and funnies that your experience is only tempered by your imagination. ive abstained and returned so many times and it still holds appeal: something that other games have never achieved. its a good laugh with friends or solo but dont take it too seriously. tf2 is far from a serious game and should be played with a grain of salt. for those of you looking for a challenge, youll find it if you look for it. if you believe the notion that this game takes little skill to master due to the presence of laser and rockets, you couldnt be more mistaken. its free as well; dont knock it till youve tried it. 10/10 would hat again",780.7
"good game cartoony graphics very fluid gameplay i reccommend this game",293.3
"cant stop playing it because this game is awesome!!!!!!",1613.3
"free im just joking, but seriously. if you really want to enjoy this game on the fullest you have to buy ingame items to actually get into this game. overall the gameplay is great, also the characters have their own story to tell. if there is a character that you like to play, then team fortress is just the game for you! hop in and choose a character of your liking, sadly as i said in the previous lines.. the cosmetic items are sometimes really expensive, so loosen up your wallet a bit! good points: -dynamic gameplay -easy going and fast learning -fun with friends -a wild variation of weapons to choose of! meh points: -not as free as they telling you -a very annoying kick-system -alot of trade requests",157.2
"my favorite kanye is kanye west because he can kanye jump from one kanye to another kanye. he also uses the (in my opinion) the best secondary kanye: the kanye. kanye west has proven to be the most kanyeest kanye you can ever kanye because his cosmetics are so kanye. i personally use the best in the kanye west and the west kanye in my kanye slot. overall kanye west has given me much kanye in kanye fortress 2. kanye/kanye would kanye again.",778.6
"good game, but gets kind of repetitive without micro transactions.",92.2
"with over 700+ hours on this game i think i have the right to say its one of the greatest games ever.",1052.5
"i highly recommend this game, its worth your time and very addicting!",538.0

"my favorite game! such well planned characteristics and weapons for classes.",1077.1

"team fortress 2 is a great game to play. you can do mann vs machine with you and other people vs the machine forms of yourself. or there is mann vs mann where you can be on the red or blue team. each character has a specialty. for instance, the heavy has his machinegun that can tear enemies into shreds. the scout can pack a punch with that shotgun and bat. the sniper, with far distance, smg, and a cleaver, hes a great class for you if youre into aiming. the soldier can boost himself up with an rpg. engineers can make turrets to help your team. and the spy can turn into enemies, backstab (1 shot), and can disable turrets.",14.3

"a fun game, with its own style of art, team forress 2 has a unique kind of style into it. i really seem to like the backgrounds, and always wonder what year this game takes place in (hopefully the 1960- 1980(i dislike future games)). this game solely relies on teamwork and interaction with teammates in order to conquer. ps",1600.3
"this game is actually fun like l4d2 and other games. there are 9 classes to play as, some maybe difficult and some could be pretty easy ex: easy:scout difficult: soldier. this game can be scary sometimes in my opinion xd not because of the servers. because of when someone pops up and i someone could scream xd. its pretty much very active,fun, and sometimes taking it seriously. but there is a workshop for valve to add miscs,weapons and stuff. :3",560.3
"ive spent over 2,000 hours (give or take with idle) and i must say it is single handedly the best game for a free to play to pick up. it has 9 diverse classes and an easy to pickup combat system, aswell as that tons of different game modes for players to use. as well as being so diverse, the game has endless fun and humour aswell as a insanely high skill level that i would say would be almost impossible to master. whether its a scouts hit-scanning ability or a soldiers ability to airshot fluently or just an engineers sentry placement the hours you invent so master these skills leaves anyone on their toes and wanting to play more. i definetely rate this game a 10/10 and recommend it to anyone.",2188.8

"welcome to team fortress 2. after 9 years of development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait.",410.3
"used to be a very good class based shooter. now its just a cosmetic item showcase (especially hats). in my opinion they added too much variation on gear. imagine if dota started as it is now, but then added interchangable skills for each character. would make it way more complex, yes, but would make balance even harder to achieve. now imagine if not everyone had access to those skills on release of this hypothetical update, but instead had to either trade for them, earn them through random drops, or straight-up buy them from valve. thats what happened to tf2.",137.8

"i have about 100 games in my steam library. almost all of them are incredibly unique experiences that i spent lots of money on. i never played any games in my steam library yet, nor have i even started these games. this is all thanks to tf2. this is one of the most fun games to ever exist and it has the best multiplayer around. there are thousands of players always online along with tousands of custom made maps. when playing free-to-plays the big question about it is is it pay to win?. team fortress 2 is not. almost all of mircrotransactions are spent on cosmetic things like hats! i dont understand why you are even reading a review right now when you can get one of the best multiplayer games ever for free. i would have spent 150$ if this game was retai. great community, great price, great online. no wonder this game has been around for about 10 years!",75.5
