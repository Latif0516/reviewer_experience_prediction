"i aboly love this game, it has great sound tracks and game play.",191.5
"i like this game because its free xd and also because its a rpg kindof based game and i love those kindof games",55.1
"great game but a little advice play mvm with friends you know",72.0
"its a first person shooter, and seems famous with all the players roaming around. sometimes the community is good, and i like how this allows voice chat, even though i dont use it, and sometimes kids are annoying. practically, i like it because it has 9 classes. overall the 9 classes, some have a certain job and place to be. for example, spy would hide in enemy lines while sniper would hide behind team lines. i like how the gameplay is somewhat balanced, like how heavy has alot of health, but is slow and sometimes an easy target for spies, whil being a bullet magnet, and medic can heal from a distance. but i like the different gameplay as there are slender servers out there, and theyre fun to play. overall, i like it because it has 9 classes which are somewhat balanced, an fps, and social gameplay.",1541.4
"trust me, you cant resist it! its the best game i have ever played. i really like because of its colorful style, funny voices and classes and the beautiful hats! i play it literally everyday but it is so worth it! i really recommend you playing this game if you like colorful and funny games like this! ill sure give it 10/10!",312.7

"if you have not played team fortress 2, then you should sit in a corner and think about your life! team fortress 2 might just be my favorite first person shooter games. you can choose from 9 classes, each one that has tons and tons of weapons and hats. if you think that it is boring just killing the other team over and over all the time, then you are wrong! be warned that if you get this game, you will be sucked into it and you will not stop playing it! you will spend your days locked in a dark room with a bowl of doritos by your side. you will become fat and lazy with no wife, no kids, and most importantly no life. trust me, it has happened to me already. remember that this game appears to be free except for one thing.... your life.",489.2
"it claims to be the most fun to be found on the internet, and frankly, id have trouble contesting that. its a brilliant game, a very fun fps with a nice art style that avoids the gritty immersion of games like cod and battlefield in favour of a more light-hearted approach to combat. the classes balance out nicely, the game has developed its own economy...and you have more than 300 hats to collect. did i mention the hats? tf2 may be the only shooting game based on hats. you could say that...theyre to die for! ... ill see myself out.",333.7

"even though it has glitches.. its still a very fun game with different gamemodes too. like prop hunt saxton hale, and a lot more. you can even have custom maps or make a private server so you and your friends can only play on it. tf2 will never die..",610.7
"there is life before team fortress 2, and there is life after. after is better ;)",680.6
"i love shootin people.. and when i die, i would get excited if there would be drops or not. 10/10 would die again",187.6

"great game, free to play, overall great community. and hats.",2681.3
"do you like spending over 100 dollars on a virtual ring you cant even wear? or 10,000 dollars on a stupid hat with a newspaper in it that was lit on fire? or 3,500 dollars on a dead person inside of a coffin that you used to get out of a small, 4x4 compact crate that comes with a skull from five nights at freddys following you around? or 2,000 dollars for a haircut that makes you look like a crazy, sadistic punk rocker that recently came from chernobyl? or 5,500 dollars for the fire hazard named the sorting hat from harry potter with a demonic face that got lit on fire? or 928 dollars for a gigantic, burning fish that does nothing but leech off of your brain tissue while you mindlessly slaughter others? or 200 dollars for a satanic christmas tree that you can wear? or maybe even the grandest deal of them all, a frying pan or a wrench painted in pure gold in exchange for your house, your car, and your virginity? this is for you! i still reccomend buying spinach with the money instead.",716.1

"this game is so good, i have much life now that i sit on my  all day playing it. why cant every game just be tf2, ewan is the worse tf2 player and should probably kill himself. one day i hope to cover the world in tf2 so every one can experience how good this game is",3.3
"this is one of best free-to-play games i have ever seen. i recomend tring it.",360.1
"this mostly f2p game is one of the best experiences from valve out there. full of references, jokes, sanviches, and of course, hats. there are so many different things you can do. feeling a bit bored of playing against players? try mvm and fight some robots! want an interesting challenge? try the halloween bosses. they offer an interesting take on koth and cp maps, as well as the scream fortress 2014 doomsday map. if you like trading, there are so many trading servers. overall, a 4/5 experience. id rate it a perfect 5 but there are so many things that can get overall annoying at times. mainly, mvm tour players and their requirements. a great (mainly) f2p game with an awesome community.",603.0
"this game is more of a collect and fighting gameyou kill the blue or red team get what you need and on a rare chance you can get a hat its not much to me buti like it good animtions bunch of awesome models its free but ill give it a like it still awesome",1173.3

"it ruined my life and i have no money now. but i have hats. lots of hats 10/10 -.-",1454.4
"this happened to be my first and still favorite steam game. you can find some real nice and fun people and friends to play with. the selections of weapons, hats, cosmetics, gamemodes, and people from around the world makes this game insanely great and awesome. and you know what is even better? its free! if youre looking for a fun fps or f2p game this is the one to get. sure the download takes some time(forever), but it is well worth the joy youll get form sitting down and wrecking some noobs...after you learn how to not be one. i r8 8/8 m8",2141.1
"probably the best fps multiplayer game of all time. still kicking since 2007 with an awesome community and map creators. still frequently updated by valve with lots of content patches and special updates, which bring new weapons, maps and game modes to this already awesome game.",1181.8

"fantastic game, free to play as well, probably the best free-to-play game ive ever encountered. its simple to play, can run on any pc in terms of graphics, and offers hours upon hours of fun. if you dont have this game, i strongly suggest you install it!",415.0
"team fortress 2 used to be a game. i know thats hard to understand for many of its current players but its true. back when it came out it was a simple, yet well made team based shooter. hats were something old people wore and people paid for the gameplay rather the looks. those were the times. nowadays tf2 is an economy where thousands of dollars change hands every day as people quest for those rare items that will set them apart of the rest. real life money and other games are exchanged for cosmetic items based on rarity rather than function and valve is making money by the truckload. on one hand i want to congratulate them for this utterly brilliant business model that has truly made them a power to behold. on the other hand i cant help but worry that well start seeing more and more games where gameplay is secondary to various forms of dlc and micro-transactions, where people play, not for the game, but for the hope of making money.",2483.2
"this game....let you play like you want,custom most of things,update almost every week,is so fun,is fair to play against equals since the stock wep are not underpowered and well that is all.",745.9
"heck yea! good co-op, fun graphics, pvp, hats! must get especially because its free, and dont worry you dont have to pay to win. people just say that to make themselfs feel bettah for wasteing 150$ on a vintage hat!",350.3
"well, what hasnt been said about tf2? after all, its the sole reason i joined steam...",2479.6
"hello, time for my first formal review, a game ive put over 6.5k hours in over 3 accounts. im going to try my best to not be bias in any way. first of all. be careful of what kind of money you spend in this game. it has costed my over 700$+. but if you dont want to waste your money with virtual items, this this a pretty good fps (for entry level and expirenced fps players) this game is well balanced, with very few items considered op by players. this is a pretty pc heavy game now. id be most optimal with an amd gpu + intel procesor, due to this game being in atx format. not to get off topic. there are 9 classes all with their advandtages and learning curves. but you will be the one who finds your favorite, nobody else. now have some fun, its free after all.",2278.3
"circle of tf2: think youre good --> see people with hats better than yours /| | | |/ | spend $money$ on better hats <-- think youre bad",1754.0
"a classic and still great fun! class based shooter, each class feels very unique and has its advantages and disadvantages. who can complain about anything when it is free, not that there is anything to complain about anyway. loadsa stuff to unlock and lots of fun cosmetics to prance around in. sting like a butterfly and dance like a bee!!",282.2
"swagalicous. as amazing as a t-rex with grabby hands. watch out though or the gaben wizard will take your family",836.1

"it is effing amazing if you like teams and fortresses and numbers after 1 but definitely before 3",1.1
"me 2 months ago: this game is over rated. and this hat craze is silly. i wont get addicted or buy any hats. what zombies you must be to do such a thing. me now: i think i can sell my kidney for some money to buy hats.. wait, i already did. maybe i can go without my other kidney. theyre over rated, anyways. 10/10 would waste whole paycheck on.",1835.4
"i remember when tf2 was good. when there was lots of updates. nowadays, its an almost abandoned  pile, thats absolutely nothing when compared to other fps games like cs:go, payday 2 and even cs 1.6. theres casuals everywhere, theres horrible balance, theres balanced weapons being nerfed, theres absolutely nothing that this game has compared to the cs franchise. id give it a 2/10. get cs:go instead.",1314.1
"excellent game. allows for accurate gameplay with low graphics settings. plus its free, so anybody who is unable to afford a high performance computer can enjoy this gaming just as much! 10/10",927.8

"one day, i noticed a game i had heard about went free. this day was all the way back in june 2011. the game was team fortress 2. now, tf2 is one of my favorite games--perhaps even my #1. why? theres a multitude of reasons, but the combination of skill-based shooting, fast gameplay, and completely absurd customization made this game absolutely amazing. id definitely recommend team fortress 2 to anyone--except rohan. i tried. he hated it. apparently the bad graphics and unrealistic look made him not like the game, as well as the fact that it wasnt realistic enough because rockets dont kill in one hit. rohans an idiot. if rohan ever recommends a game, dont listen to him. hes an idiot. dont be an idiot. dont be rohan. play team fortress 2. piss off rohan and anybody like him with your fancy $5000 spooky glowing golden frying pan . 10/10 would hat simulate again.",588.3
"how much awesomeness can you get for 20$..... oh wait! the game is free! download it right now.",2147.5

"one of the best action, fps games ive played. hours of fun. oh, and the hats are awesome!!!",337.4
"what i think makes counter strike stand out from other mmorpgs is that its graphics are way ahead of its time sure the game is 50 years old but that doesnt matter when the game itself plays like league of warcraft which is why i am giving call of dudy 8 a 10/10.",9.1
"amazing! its free and this game is amazing because it has such a big and succsesful economy!",85.8
"tf2 is one of a kind. with so many styles of gameplay from a capture the flag-like(briefcase), to fighting robots and upgrading (mann vs machine). this game has multiple characters as well with their own, awesome skills. for example, the spy who can become invisible for a limited time, or the scout, allowing speed and a double jump. anyways, this game has so many things to offer and alot of workshop items to buy as well. even if you dont want to buy any thing randomly you will recieve items throughout playing as well. the more you play, the more free stuff you can get; including free holiday-themed things for when those special days come around. it is an extremely fun and addicting game and deserves you to play it. and guess what? its free! download it now and have some fun! happy gaming!",29.6

"in the old ages, it was just buy n play. now look what happened! tf classic has made tf2 to make a great non pay-to-win game! spending money on this is just for looks, not for better op weapons! 5/5! best free to play game ever!",343.3
"this may very well be one of the best games i have ever played, this fun action mann packed multiplayer adventure is a blast from the second start up the menu! using a cartoonish styling makes for colorful unique maps and matches. one of the best parts about this game (other than hats) may be the nine very unique quirky classes who fight over well...gravel. even though it is a free to play game and you can certainly have fun staying free to play, f2p i do recommend that you buy an item from the in game mann co store, only buy a single item and you will be upgraded to a premium account, you will find better items, be able to trade as well as many other features. there is so much more to tell about this game but i alone cannot say it all, you must play this game to trully understand it, if you need tips or help i can and will try my best! have fun and remember.... if you find a gibus...just..just keep it off ok? 9.5/10",1080.5

"id heard some talk about this team fortress 2. my friends loved it and seemed so enthralled in its huge community. i eventually got to playing it myself at a friends house to try it out. i thought it was very complicated and too confusing at first. my friend was screaming, we need a demoknight over here, but everyones too busy being spy and trading! i thought he was insane. my friends badgered me to install it on my computer and told me to play for eight hours straight with them. so i did. my hours are short, and i still am utterly terrible at the game, but here i am just a few hours before writing this screaming into my monitor (mic off accept for my friends) we need a demoknight over here, but everyones too busy being spy and trading! my mom thinks im insane. and even on my crappyt dell computer, this game runs great (with a few graphical adjustements) and keeps me entertained. bottom line, if you get this game, you wont come out of it.",57.3

"this is not a very good game, people talk about it too much and waste unnecissary amounts of money on things like hats and australium items. the game gets boring after a while. there are large amounts of health that make the game less fun. i wouldnt reccomend tf2 to people who are fans of long story games or strategy games, this is a game with short multiplayer matches that you can play over and over again.",0.5

"this is the best game ever i bought alot of items thank you for a awesome game!",1317.7
"honestly, i used to love this game, but now it has become to salty. the main problem is all the hats. now, i love the skin system in cs:go, because not everone acts like an  to you if you have  skins. but if you are walking around tf2 with a gibus, you are called ,f2p, and/or n00b. then the ing conga and bread  came. this game isnt pay2win, and i admire that, but nearly most of the community does not give a flying  how good you are, but cares how many keys your hat is worth. with this game, im ing done with it, go play fortress forever if you want a true tf sequel with no ing hats and bread.",320.9

"the game was very fun for all my buddys at school a year ago but after a while gets a little dull, so we joined servers with different game modes like arena. but alot of people in tf2 im guessing about 60% just play for items to sell its very annoying while playing a game. all people do is try to offer there items out to other people and then sell what they got in return. soon youll join with the trading side i give 1-3 months till your obsessed with hats and trying to get alot to sell and trade. so overall basically gameplay is good when people play. so i recommend this game just stay away from trading and youll have ablast!just trade weapons if ya wanna stay away from hats n crates and dont buy keys btw dont buy a item from store,unless you want more space just buy a 50 cent weapon and then never buy weapons again trade people for them. only weapons",1047.6

"this game is very fun, because of its difference with the other fps games (or should i say tfps?). its difference is in the personality of the characters, and they each do different things. not like 4 people do the same thing just different models. the main reason i play this game is because i am a server hoster and i love modding the game. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- q1: is that redstone? a1: yes q2: what is my server called? a2: sodiumhydroxides server with infinite mvm cash and ammo q3: redstone-minecraft... oh, so you play minecraft? a3: yes and i also host a minecraft server q4: are you a coder? a4: yes of course i am you dumbo q5: did you buy tf2 premium a5: no and i hate people yelliing buy stout shako for 2000 refined!!!!!!!!!!!!",580.0
"team fortress 2 is probably the best free to play shooter. instead of games like call of duty and other games where you dont need your team, team fortress 2 is a game where if you are not a team player, you will lose. this game teaches you patience and each class has their own special ability that no other class can replicate. like the spy has a cloaking ability and a knife to stab others in the back for a one hit kill. engineers can create buildings such as sentries, dispensers and teleporters ( each with the ability to upgade to level 3) if you dont like a characters weapon, the more you play the more you find weapons, hats, crates and such. if you dont feel like finding items, you can buy them in the item shop. the game is constantly having more additions because of steam workshop. with steam workshop any one has a chance to make a new addition to the game. i highly recommend this game. i give this game a 10/10",721.4

"amazing. valve figured out how to do f2p properly. its super balanced, so even the newbie can kill the veteran. all the classes are unique and genuinely have to work together to survive. each class as a nemesis. just got killed from half a mile away by a sniper? go spy and stab him. spy stabbed you? go pyro and barbecue his . get barbecued? go scout and beat him to death with a floppy fish. got beaten to death by a floppy fish? etc. if you can find a decent server with players who actually know what theyre doing, its worth it. theres even a trading economy if youre more of a thinker. all the weapons are equally powerful, even the defaults. the extra weapons arent upgrades, theyre sidegrades so you can tweak your play style. the default scout shotgun is good on its own, but you can replace it with a sawn off double barelled type thing with more damage, but with knockback and only two shots. that sort of thing.",1999.6

"the bots have no real cone of view or anything and can turn around and shoot you in the face on the drop of a really heavy thing that falls fast, people have no idea how to fight, nobody uses melee weapons because you do more damage with a gun, scout moves 2fast2quick, heavy moves as fast as melting ice in the arctic, snipings hard, shotguns dont do much damage, medic is op, vita saw is worthless, ubersaw is amazing if you can hit something, everyone only cares about hats, not weapons or skill and they think conga is the best taunt in the world. 420/10 would bread again",1208.7

"team fortress 2 is an fps game with a singleplayer and multiplayer servers. i think that this game is awesome, but they need to upgrade the weapon/item drop system, it needs to give new players a few more items than people who have been playing the game more often. the textures are somewhat realistic with a sort of cartoony feel to them. the player models are good but could use a little more detail, even if its a cartoony game. basic plot: mann co. a company run by the tough saxton hale who had 3 sons, red, blu, and grey. red and blu exiled grey and fought with eachother like maniacs. grey came back with replicas of red and blus armies, robots. classes: scout, soldier, pyro, demo, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy.",2299.5

"as a cod, i was really blown out of the water by how much i enjoy this game. no class feels overpowered or useless, which really adds variety to the gameplay. even more variety can be found in the different weapons you can unlock for each class. the addition of hats and cosmetic items really has given the game a sense of fun and chaos you dont find in the more generic fps games. (any game where i can hit someone to death with a fish is a plus in my book.)",537.8

"very fun fps game, a f2p masterpiece game in my opinion. the gameplay is very smooth and open to gamers with a different background of gaming. in this game they include a big variety of servers with different maps and gamemodes, but instead of hopping on a server right away, i recommend having experience with the game, so theres a training mode for gamers to tf2",1503.9
"team fortress 2 is a very fun free-to-play game. you can explore and master the 9 different classes with your own load out, and even customize them with hats and misc. items. the trading system is a big part of tf2, because it is another source of getting weapons, hats, or even rarer items. the mann vs machine feature allows your favorite characters to fight against armies of robotic versions of themselves, how fun is that? this is a great and addicting game, i recommend you get it.",391.0

"at its core it is a solid game with classes that seem over powered but are countered by other classes due to different strengths and weaknesses. its not a game you can really get first time playing, but once you have worked out how to use weapons its so much fun. and thats only a part of tf2, theres trading, servers with mods as well as training for rocket jumps and its always constantly being updated. you have no excuse to not try this game. i am sure you wont be disappointed.",2372.0

(like hackers!!!) but it is free to play and you even get free weapons every week so i cant complain much. they even let you spray paint memes (funny pics) onto the walls!!!",448.7
"tf2 is the only shooter that has captivated me and kept me going for such a long time. the entertaining characters and fun to use weapans add a lot too. the unnoficial name of hat forteress 2 is wrong. this is more than a hat fest, its one of the greatest games of all time",1514.1
"its hard to become bored with this game. between the updates, new items, and community based around it, id give tf2 an overwhelmingly positive rating. its competitive, but with a light twist. the personalities of each class definitely contribute to the love as well. it sucks you in, so much so that you begin alienating friends, family, pets, and before you know it youve logged over a thousand hours and youre living behind starbucks in a cardboard box, subsisting on coffee and wifi like a leech. but in your heart you know that it was all worth it, and that everyone and everything not related to tf2 is a distraction keeping you from playing tf2",1096.5

"been playing team fortress since the old days of quake 1 and modems :) still playing to this day which attests to how solid a game this is :) such a huge amount of content provided by valve for free here, and with all the different weapon and gear loadouts in game now, every skirmish is a new experience. for the huge price of entry, youd be a fool not to install tf2 and lose a few dozen hours to comical butchering of your foes :d",138.4
"team fortress 2. this game, is like valves secondary flagship, (we all know too well what is the primary), and because of that, it is one of the best multiplayer experiences one can have. ever. balanced gameplay? check. solid map design? check. loads of players? check. i could go on and on, about how great the community is (excluding the children who should not being playing this game), about how the game is always being updated, about how it is free to play, and so on and forth. there is no better game money could buy. and considering that this is free... sometimes there is good in this world.",1080.6
"free im just joking, but seriously. if you really want to enjoy this game on the fullest you have to buy ingame items to actually get into this game. overall the gameplay is great, also the characters have their own story to tell. if there is a character that you like to play, then team fortress is just the game for you! hop in and choose a character of your liking, sadly as i said in the previous lines.. the cosmetic items are sometimes really expensive, so loosen up your wallet a bit! good points: -dynamic gameplay -easy going and fast learning -fun with friends -a wild variation of weapons to choose of! meh points: -not as free as they telling you -a very annoying kick-system -alot of trade requests",157.2

"whats amazing about this game, is that if valve never made any more updates for this game, the community, even the game itself, could sustain itself, ab kept alive for a very long time. its almost as if it was made to be alive forever. crafting, trading, inventory, cards, item drops, events, its all here. the gameplay is fun, gory, querky, and addicting: everything you need in a game. the absence of an assault rifle is another thing that makes it stand out. it doesnt need to be like cod, or halo, it is what it is, and thats what makes it better than others. it has bird heads, sandwiches, more birds, shotguns, and everything. i highly recomend it. best game ever.",865.9

"incredible time waster! always coming out with new ways to mess around and new hats to wear. its a little weird that a hat simulator such as this game makes it so difficult to wear new hats.. i suppose its the same as any freemium game nowadays. if you want the cool hats, you gotta pay a little extra. overall a good hat simulator. a little violent though.. would recommend",1300.3

"uhhh, best game ever? i mean of course there are plenty of rockin games out there, but this is one hot item ive been playing since it was a mere quake mod ported to valves engine to showcase half-lifes dev kit, and for me theres nothing quite like winding down at the end of a day with a few rounds with my favorite rag-tag team of mercs.",413.8

"possibly one of the worst ports on mac in our human existence. load times that go on for 5-10 minutes+. framerate dipping down to 5 very often, but the average is maybe 15-20 fps. this is odd considering how my machine can run dead space completely smooth on the highest settings, via a wineskin port, meaning that the performance is even worse than what a native port would be. sadly i cant speak for the game itself, why? because of this ing port.",38.1

"entertaining, and quite the adventure. the community is usually decent and the graphics are what they are supposed to be, and quite nice. the game is very much based on useless items such as hats, but the customization is definantly the best ive ever seen in any game before. 9.7/10",658.2

"this game is by far one of the most greatest f2p games i have ever played. the game itself is free to play, however you will see youself having so much fun that you will probably buy atleast one thing in the store to get premium which alows you to trade (which is a big part fo the game) and it also gives you extra backpack slots which will be needed later on. the best thing is some items in the store are only 25 cents so its very cheap to aquire premium. with occuring updates to fix the bugs and add new weapons, and great balancing out of the classes, tf2 deserves a 10/10",446.8
"although the gameplay is still engaging, i dislike the path where the game is going mod-wise; to disable mods entirely on their own servers reduces the opportunity for people to keep themselves engaged with the game creatively. there is still some salvation within the community, but the experience varies.",2546.6

"this game is silly fun.. nothing is more satisfying than backstabbing your mate, great over skype. the teamplay is above average , it actually has a physics engine, which i like. the unlock system is a bit odd and i dont rally understand the crafting, there arent really enough tutorials. i do however have a reocurring problem, on gmod and any other valve game... servers get connection failed after four retries and when i refresh the servers disappear... anyways i have to rate this game positively becuase it is one of the most fun games ive played and i feel the developers put lots of effort into it. 8/10",14.7

"i love this game, and strongly recomend it to everyone. i rate it 5 out of 5.",69.3
"this game is addicting. i play it almost every day. i like how each of the classes have a different role and i also like how you have to change classes when there is an obstacle only one class can get rid of. its amusing how a lot of people (including me) immediately want to pick the spy class and then find out that its much more difficult than they imagined. tf2 seems like it was made to be the perfect fps.",93.4

"a dynamic first person shooter where the weapons you choose are almost as strategy changing as the class you choose to play. while playing against other players, acting like an idiot can be more effective in preventing the enemy team from completing their objective than trying to kill them. each class has a unique personality as characters and to play as, ranging from a russian bear to insane patriots flinging themselves at enemies without any regard for their own safety. this is one of the few games i have played which does teamwork right. also there are hats.",2405.0

"tres bien! im not french but i think this game is so good it deserves to be said in a fancy way.",14.0
"if you like combat games, i would heartily recommend this game. the integration of the different classes with their different strengths and weaknesses means that there is a class for everyone, be it a more directly offensive rule like the heavy or demoman, or more support-related like the engineer or medic. the game is not completely free to play, as there is a mode, mann vs. machine, where a purchase is required for participation, as well as a store where weapons and optional accessories (known by the collective term of hats) can be purchased. these areas are, however, completely optional, and avoiding them detracts in no way from the main gameplay. edit: thanks mozaux for pointing out boot camp. yes, a free version even of mvm is available. however, it is true that you cannot gain rewards for this mode as you would in mann up mode, as the paid version is called.",816.6

"i started playing tf2 because a friend of mine highly reccomended it and the fact that it was free. i am going to be honest, i had an extremely hard time getting into this game at first. in my opinion there is a very heavy learning curve in the game. it seemed that i just died, and died, and died even more! then i looked into the community forums and read up on guides and strategies. then i actually did the in game tutorials for onccce in my life. i have also been playing with bots just to hone my skills and my internet has been a bit slow lately. slowly but surely, i can see myself improving at this. this game does a really good job of introducing a new challenge and rewarding players for their experience, not their willingness to pay to win. its addictive, funny, and a great free game. there is literally nothing stopping you from getting team fortress 2 and having insane amounts of fun, so why not give it a try?",18.4

"dont buy this game if you would like to see the outside every once and awhile. in all seriousness this is a shooter that has a huge following, for good reason. most of the classes feel balanced, even though if you specialize in one class they wont. the greatest thing about this game is its not pay-2-win. most of the weapons you get in the game are actually just side-upgrades from the regular weapons. in fact, many times the main weapon is the weapons you use most of the time. defiantly download, after all, its free,",156.9

"simply put, one of the greatest competitive multiplayer games ever created. having played almost everything in the online fps genre from the classics to the modern hits, team fortress 2 is the single game of the bunch that has kept me entertained years later; six years and counting thus far. the look and feel to the game and its characters ooze charm and personality. the plethora of different looks and loadouts keep the game fresh, with more new things coming out all the time. the gameplay itself is easy enough to pick up for immediate gratification, yet deep enough where it can take hundreds, if not thousands of hours to master any given playstyle. whether you just put in spare time over a weekend, or dedicate several hours every day, tf2 has a way of making you feel constantly satisfied and rewarded as the years go by. having adopted an extremely fair free-to-play business model now, theres no reason to not give it a go.",1236.6

"ai is really good, they even can put up sprays and talk in the chat. only downside to this is most of them are programmed as bronies. valve really should consider putting multiplayer into this game, singleplayer gets really stale even with all the work they did on the ai. 9.75/10",274.7

"the 9 classes in team fortress 2 are well balanced, which make for a very enjoyable but challenging game. however, most newcomers will expect a great deal of frustration, which can make a player believe that they are simply not good at the game. the veterans typically dominate these newbies. if one is patient enough, they can learn to enjoy the game. i, of course, have to mention hats. the economy aspect of the game has me hooked right now. i dont even know if i want help or not. final verdict: great game. just try not to get sucked into the world of hats (although its inevitable).",891.7

"a really really good game!!! its not those pay to win games. what matters in this game is your skills!! when u first started playing this game, u may always get killed. but when u finally be familiar with the maps and try to improve ur skills (e.g. stop w+m1 and start using degreaser + airblast + shotgun/flare gun) u will find that u can be the mvp more easily. just dont be mad and frustrated when u got dominated by someone and rage quit. try to learn from others. u will find urself being better you may even be strong enough to join the competitive community :)",2135.2

"this game has been around for almost 7 years might go for its tenth year and i could see why. what i like about this game is how well its balanced, not just in weapons but in the classes themselves. every class and its gun has its up and downs. no sense of it being a pay-to-win game. cheapest gun is low as 0.49 cents and as i said before alot of the guns are fairly balanced. oh yeah you cant forget about the hats... hats hats hats!!!!! you can customize your charactor with whatever apperal or hats. whether you wanna make look badass or just flat out stupid the choices are yours. some people could say that hats are killing the games. alot of the updates has just hats and it could be annoying, buts the hat could go either way. the hats has open up a new world for tf2 but there is more hats then there is guns. but i could see why its pretty hard to make a gun that is fairly balanced. so i would say this game gats a 9/10",175.3
"it is a must have game i recommend it to everyone.",479.2

"team fortress 2 is a unique game in many respects, first and foremost being just how much (and for how long) its been updated. while its only recently gone free, valve has been supporting the title for years with rather significant content additions, and game-breaking bugs tend to get squashed within hours or days, rather then the months that some other companies take with even their flagship titles. its also interesting in the fact that you dont actually have to be a living god at first-person shooters to do well or support your team. the engineer and medic help their allies out with their buildings and healing abilities, and the hundreds of items available can change any of the classes capabilities significantly. and, of course, the game is infamous for its cosmetic items, such as the hats, which dont typically provide any real bonus but do allow you to customize your character further. you have to play this game. and if youre on steam, you already own it!",1026.9

"i totally recommend this game to anyone interested. tf2 is a first person shooter... kinda. this game can involve wacky shenanagins, like bumper cars, giant strongman games, silly cosmetics, and watching really bad players. what i really like is that you can get almost a full experiance with the free to play option, with only some crafting, trading, and inventory space being limited. the only downsides to this game are the cost of some items, like keys and paints, and the glitches. oh the glitches. although sometimes funny, they can be a real hassle. there are times when you cant join games, have trading errors, are unable to turn or quite, and can only swing your current weapon, glitches caused by using the chat, and anything along those lines. overall though, this game can be a lot of fun for people of many ages.",841.8

"team fortress 2 is the ultimate free to play game. its been going strong since 2007 and will continue to be a great game for many more years to come. most free to play games are pay to win nowadays but team fortress 2 is different, its pay to have hats, and hats make you look stylish. you can also get jackets and such but hats are the . the gameplay it self is fantastic, there are nine different classes and each play a role in the game. gradually overtime you collect weapons and such for each class and there are s of items in this game and they are still throwing out updates adding weapons, cosmetics, maps ect. the graphics arnt tood bad either for a game made back in 2007, it has its own style and looks overall great. overall i think this game is a whole new take on fps games and is better than most games you can buy so i rate this game 1010 incredibly enjoyable. hope this review helped you make up your mind either to download this or not !",94.1

"its a great game and i appreciate the 9 years worth of work put into this, but like every game; there are flaws. its mainly glitches and exploits like the sandvich exploit to get endless points without cheating but this game sets the standards for what a first person shooter should be and if you had a mind you would think the same. thank you ~kaifyre",1594.8

"i love this game the cartoon style, the weapons, the characters. whatever your play-style be having fun? trolling? fooling around and even playing competitively like me this game has it all. i really recommend this game at the begging i though it was just another first person shooter but boy was i wrong. no wonder this game has been going for so long its surprisingly fun. but above everything my favourite feature this game has to offer is the custom sprays, upload any (jpeg) image and simply press t while in game to show other players your own personalised spray. on a final note i have recently bought some weapons from the shop and they are really good i recommend buying some weapons when you start off to make it a little easier.",526.4
