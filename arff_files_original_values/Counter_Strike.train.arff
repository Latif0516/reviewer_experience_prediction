"counter strike 1.6 is a good game. it used to be sooooo much better, but now there are hardly any servers running, and even less vanilla counter strike servers(servers without mods). unless your a hardcore counter strike player, id reccomend you just get cs:go. the gameplay is better in the first place, there is workshop, and billions of hours of content. back in the day 9.8/10 now...6/10 dont be hatin",82.1

"the predecessor of all fps games! try it out today!",635.9
"the greatest multiplayer shooter experience ive had since quake 1. the e-sport scene also helped it alot, its the only computer game ive really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when i followed the cpl etc). the design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. the call of duty and battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like counter-strike.",477.4

"probably my favorite to play . yes we get lots of hacks but... its too much fun to play . cs ftw.",2312.9
"i used to play this game with my friends when we had to do military service; it was a lot of fun pretending that we were fighting russians while putting to use what we would learn during training. however, it seems that the only people who play now are turkish children who hack and have bad ping so, i would not recommend this game any more.",131.9

"why did i got vac ban for not having cs: go ? u baned me for cheating in cs: go + i dont haw cs:go!!! that lame steam ... just taking money from kids, and thats all .",38.9
"ah, the beauty of old gaming remains. this game is more than just alive and kicking, even though its old by now. its a nice game which focus more on skill and reflexes than cute graphics and advanced functions. if you like fast-paced shooter youll probably like this one too. theres lots of mods, addons and maps out there... since this is an older game which allow people to create their own through 3rd-party software. in my opinion, that alone make this game awesome.",273.9
"play the worlds number 1 online action game. engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. take out enemy sites. rescue hostages. your role affects your teams success. your teams success affects your role.",93.4
"from my personal experience i think is the best multiplayer game ever created the one and only",13.3
"fy_iceworld, cs_bloodstrike, de_rats, fy_poolday, awp_map, wc3mod, surf, dodgeball, ahh the memories",24.3
"best game evaaahh! buut, cs:go can be the same enjoyable and fun! :d",129.8
"if you cant get counter-strike: global offensive, this is great replacement for it. its not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. some servers may be in languages you cant understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. one of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. although the games graphics...arent really the best. even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. though to me, graphics dont really matter. highly recommend this game. 9.5/10",11.3
"fellas i have long been playing this game and i would recommend to you to try it because it is very intresting game for those who like shooters :)",128.2
"it was my favorite game, but since steam tried so much to screw this game with all that useless updates that ruied it...and it dosent work on windows 8, plus they got out d3d the only option that you had if you have windows 8, now...its a piece of crap, if we are talking about cs 1.6 when steam gived a **** about it, then its a 10/10 but now its just a 5/10 or 4/10 rip cs 1.6 thanks a lot steam! :(",216.7
"they should make a counter strike remake of deleyed scenes and the old school one .",121.0

"omg this cases skol shotings b& it plz nvm it cool game play it dont shot ppl in the irl tho guns r bad mkay",1.6
"gotta play. may seem old, but classic. highly recommend.",9.2
"the simple fact that this 10+ years old game still shows up in the top played games on steam clearly says something about its quality. i feel like i shouldnt even recommend it, as its name speaks for itself. easy to pick up, difficult to master, counter-strike is one, if not the best multiplayer fps out there, and itll probably remain that way for many years to come. the fact that this game rivals it sequels in number of players worldwide only shows how great this game is. so, do yourself a favour and get it.",11.4
"absolute classic, for only ten bucks why the hell not!",14.3
"this game will always be my favorite counter-strike and its a game from my younger years that i enjoyed. not alot of people play it anymore but its still good. id just get a bunch of friends to buy it and have a 5v5 lan. c: :3 <3",97.9

"absolutely, this is the classic shooter game everyone should try it .",109.2
"this game is unlike the other counter strike games. this game requires a different type of skill. you have to become used to the recoil each weapon has. you also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map. i personally think this is the best counter-strike game.",65.7
"recommended 10/10. everything , i really mean everything in this game is great. (except for the graphics , but if im not wrong this game is from 1999 ,sooooo... yeah , just buy it)",79.3
"counter-strike is defiantly dated, so i recommend getting the newer ones, but you are not going wrong with this one if you decide to pick it up. 7/10",0.1
"the original and possibily still the best (minus the riot shields). if you love nostalgia as much as i do, and you dont own this game but used to play it at lan cafes maybe? get it already!",1.2
"counter-strike is the best first-person online shooting game. because it depends only in your own skills. there are no advantages like in call of duty series, you will need to aim correctly, know the recoil of your gun and shoot your enemies to death.",556.7

"probably the greatest team fps that there ever was, was way ahead of its time in all departments. still to this day has full servers full of dedicated players 24-7. to think that it was originally just a half life mod shows that you dont need to spend a fortune to make a great game",518.5

"one of the first games i played, brings back so much memories. and its ing fun.",14.3

"classic superb multyplayer game, but till steam the hot air is out. is it the servers? the players? the stupid fan-mods? i dont know....",7.1
"in my opinion 1.6 has less hacker than counter-strike:global offensive. then again 1.6 is made up of a few servers with small coumminty base and more than likely has an admin in game. best physics in any counter-strike game. probably not top notch graphics.. just get your friends and have a piss",126.0
"did anyone not play this game at some point or another. as elusive to me as football and stock car racing in its ability to transfix the lives and minds of some shall we say, unenlightened gamers out there.",5.4

"looking for online gaming.. this is the best solution.. :) .... i have csgo still prefer to play this..",714.7
"when it boils down to competitive long lasting first person shooters, counterstrike 1.6 is king. the unique money system on a two team map design is what puts counterstrike apart from other run and gun fpss. many custom maps and mods are available, while still boasting a steady player base even 15 years after release.",1359.5
"endless fun i could end up with over 1000000 hours on this game xd. everyone sucks at first because with this game its all about practice and trying things out, seeing what weapons you are good with etc etc. anyone can be good at this game its all about how much time you put into it as long as you have some very basic fps know-how you could master it for sure.",24.5

"a beacon of online gaming, that despite being a dated title, so many players come back to it because of the well defined game mechanic. theres no great depth of content, just a simple yet enjoyable platform for team deathmatch with map objectives thrown in. years ago i spent atleast 1,000 enjoyable hours playing it.",46.9

"the multiplayer fps that started it all. might be a old game, but its better than cod, also, even though the graphics are , that doesnt mean the game is. instead of picking your loadout, you get in-game money to buy weapons from a menu. there are no attachments to the weapons. there isnt that much to say, but its still very good. final verdict 10/10 classic.",7.8
"launched the game, joined a random server , laughed about 43 minutes because of the graphics and animations, got rekt by some fgts , insulted them and their families , closed the game and laughed again because i acted ridiclous , opened the game again, rejoined the server, insulted them again , closed the game another time and laughed enough to cry a bit. one of the best gaming experiences i ever had. 9.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10 would get eye cancer because of the graphics again. its not a full 10 because there are no 499 knifes.",0.7

"best game ever made... domination of movemenet, shooting mechanics - recoil... exaclty what a fps game need... when developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good fps, they will make a game as good as cs 1.6 is... cs:go does not have these major aspects, and doesnt deserve name of counter-strike (imo). as a third very important thing for fps game, i would say the animations... the animations of player models such as runnig, walking, crouching, gun holding/fireing/reloading etc... graphics isnt so important, doesnt need to be sooo good, but decent due to visibility...",789.7

"the game is good, but not a lot of people play the original anymore. if you dont have any friends who play this one, stick to cs source, because the few servers in the original that are populated are not exactly your standard modes usually. but a good competitive shooter none-the-less",1.2
