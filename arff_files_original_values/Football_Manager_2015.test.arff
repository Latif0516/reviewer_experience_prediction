"i found the 2015 version to be so much better than the previous years. get it.",189.9
"doesnt work and sports interactive have no clue how to help me. how do i get a refund??",7.3
"i played fm2012 from its release until recently, when i purchased fm2015. i played a friends fm2013 and again 2014 - but there wasnt a big enough reason for me to buy the new games as i was still enjoying 2012. i decided this year to buy the new fm2015. new features, player updates, great match engine etc. what could go wrong? lots. the match engine is pathetic. thats the only word for it. heres why: keepers constantly spill the ball onto opposition players. midfield just stand off and stand off, no tackles made. just run up, stop, watch the player run past. regardless of what tactics you use (i.e close down more, harder tackling etc). the amount of goals conceded by corners or long range wondergoals is a joke. im in the scottish premiership right now, theres no way my team should be conceding the types of goals they have been. whats worse - for some reason when i turned the match engine off and went back to the classic only commentary mode - these ridiculous goals stopped! i went the next season undefeated! im now persevering in my 4th season. with my team having 60%+ possession, 30+ shots, 8 on target, lost 3-1 to a team with 10s & 11s finishing. wtf? if i still had my old laptop id look for a player update on fm2012 and stick with that. i feel as though this game and its engine is really flawed. going from beating liverpool (with celtic) 4-0 away from home and then losing 3-0 to st mirren after dominating the game? yeah ok.",426.6
"love this game also have had hours of fun well worth the money",155.6
"its wierd at first and the default skin is terrible but after a few hours into it you start to get used to it. scouting is actually allot more important than ever now and you go into your scouting tab in order to search for players that are transfer listed etc, based on your scouting knowledge. you can see how everything is working allot more now and makes it important to have feeder clubs from different countries to improve scouting knowledge across the globe. touchline instructions are cool in theory but i found it to be pointless and makes your team worse off, just stick with the pre match and half time team talks. match engine is allot better and it feels more fluid with the animations however are there some dodgy stuff that happens especially when 2 or 3 defenders are trying to chase down a loose ball then none of them end up getting it and leave it whilst a surging striker latches onto it and scores when they shouldent of had any chance of getting it. the only bad thing really for me is the default skin but thats a personal thing, as for the game its solid and a solid upgrade. if youve not got a fm game for a while then deffo pick this up, if you get them every year then you should see more improvements this year than you have the previous years to warrent getting it aswell.",314.4
"almost 30 hours into beta 15.0.2 the game is perfectly playable right now, but there are some issues with defending, which im sure will be patched before launch this friday. if in doubt then wait till the full release and reviews of the patched version before paying up.",128.3
"amazing game, really love the number of upodates and mods available for thsi game to. truly customisable.",567.0
"0/10 it broke my screen and made me fail all my exams but i won the capital one cup, so its all ok",305.6
"why is every single injury in this game for me a sports hernia (out for 4-5 weeks). i am 4 seasons in on a save and in the bpl and i have had no injurys that lasted for more than 3 months but at any given time my goalkeeper and at least 2 of my first team players are out with a sports hernia. other than that good game.",174.5
"only negative i can say is in my 3rd season with man utd i hit some sort of glitch that meant i couldnt win away from home! seriously, my home record was; played 19 won 18 drew 1... away record; played 19, won 3, drew, 6, lost 10. i had scores like loosing 2-1 to brentford (whom had been promoted) leading arsenal 4-1 with 10 mins to go, to drawing 4-4. beat city at old trafford 5-0 and lost at the etihad 5-3. the scores throughout that season just seemed very random, no matter what i did. other than that its very much same old fm (which there is nothing wrong with) already played 71 hours. trying to catch up on the 600+ hours i played of the last edition haha",194.1
"brilliant game. got to say im addicted to it at the moment. as you can probably tell by how many hours ive played. its quite difficult at times but i got walsall to win league 1 in my first season so im pretty happy.",342.1
"as always a briliant game. never fails to impress at all",21.3
"its ok .. it can sometimes make you happy.....but alot of times really really angry....i would reccomend it but the most id pay 4 it would be 25$...",241.7
"review after update 15.03 the game goes much nicer then the first one after this update, match engine improvement, many bugs been solved though some not fixed yet, but its expected since its still on beta. cant wait the full release on november 7, i hope by that time most of the remaining bugs or maybe all the bugs are fixed. i love the side bar panel on this year version, sure need time to get used to it but for me its more simple and nice to see, they put much more detail on feature on this year version too like team talk etc. many improvement from last year version that i cant write it all but for me its worth to buy it though its still on beta and even more worth to buy after the 15.03 update. almost 100 hours playtime on two weeks for me that mean this is a game that worth to be in your library if you like to become a football manager.",394.5
"the beautiful game just ot a make over. after playing the series for a number of years now, i was expecting the same thing. yet it seems so much improved on things i didnt even know needed improving. 1 example is the competitions menu. it shows where you are in the league and cups. the staff are more helpful and i like the introduction to tunnel interviews. the 3d graphics now involve motion capture in them and look much improved. 1 thing that is really noticeable is tweaking a system. example, my false 9 striker was not getting any goals but i was winning games. i change him to poacher and he gets bucket loads. if you love football and you love the idea of managing your fave team, get this, its a no brainer.",189.5
"i am playing this game till 98. i am a big fan. till now. 2015 is totally hearhbreaker. i did not like it at all. it supposed to be more realistic then last year but its not. main skin is so bad and also we dont have any other skin in it. last year it was very hard to move bigger clubs. i started my carrier with fenerbahe (former turkish champion) at 2015. first year i won league and turkish cup. next year i won league and i qualifed champions league group. on second round bara came to me. i eleminate 5-4 aggregiate. it was nice. then i received many contract offer from many clubs. sevilla, bilbao and then juventus. i accepted offer from juve. juve had bad year they were 3 and many unhappy players in it. within 2 weeks i received another offer which is not normal. real madrid came to me after 2 weeks at juventus. i did not win anything. i just eleminate psv 8-0 aggragate.. thats it? is this enough for real madrid? 2 league champions turkey, 1 turkish cup, 1 champions league group qualify. man, you need to fix this game as soon as possible.",253.5
"this is the 2nd time i have decided to give a review of this game, my first review i gave a negative review out of frustration down to the game keep crashing, however after uninstalling and reinstalling and giving it a good go i have decided to change my review to a more positve review, under reviewal though im not sure i can wholeheartedly give this a 100 pcnt positive review so mid writing this review ive reviewd my decision to review. 6/10 not enough progression from previos versions for me",107.3
"i love this game since 2003 and this year all changes great so i dont know what u are doing but i will start my carrer right now",50.3
"great game if this is what you are into, football club simulator basically at its core. when you get into it you keep wanting to see what happens after the next match. wish i had more time to play",82.5
"--- below is my original review, but i have changed it from recommended to not recommended, because even after patching, the game and match-engine is unrealistic; how could the programmers not realise this? i regret buying it and have gone back to fm14.--- this game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, though it does have its problems. id definitely recommend this to fans of the series. lets go through the pros and cons: pros: - i like the new ui, i think its improved on previous titles, with things like scouting/transfers in more logical places - it runs smoother: you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match; instead it takes less than 2 seconds. this means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time. - i havent seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries; its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me. -player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved cons: - weirdly takes longer to save than fm14. over a minute and a half for me. - the games are too high scoring, and this needs to be patched for realism purposes. i just had 5 games that were 6-3, 6-3, 5-3, 0-0 (lol) and 6-3 again... a bit silly... - goalkeepers are pretty bad, hence the high scores. - it feels like its harder to play a possession game, but that might be just because im leicester. its a fun game; im definitely glad i bought it. good for fans of the series; if patched it could be brilliant. they say theyve solved the issue of too many fks going in, but they dont seem to have",88.9
"absoutely love the new interface. only thing i dont like is that there is a large emphasis on scouting this year, much much more so than last years edition.",123.4
"actually feel ive been robbed of 30 and angry enough to bother posting a first review. dont think ive played a cm/fm game thats been this broken before. ive tried playing lower and higher division teams (started 4 games so far and struggled to play even a couple of regular season games) but there doesnt seem to be any consistency in how tactics/ players affect a game. to think i quit my most recent fm14 game 13 seasons in for this...",223.1
"its a good game but the heading is a bit.......but i recommend",40.3
"seriously bug after 15 minutes ,, all players in club change :d wow",0.8
"this game is extremely bad. never play it. its broken and unfair. thank you.",297.5
"10/10. this game has ruined more of my hours than anything else.. have been playing football manager games even before steam ! absolutely sucks you in. the best part is when the players you scouted and picked up in game for cheap become super stars in real life :)",167.8
"it has many bug on macbook pro (osx 10.10 yosemite). ex. every quality of match graphic isnt smooth. please deverlop for osx 10.10",1.4
"can i be a manager please then thisg ame inviented",1.5
"i have been reading through the reviews for this game, yet i cant understand how people have said how rubbish they thing this new release is? of course its going to have some bugs/faults/issues with the game as soon as it comes out, just like any other pc game you buy, none are perfect as soon as theyre released due to companies being pushed to release their games quicker so that they ensure they make a fast profit. you just need to be patient, like i was. once the bugs were fixed and it was all how it was supposed to be, this is a really good game. probably the best one out of the fm series yet, due to you have to actually scout and search for certain player that you want/need. instead of their being a huge list of transfer listed players available, so its hit and miss on whether you get bargains or you end paying the full price. which is extrememly realistic. the 3d graphics have been improved making it more realistic on the pitch especially with the new team talk feature allowing you to shour specific instructions to your team. the only downside is that sega have yet again tried and failed with the media, i started of as a conference north team (chorley fc) yet i have press conferences before and after every game. surely a team that has only just made it to the conference north, shouldnt be having this many press conferences/tunnel interviews if they havent even been fully estabilished by anyone hardly? it just makes it seem like they havent put much thought into the media. overall i am pretty much on this game all the time now, its extrememly addicting, i would advice anyone to purchase this. plus 30 for a pc game is nothing these days? bargain.",98.3
"yearly shovelware cash cow. a crippled cash cow at that. i have to hand it to si, they manage year after year to make the game worse. i get the feeling that their ambition far outstripped their abilities sometime in 2011 but the sheer arrogance on show refuses to admit it.",655.4
"massive fm fan and this game will be another great one in the list! however, if you enjoyed fm14 you will be dissapionted! big changes that will take time to adapt to. however i shall put my trust in miles and co.",228.5
"great game the game is more like real and finally get better graphics. but there is some goalkeeper bugs need fix in beta and also the 1 on 1 is hard to score i only see my team score 1 1on1 at 1 season.",87.6
"shitest game ever , cant even open game seriously crash files with shitest support in community.sigames every thread not solve my problem even ftp i must install filezilla and upload by myself . i never seen this before.",0.5
"jos mourinho just won premier league with chelsea in 2015, then decides to apply for everton manager vacancy only to end up at napoli. carlo ancelotti leaves real madrid for tottenham. andr villas-boas leaves zenith for fiorentina only to declare interest for atltico madrid job a couple of days later...very realistic, not! argentine premier league rules are totally fictional, etc. si games seem to have totally lost its mojo with this game.",1.5
"better and easier to use ui, better match engine with more realistic movement. more tactic and role chose",421.0
"good game but takes 3 minutes at least to save the game ...please fix that",136.7
"i shall try keep this brief as this is making me miss more time in game, i have only played this version and its predecessor, fm 14 was a great game in its own right and not many improvments needed to be done, in my opinion, then i strarted fm 15, straight away you can see the changes esp with the new and improved interface, it does take a little time getting used to but it is alot more in depth, the tactics page, you have alot more options on this giving players more options on how to play, one of the major flaws however in this years edt of the game which i hope they fix with a patch, is how many players get injured in a season, it feels more of an action game that could rival max payne games, my squad lost 3 keepers for 4 months all due to the same injury at around the same time, that is also not to mention all the other injuries i suffered thru the season, i also played an internation competion as england and somehow managed to beat germany 8 - 2, as much as i loved the sore line to the game and i buzzed for a while, in reality this is not possible, overall the game is very addictive and if youre into these kind of games, a must buy",62.3
"ive been playing football manager since 2005. this is without a doubt the most frustrating and unrealistic installment purely because of a buggy game simulation. sit and watch the 3d matches being played and youll be impressed at some nice new animations, but the game being played infront of you will make you want to put your fist through your monitor... - strikers miss 90% of 1 on 1 chances. - chances that should result in a goal often dont and come around far too often than in real life. - defenders that wander all over the place and dont tackle. - wingers that seem content to run into defenders rather than cross/pass the ball even if a teammate is in tons of space. that just names a few. needs a patch. a big one.",118.3
"my game is not working give me your saport.........",188.1
"recently moved from fm13 to fm15 (only because fm13 developed some bug preventing it loading, not sure why) and have to say im really disappointed....menu options and buttons just disappear and picking/ changing your team isnt as easy.....removing players from the team, the player position box too big so other useful info cant be displayed, when making subs you cant tell what positions the players you have available can cover etc etc. perhaps its a case of getting used to it but seriously considering trading it in and getting a new fm13. poor.",55.8
"wond load now - keep getting taken to this site. whats up? how do i fix it? should buy championship manager instead?",866.5
"this game is highly reccommended by me. 100% buy. the game has had a huge improvement from 2014 and the game has come a long way since it first started. 1 huge feature that they have improved is the way your team listen your advice and it can actually make a difference in your. new features making it a more realistic manager simulator. the wide range of players and team availabe and giving you a chance to choose how much of an experienced manager you are. this is a must buy to big football manager fans and dont be dragged into it being a copy of last years version. to me it is a huge improvement from 2014. must buy!",86.5
"my fm crashes on the 1st july 2015 & the error is error 41! how to i solve it??",225.8
"i have played this game for 4 weeks, and yes i have every version of all their games, so i am a football buff, but this game is different, i purchased as a download, and i have no transfer list, i have no way of changing payments from $ to sterling, your players do not follow orders, so if you say mark tighter, they dont, oh yeah the downloads for the game dont work either, in fact i would say this game sucks, and please do not purchase it. it is .",198.5
"some good additions, little change but they produce a decent game every year.. was buggy at the start but im have no issue now",120.7
"i have had football manager since 2010, enjoyed playing iit greatly for years. i enjoyed the ability to micromanage the little things in the game mainly the sliders. if my team was getting scored on a great deal move thedefensive line slider back a few notches of which i had twenty. a few years ago they decided to do away with the sliders but keep them optional to simplify the game. fine i still have them... the last few years completly gone, and its obvious to anyone who plays the game that the system is exactly the same, the player and team instructions are still moving sliders in the background. so i am at the point where i am just not interested in the game anymore, i am sure there are people out there that like to tinker and micromanage their games, people that enjoy games like europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2. football manager has been one of my favorite games i hope they can listen to their fans and bring back what we all loved about the game.",42.7
"avoid. ive had the game crash on me nearly 20 times in less than a week. si are not doing anything to resolve the issue, other than to ask us to turn down settings to make the game less enjoyable.",553.6
"constant crashing issues, not just the game closing but also ends up closing steam. ive never had an issue running a fm game since now. this needs to be fixed",402.6
"not much can i say, except from this is the best game in the world.",336.4
"my team had over 60% possession and 30 shots, half of which were on target. my opponent only got 1 shot. guess what? my opponent beat me with a 90 min goal. 100% would break my computer.",30.8
"i see some improvements in the graphics. i have tried the game four times now and had 39 injuries, which is quite unrealistic. also, you drill a counter tactics and never ever display transitions where you catch the opponent off balance. i have been a coach for many years and to actually see the tactics trained expressed in the graphics... well.. it aint happening. thus the game lacks realism.. or ability to convert programming into challenging gameplay.",229.7
"great game very addictive played the football game for a while now and they only seem to get beeter each time",217.1
"i was thinking that this game will be a simple copy of fm2014. it is not. and it is better. i cant say that is a lot of new improvements because its false. however, there three main important things. - new interface (left-side useful navigation) - new tips and very intuitive - a new physics motor more realistic so, if you like watching some matches then buy it !",130.6
"ive always been a fan of football manager games, so this review will be a bit biased (when i say a bit, i mean completely). if you have played the previous fm games and are a fan then i would recommend buying this. you will lose hours and hours of your life playing this. if you havent played an fm games before and are enthuastic about football management, theres no time better than now to play this. i cant really tell you the difference with fm14 and fm15, apart from an updated database but there apparently some new features.",322.6
"applies only for the linux port of fm2015 -------------------------------- i really loved football manager series. i am not going to expalin what they are or how to play them. i am really happy they tried to bring it to linux. but they have failed. the game freezes constantly. sometimes when you click continue, sometimes when you try to offer a contract to someone. when it freezes, there is no solution - you have to kill the process. crashing/freezing like this 3 or more times per game week is simply unacceptable and completely ruined gameplay for me. the freezing issue is quite common on their forums, but there is no constructive response whatsoever. i am disappointed with the linux port of the game and dont recommend anyone buying into frustrations like this. --------------- ubuntu 14.04, most popular distribution, with a good radeon driver on which everything seems to run just fine.",171.5
"its still the classic football manager, but.... the new interface just inst quite as intuiative as the old. some good new features but a few bad. perhaps i need time to get used to it, but i have had to look some things up to work out how to do them. there is definate room for improvement. not too sure about the role you play as a coach either but that might develop.",3.8
"the worst and most bugged release ever. dont buy it until feb. needless to say, my problems are the same of other people: tennis score, conceding a lot from corners etc. this release is a fraud.",111.8
"poor gameplay, everyone is injured within a month, teams asking ridiculous prices for youngsters, 3d gameplay isnt that different, might as well apply no tactics doesnt really affect the game. not worth the money, feels like such a lazy job done on this one keep playing fm 14 doing yourself a favor trust me. played every fm since the franchise came out and this one is just failtastic.",22.5
"can anyone tell me how play on ipad? ive downloaded the game to pc but want it on ipad aswel/instead",226.3
"bought the game today because there was supposed to be a patch to fix the terrible defence and injury problems. i just started my first ever save and i already have 16 players injured. every time i hit continue i was just waiting to see how long the next injury would be. also, if you thought this game had any semblance of defensive players actually doing anything other than scoring own goals or watching players walk right passed them you are in the wrong place. i realize this is the beta but the release is in 4 days and i dont see them fixing that many problems with a comlpetely broken game. ill play it again on release and the next patch but im back to fm 2014 (not much better) until then. will update review upon full release and/or next patch. edit: next game after writing this review i had 3 players injured during the game. this takes my total to 19 injuries before the season even begins. my reserve squad is nothing but loans and more injured players as well. maybe thats just bad luck but seriously how can this many people be injured long term all at once?!? update: upon playing the full release i can officialy say that the defense is still terrible and starting a new save fresh for the release has resulted in 9 injuries before the end of the preseason with crewe alexandre. so i am no longer playing the beta and as i guessed the problems have still not been sorted out. guess ill just be waiting until they patch more to start again. if im going to lose my life to my football manager addiction it wont be to a severely bugged match engine.",112.4
"put simply, this game is simply not worth buying in its present state. needs a huge overhaul of gameplay mechanics. when spending a good deal of money for a new game, you expect it to be in a playable state.",7.0
"you cant even control your players. ill buy pes next year",504.3
"i cant recommend this in its current state. too many injuries and a poor match engine with either unlikely goals or very lopsided results or where you can have all the best players, be accomplished in all your tatics and have 100% motivation and still lose to the same team because the match engine decides you have to lose even though you have better possession, attack and a whole bunch of players. i had one game where the opposition went in and stoked it up and i had 9 injuries as a result with the opposition having no yellow cards. the match engine seems not to reward those who attempt to play possession based soccer and it seems a case of just learning the same couple of tatics and rotating them or changing from control to attacking and you can win way too easily (unless the game refuses to let you win against one team...) buying and selling players well a lot of the decent youth players the opposition wants in excess of 90 million pounds for. went back to 2012 and had more fun then i did with fm15, after one season on 15 im out, mabye after feb it will be better but for now i cant be stuffed.",78.7
"if people are terrible at this game they shouldnt be allowed to write reviews for it, which is what 90% of the negative reviews seem to be. great game, so immersive, and a real challenge when starting at the lower leagues. 10/10",156.7
"much better than 2014. simple lay out and good fun. a must buy!",385.6
"i cant enable in game community to access the in game editor. can someone help?",152.2
"i hope the game include full game packs so we dont donlot to another sites..",51.6
"ive already bought the game. but when i go onto steam i cant load the game up. does anyone know what i can do",177.8
"overall the best fm gameplay ever !!! im hooked on to this fm15",333.8
"a long time fm fan but this game is just . not only does it not improve on earlier versions but its worse. feel ripped off and will think twice before buying another si game from here on in,",110.8
"this game deserves the nobel prize! well, it should deserves a big awards of some sort. the main reason is because of its compelling nature, no one will be able to hop off the fm15 train once they have set foot in. as a big football fan, it is an honour that i get to play and experience one of the most intricated and dedicated football simulation ever. so please if you are ever wondering what to do on a wet and stormy tuesday night, the best solution is to immerse yourself into what is known as fm15.",523.8
"i really want to like this game, but i just cant! was a waste of 30 if im honest. ridiculous scorelines, too many injuries, the referees are far to card happy and they constantly give stupid penalties. the match engine is rubbish and abit predictable at times. the game is overcomplicated in certain areas. im forcing myself to play it due to the fact it cost 30 and thats 30 im not prepared to let go for nothing! i just cannot recommend this game at all!!",20.7
"the only reason they still able to sell is that si has no competitors. me is absolute rubbish, unfixed problems from 14 still remain plus new plenty of errors. only real improvement is 3d match.  dumb si will never get my money after this",385.2
"my girlfriend says why this... it i dont have a girlfriend, but i am a successful and rich manager 1000/10",197.3
"another year, same game, same bugs, same problems. they are focusing too much in ui and another things that arent important, whille the me is broken the series died in fm09.",137.4
"not much that i can say other then its crashes everytime i press contiune at the very start of a season. cant even play it after trying everything to get it work which is my why playtime is barely anything",4.2
"i am a long time player of fm and with so many negative reviews i had some hesitations with this title. bought it though on the recent 33% discount offer. so far, i find it better than fm2014. i guess it has been patched because i didnt encounter any of the problems other players are complaining about (useless goal-keepers, lags and craches, lots and lots of injuries, crazy score lines etc). visually speaking, the 3d simulation of the game is in my opinion the best so far for this game, but you should keep in mind this is not fifa. keep in mind though that im not able of saying if the simulation reflects or not the tactical orders given to the players. what i dislike most is the lack of team logos. when you are asking 50 euros for each new installement at least you could get the proper rights to use the real logos.",196.5
"best football manager experience you will ever get. worth every bit of your money",150.6
"watching the matches definately ranks up there in some of the most frustrating things youve ever seen. and the defensive tactics are seriously flawed, was 8th in the prem with newcastle and needed some points on the board. so after going 3-0 to west ham(16th) up i hit up my 4-1-4-1 contain tactic, just to not conceed and see the game out with 3 points(35mins remaining), not in football manager 2015, after making my last 2 subs to suit the new formation i pick up 2 injuries and down to effectivley 9men, then draw 3-3. and that is barely the tip of the iceburg.",128.7
"oh god, i don have a life now, i am doom stuck to this game,,,,",914.5
"ive been playing this game since i was a child and i cant say anything bad and wrong about it. this seasons version, is way more faster than the others, more realistic, and more difficult. which is good. be aware of the gamers saying that is too difficult, the havent understood the beauty of this game at all, yet. if you like football, this is s must have and a must play!",363.6
"this game will make that you will not have life...",312.6
"i can not believe i paid $33 for this crap. 2015 game with such graphics? it is just a game for those who do not want to sit infront of the screen, do some adjustments and click on play, go back to your daily works and chech once in a while. other than that not worth a penny.",484.6
"love this game, not much difference from last year, and my cons are that im liverpool ,beat bayern munich 4-1 had like 20+ shots , beat chelsea 2-1 had 15+ shots played crystal palce my striker missed two sitters -this stiker has finshing of like 19, losted 3-1 there striker score hatrick with finshing of like 13 makes sence, i had 25+ shots they had 5 , 4 on target",156.2
"pros: + the ui improvement + the scouting is more challenging and not auto reveal skills, much more like real life + the game engine improved cons: - i play it too much 9/10",276.2

"look, no game can be perfect. yes there are some issues with the new interface and match engine, but for a simulator such as this, fm is frankly amazing. overall, i have to say that football manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all football fanatics. if you are a past fm player and have been dissapointed with past versions, i honestly beg you to revisit your perspective and try out fm15 (please..)! it is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money. 9/10",105.6
"where to start...its a fantastic game, just like the previous however this one adds a bit more immersion with the team talks. for example i was 1-0 down to hull at halftime with west ham, i drilled into the lads and as it happens with got the equalizer howeer i wanted more, i wanted the 3 points to pursue the league title. i clicked the team talk tab and aggressiely demanded more from the lads and out of nowhere mark noble with a fantastic volley from a corner rattled it home giving me a 2-1 win. at the end of the day if youre an fm fanatic why havent you bought this? and if youre looking for a new challenging strategy game and you have an undying love for football then look no further and purchase this beauty and get into it as i can guarentee you the next one will be better and more advanced!",336.8

"the graphics is great, it more realistic than fm 2014, the engine is great, a lot of cool stuff and great look. but it still like older fm and not quite change a lot. there are still bugs, the most thing that make me hated is the shots. in a match my team scored 18 but 9 on target and 3 goals when they shot 10, 6 on target and 5 goal. and the second thing is injury why is injury happened a lot and crazy like 6-7 months, 3-5 months, 6-7 weeks. but this game is still cool, i really like this game. if you like football and like manage football club, i recommend you to play this!!! for me this game is 7.5/10",45.3

"football manager 2015 does feel like a siginificant improvement from 2014 which respectively wasnt that much different from 2013 or 2012. they added more animations when in game which is cool, but i still dont understand how on my save messi has not won the ballondor for 4 years, he isnt like he is in real life which is strange. whatever still good, you should buy it probably, or dont like i care.",734.4
"ive only put in about 20 hours (not much considering its the fm series) in the beta so far, but i just feel that i have to counter these complaints about the game engine being worse. for the first time since fm09, i feel that the game engine has improved from last year. im not experiencing these random results at all, and the goals that are scored are can almost everytime be traced to a tactical flaw or strength, as opposed to fm14 where that percentage wouldve been about 50. im not experiencing this whole thing with vast amounts of goals being scored/conceded either, nor the comeback issue people have been reporting. i feel like these issues sound like typical beta issues (remember, it is a beta youve been playing) that will be resolved quickly, but will see. either way, im good. corners have been improved, where tactics and player attributes actually make a difference for once, and it is now finally possible to score on free kicks and longshots again (it was of course possible before - but not even the best players in the world would even be close to a realistically decent conversion rate).",25.5

"thank god i only paid 5 for this, prasie the lord for gifts cards!! when playing fm13, i thought that these games were head and shoulders above any other football game in terms of the imersiveness and the elevel of realism. but the last two games since then have been truly discusting. i dont care about the graphics, thats not what the game is about, but the actual realism of the match engine is poor. what is going on with the goalkeepers this year?? about 10-15 of my conceded goals have come directly from rebounds from frankly rediculous saves from the keep, he will just parry the ball away from the most tame shot imaginable and stand there for about a year until the follow up from the opposition striker rolls it in. then he dives. injuries are something which many people are complaining about. i dont feel like my tactical changes have any efect on the game. match stats mean nothing. this is a real shame because i have a lot of time for si but im losing faith by the day. i feel like some things happen on the game just to make you more addicted, becasue lets be honest, its more addictive when your not winnimg, because you cant put the game down until you have sorted it. and why do you have a sudden drop in form ever jan or feb. every team has a bad patch, but i, aloong with many other players have unexplained drops in form where nothing you do can halt the slide. i could go on for hours but i cant be bothered to give anymore feed back because i dont think it makes any differenc so if this review does nothing more than let me take my anger out on it, then so be it",79.0
"instead of getting the core of the game right: tactics, match engine, we get yet another load of new press interactions that nobody cares about and even more dumb talks with players and teams. sure you can get your assistants to do it but some players actually likes talkes to press and staff as long as its not repetitive and actually has an impact? nevertheless the real problem is with the match engine: results like 3 to 5 or 4 to 4 are common, the goalkeeper stays on his line for every cross and the movements the players make in the engine are laughable. the crowd looks like a bunch of inflatable dolls in the stand and just like previous x versions there is hardly any atmosphere in terms of sound from the crowds (where have the good old sack the boss chants gone, or why cant the crowd whistle or boo at the ref?) for that crippled engine we get the amazing gift of hot dog stands outside the stadium? wow, thanks for getting your priorities straight, si. last time i bought the game (since 98/99). time for a decent competitor.",192.8

(not sure how that works.) 2) some errors made by defenders and keepers are simply unexplainable.(not sure if its a bug or not). sometimes the defenders just heads/pass the ball back towards the keeper and then the keeper just stands there making no attempt of clearing it whilst an opposition is running towards it. 3) when players dribble they run into teamates far too often. which is quite unrealistic as it hardly ever happens in real life. 4) this is a very irritating one. players misses 1v1s far too much, if they have 4-5 1v1 chances theyll manage to score one.... this is very unacceptable as in real life players in top leagues simply dont miss all those chances. you could say that they are having a bad game but its happening consistantly throughout the season. also the opposition always manage to score them when they have the chance. but our players just blast it strait at their keepers. 5) final one so far... players some how manages to score some incredible long shots but they simply just blast it over the goal when they are at the 6 yard box which is again unexplainable (sometimes it is harder to miss then to just get it on target). so far i havnt seen a single finesse shot by my players and only 1 from the opposition. please could you fix these issues. i would be forever greatful.",203.2

"i do not like writing about the games i have not completed,but... its rather hard to complete any fm series game. i have already spent some time with the game and i can say, that fm 2015 is good as always - which means perfect. i had some problems to get used to a bit new look of the menus after spending hundreds of hours in the previous edition, but after 5 hours i realized, that it is now even more clear and comfortable. there is no need now to click through three windows to find interesting stats or anything else. the authors added even more tactical features, which make the impression, that you have even greater control of the way the team plays the matches. the graphic got better, though its the least important part and of course the data base is updated adding thousands of new players, managers and more.. its impossible to describe this game shortly and there is no sense in writing poems about it. if you have never played any football manager game and are at least a bit interested in football, then give it a try. and if you have played, then you probably do not any recommendation.",213.2
"more realistic changes on form of a player tha before, plus closer realism on goals with scrambles and imporved grapics with the ball / players reacting as could really happen. watch out for transfer problems like transfer listed and work permit problems. still good stuff, very well researched",434.8
"ive owned cm/fm since the early nineties and would reccomend this edition. its a big improvement on last years edition. match engine is better than its been for a while. football manager classic has also improved and is a welcome break from the full fat edition, a bit like the cm of old that was fast paced. biggest con is still the media press conferences, been in the game for a while now and they are complete crap.",654.7
"ever get excited during a transfer window? ever wanted to build and manage a world class team? look no further, another great tweeked version of fm.",232.9
"first off, i want to say that i was in two minds about getting this game. reviews from the fans didnt seem very positive and as this game has a great community and fan following i was quite shocked. the main criticism has been the frequency of injuries. from what i have seen this is not even true! if anything ive seen fewer injuries than in previous versions. i have been looking closely to see this so called injury problem yet ive never seen more than two key players being injuried at one time and not even for very long! its overall a great and addicting game and my favourite yet if im honest. however, the match engine, although improved, is quite poor and freak goalkeeper mistakes dont seem all that freak anymore as they occur quite a few times each season. however im pretty sure the match engine isnt much to go by (the commentary sometimes says completely different things to what the match engine shows - e.g player shoots really wide but the commenary claims it was almost in) this isnt much of a problem in all honesty and if you had commentary on only you wouldnt ever notice. the new menu layout is really good in my opinion and finding what i want to do is now much easier and quicker making me actually pay more attention to tactics, training and scouting (which i have often ignored to a large extent in previous games) overall id say this game is great and the series is still going strong. so glad i got this game, i would advise you buy it too!",38.6
"i dont know about the negative comments out here, but mine is fine and perfectly run smooth. i love the new match animation, you now can be satisfied when you have player with high technique in your team. love it!",521.9
"multiplayer works flawlessly in my experience playing with 3 friends. everything outside of the match engine is significantly improved over last year. the match engine is worse than ever with odd goalkeepers, lots of injuries and extremely glitchy gameplay. when playing online its really funny to see how awful the stadiums, celebrations and general gameplay is and its still a great rpg. in single player its considerably more frustrating but it makes for some funny stories and there isnt a better alternative. if you want a realistic football/soccer simulation, this isnt it; its not even close. however, you really arent going to do any better and you will still get over 500 hours out of it, if its your kind of thing.",203.4
"great game, perfect fit for football fans. most enjoyed when played with friends.",106.4
"football manager, needs strong rivals, just like a serious football team. while the fm isnt the most innovative and most impressive game around, its still the best football management title. 8/10 would recommend.",13.7
"enjoying the new layout, although its taking a little longer than i expected to adjust. the game does seem to be a bit harder than 2013 and 2014, which is good.",122.9
"how do you know what is the real version an dteh beta, as none of the clubs have any club badges .....",44.7
"while i have loved the fm series since its inception this is the worst version i have played. yes the menu system has been changed and will take a while to get used to ut just feels cluncky, and the scouting system has changed drematically and has problems as i scouted ross barkley managing swansea and got back this player would not be a worth while signing. the worst thing about this game is whatever decideds the score currently i am 15 games into the season and so far the best result for any team away is a draw burnley v chelsea 1-1 all the other matches have been home wins for the respected teams and some strange results q.p.r beating arsnel 6-3 my results away have been awful and at home frakley strange h v everton 5-2 w a v villa 4-0 l a v leicester 7-0 l h v man city 2-1 w h v man utd 1-0 w a v tot 4-2 l h v liverpool 3-0 w a v burnley 2-0 l a v chelsea 8-2 l a v west ham 6-0 l h v arsenal 3-1 w h v west brom 6-2 w a v southhampton 3-1 l h v q.p.r 4-0 w a v sunderland 1-0 l its stupid everyone is near enough on the same popints its coming down to goal difference this has nothing to do with tactics or team moral there is a major bug in the system",230.9

"too complicated for beginners... i think fifa 15 has a better form of football manager",8.2
"regarding a lot of these negeative reviews, i honestly do not know what game people have been playing. the new side bar is a massive improvement to fms accessability. each core page is now much easier to access, freeing up space for a large search bar to instantly find any player, cup or competition in the games database. the new report page is excellent. it is now as clear as it can be what the pros and cons of each player are, making it even easier to scout the perfect player for your team in a given situation. as for the match engine, it keeps getting better and better each year and fm 2015 marks a big step forward with motion capture animations added to the mix. how anyone can play in 2d when the engine quality has improved so dramatically since its implementation is beyond me. fm 2015 is the biggest leap forward in the series for the past 2-3 years.",244.9

"as someone who is not your typical gamer, i never know what to expect from a game, but i thought i would play this as it is a bit different from the rest of my collection.. i was not dissapointed at all. it took me a little while to get used to all the screens, but as i went along i found myself really getting behind my team, and almost shouting at the screen during matches haha. very good, and a wicked time killer.",72.5
"infinitely better than fifa. also i have no life any longer.",619.1
"i havent played fm since the 08 so had a pretty tough beginner time with this one, but after a day everything seems ok now. i am surprised that i havent experienced the injury bug like a lot of people have been talking about in this patch, the game overall was fantastic. the only thing that pissed me off is the 3d match, really hard to tell if the players got tackled or not, sometimes it feels like the other players just purposely tackle ur players (the ones whos about to receive the ball) in the pelnaty area and nothing happens, even the commentary doesnt say anything. the models are just stupid sometimes, they just stand in one place and let the opponents run passed them. the goalkeeper never pick up the ball when they are supposed to, overall a lot of things wrong with the 3d system. hope they will develop in the next game.",111.8
"a lot of people over the years have hated certain new installments of football manager. however, for an addict who has been playing since the first cm came out everything is as beautiful as it should be every year - unless you play with the 3d graphics on, which is absolutely horrid but then again you can never go wrong with 2d. of course, there are some bugs during matches and some inequities but when youre a manager you know that life aint fair. keep on managing till you cry blood when you score with your underdog team against one of the big guys of football and have that mental  when your months of tactical work pays in the end. the best  that has been changed are the ui, scouting and the tactics panel. i absolutely love the new circular star things over the players in the tactics screen. im an fm addict so whatever you give me i will play but those of you who feel the same about it will surely love and play this game anyway. we need that fix yo.",419.7
"terrible, just keeps checking and scanning for updates when i try and click play game then i end up back on this page! tried to uninstall steam and install the game by itself but cannot do this any more. when i could actually play the game i consistently had 5/6 players injured. tried to do too much and ruined the game, needs some patches big toime!",50.3

"not sure what all the negative feedback is about, i think this is a good addition to an aready great series. the new player attribute style is alot better than the old everything greyed out of before, the ability to have your team captain help you with player morale issues etc. the match engine has been fine with me and ive logged 54 hours so far.",249.7

(most games in the high teens or even 20s) and still somehow lose. theres no such thing as consistancy in the game at all (beat athletico madrid with liverpool 3- 0 then subsequently went on to lose to burnley and stoke with same team/tactics for example) i had the same issues with the previous game but thought id give this one a go anyways. i regret my decision massively. 20 down the drain. i wouldnt buy this game again if it was 2. do youself a fabour and avoid this game like the plague.",86.1
"if you have played the others your soon know how addictive these games become, in terms of is it better than 2014? well at first its not simply because of getting used to the new layout but once you master this then yes all the way. better player interaction and match engine, and simply more behind the scenes as well to tweak. the staff on this game have been improved and how you utilise them, while still providing a challenging experience. 10/10",221.7

"football manager 2015 is a manager simulation game which is designed to put you in charge of teams within the footballing world. you can buy/sell as you please as well as hire/fire staff as you please and you ride the highs and lows of football management. if youve played the older versions of this game this game is a slight improvement upon them. this version has added extra features and improvements which most are very much in the background. truth be told the same issues with the preivous versions still exist in this version to a certain extent, such as the ai (at times in rare cases) is very frustrating and downright poor. ai issues have been adressed in the latest update, but much like many other games the orignal version was released unfinished/unpolished. much like the fifa franchise this game slightly improves elements such as graphics and adding one or two features which in my opinon is unacceptable there is alot of potentail and the creators should look to improve much more (such as the match engine and overall media/player interaction). to be more positive the game is fun, challengeing and does feel like an improvement the match engine is getting better and the accuracy of transfers between clubs is better, however the next version must have significant improvement in order to prevent the franchise from becoming stale. for football fans who enjoy the small details involed with football and would ratrher be at the helm of a club rather than a player this game is for you. overall an addictive game and a slight improvement and a solid edtion to a franchise with high potential. 6/10 (upon release) 8.5/10 (latest update).",258.3

"the most frustrating fm ever. can batter teams and still lose. have a 3 goal lead, winning easily and then somehow draw. im afraid its all too predictable. for example, was getting beat at home 3-1 by spurs. clawed it back to 3 a piece but i knew it was going to let them score a winner in the 90th minute and it did. really unimpressed and wish i never bothered buying it. if youre thinking about buying it stick with fm2014 because this version is piss poor.",78.6

"worst fm ever , even 2013 was way better , so a patch ago , everyone was marking over 4-5 goals per game. they fixed it ok , i can wait a bit , now new patch . every free kick = goal , every corner = goal . you dominate all the game and lose vs a corner/freekick. their goalkeeper is a freaking ninja , yours sucks , attributes dont matter regarding the goalkeeper. aguero from man city is a beast , he can mark goals from every position , ive played countless times vs man city , apparently aguero never misses ( i do not expect to win vs city, but i do not expect to get a goal from every aguero ball touch, yes i did marked him and asked my defenders to break his legs) . this game killed my nerves , i used to play fm 14 for countless hours and not with big teams, i was struggling my way up. here if you play vs a big team , regardless of your tactics , you will concede at least 3-4 goals. another bug chelsea has the line throw ups like they are corners, if the opposition player has better stats, your defender will not even try getting the ball, cause that player is imba, your defenders will just watch him go around , not even try to get the ball, at least seeing them try and fail would do, not just seeing them trying to stare the ball out of the opposition. else what can i say ? this game is not worth buying or playing, unless of course you wait 20 patches so they can fix every issue , cause they dont have beta testers or if they have , those guys are . this game was a waste of money/time.",34.5
"interface lag ruins it for me. also, sometimes i feel as if ive been fifaed with the whole 35 shots, 19 on target for your team against 3 shots 1 on target and you lose 1-0 or my personal favorite, 35 shots, 19 on target for your team and 2 shots, 2 on target for the opposition and you lose 2-1. alot of really enjoyable aspects to the game including the engine. still rather hoping for further upgrades in that department. the sim aspect is wonderful though.",385.4
"i want to play this game. i like fantasy games. but everytime i start it up, i remember that half my team will be injured within the first 3 months. that no matter what i do consistency is not possible and my team will fail to perform and i will fail to have any real impact on that despite the rediculas sometimes over lapping micro-managing aspects that are both too specific and too general. example... exploit the flanks doesnt mean exploit the flanks more, it means only exploit the flanks unless you select other options. in which that ratio cant be controlled. example... you can have multiple coaches for multiple traits and skills but can only have one practice type per day. you can try to teach a player a new move or position; and its up to the player if hes compatable let alone compitent. you will train and trade and chances are players wont want to come to your club in which case the conversational options are minimal repetative and non-impactful. oh and did i mention that some of the user interface is completely bugged? and i mean completely! try organizing your custom view and watch as some of your options *do not appear*. you want to sort by position; sure, wait then why does it sort by ability when i click position? to suggest this game would be to encourage this type of lack luster game developing that is become the norm. im not saying you cant make money, but just publish a game every other year and charge us 100$ for something you can be proud of. instead of dusting off and polishing the same game with improved data.",135.3

"having played many of the footall manager games in the past, i admit i became bored of the same layout, things to do etc.... fm15 is really enjoyable and has re-ignited my love for this genre. i love the way it is no too deep, that it bores the pants of you, but also love it, because it has everything that you need from a fm game. the choices you make both to the media, players alike all have repecussions, and i have to say it is quite realistic with the in match options too. hats off for fm15 for a good game. only cons i have is the lack of premier league clubs badges and players faces etc, but i suppose that is to do with the licensing laws.......... would recommend.......now for the league",10.7
"1) lack of leagues 2) no option to create your own custom club. its funny but in fm2012 such option is available. ive just lost my money buying such <censored>.",7.6
"sucks monkey balls. cheats you worse than ever. you could have the best team in the world, be leading 3-1 in a cl game but fm decides that youre to be spanked 6 or 7 goals in the return leg. dont waste your money and go spend it on a game that actually gives you what a game is supposed to. enjoyment.",345.8
"poor effort from si games. to many bugs & glitches. game gets worse after every patch.",346.3
