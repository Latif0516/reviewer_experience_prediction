"although the most challenging of the series so far, more because of the new adaption to the layout and the scouting methods. for me its a big improvement on user interface but the harsh amount of injuries it makes progression a longer task where you have to put mild detail into the smaller things instead of throwing it to your below par am. i suggest it if you put a good amount of time into the later games but for a newbie 13/14 would be a safer choice in the way of enjoyment of the game and winning things.",63.0
"i would heavily reccomend this years version of football manager. in my opinon it is quite a bit better than last years version. the bugs in the match engine have been fixed and it plays better than ever. the new ui is nice and slick, very useable and saves me a lot of time. the biggest improvement is the scouting system though, its much more dynamic and genuinley interesting compared to before.",482.4
"love this game and i have loved the games before it, real difference this year and i personally feel like it has improved leaps and bounds!! well done sega and the fm team!",197.6
"an important public service announcement: do not, i repeat do not, buy this ing piece of utter horse , under any, i repeat any, circumstances. the match engine is ed beyond all recognition. it will drive you insane thinking that the game is scripted, but it honestly is not. it is just so ineptly designed that even now, after years of releasing these games, defenders will still trap the ball, then run away from it, allowing the opposition free goals. why is this happening? laziness and complacency on the part of the developers. do not spend your money on this ing shithouse unless you feel justified in feeding their evil empire. i found out the hard way. you have been warned.",37.4
"this game deserves the nobel prize! well, it should deserves a big awards of some sort. the main reason is because of its compelling nature, no one will be able to hop off the fm15 train once they have set foot in. as a big football fan, it is an honour that i get to play and experience one of the most intricated and dedicated football simulation ever. so please if you are ever wondering what to do on a wet and stormy tuesday night, the best solution is to immerse yourself into what is known as fm15.",523.8
"i would 100% recormend this game to anyone that likes gamemodes like career mode on fifa 15 but football manager goes into fare more depth and more teams and player even though the graphic arnt great the game makes it back with many fetures that they offer. this year it is made easyer to navigate the menu. the best new feature is when setting up a new carear you change your past history from a no body to a ex-world class player.",259.2
"shitest game ever , cant even open game seriously crash files with shitest support in community.sigames every thread not solve my problem even ftp i must install filezilla and upload by myself . i never seen this before.",0.5
"unrealistic results, lots of goals scored, silly goalkeepers. buy this game!",111.0
"please release a game that works; you spend each year just updating - then charge us for it; stop taking our money for v. minor changes! other games would be laughed at. a few shocking points. - gks fly like reflexes? its insane! - no ones ever fit? - goal shy stirkers? - refs that never give fouls, ever! one of my players was hacked 4 times in the box in the same move. even the most free willing ref would crumble to that! not that we can see anyway because the graphic are so rubbish! - man utd never lose? - players just standing there with the ball turning in the spot? a year and you give us this, wow?? - wing backs that run past someone (overlap) then slow down to be overtaken again by defenders!? - the whole game runs v.slow. general animation is wack for the where were at in the world. - one (more) year and you offer us graphics and animation this bad? there not even an animation for shielding the ball! build a game on tactics, not buying a bunch of star players. and after all these years youve still not sorted training out lol, this is where teams build there style of play!! wow its good game but it very bad too!",287.2
"a good game but has a few issues (e.g. clean sheets). takes a bit of time to get used to the new layout. overall a worthwhile buy but if you have football manager 2014 it may be worthwhile to wait until football manager 2016 is released.",317.5
"steam workshop is rubbish. sub to a mod and it doesnt even show up in my downloads",8.8
"i love it... but then again i love the tactical and the behind the scenes running of a football club and obviously it is one of, if not the, the best football managerment simulator on the market. i have seen a lot of people complaining about bugs but in general i rarely get the bugs that people get in games, on computer and console. i havent had a problem with it yet after 52 hrs played. there are features it could add to further improve it but still great game that can still improve. only thing i could think of as a problem would be some of the unrealistic scorelines( i beat liverpool 7-1 on the opening day as man united and as much as i hate liverpool i dont think they should be getting beat 7-1 especially when i hadnt even a full strenght team out).",913.7
"i have one word for this review and that word is ... b3a5t",205.0
"i was losing all games with ac milan, could not get my head around it. tried several tactics, changed focus and training, talked to players, motivated them, took care of shape and condition. zero goals, almost all losses. i took over the weakest team to play against myself, asked my assistant about starting 11, set no tacticts, gave no orders, ignored everything and i won against ac milan 4-2! this makes no sense at all. and all goals are from crosses! and jeez, too many injuries!",22.6
"played 2 hours. about to play my first game when the game quit unexpectedly...",42.7
"the new interface is great. also new features looks awesome.",180.8
"awesome game, never fails to impove year in year out",560.5
"i really want to like this game, but i just cant! was a waste of 30 if im honest. ridiculous scorelines, too many injuries, the referees are far to card happy and they constantly give stupid penalties. the match engine is rubbish and abit predictable at times. the game is overcomplicated in certain areas. im forcing myself to play it due to the fact it cost 30 and thats 30 im not prepared to let go for nothing! i just cannot recommend this game at all!!",20.7
"terrible ! black patches on screen even after update. played on cause i love the fms but the whole feel of it is poor. frustrating as hell !",209.6
"i dont know what people are crying about. i havent noticed any problems with the injuries and ive started several saves both in top and bottom tier football. overall this is by far the best football manager thats released to date althought theres still a few bugs here and there like theres pretty much every year. by the january update the game will most likely be pretty much a bug free, which is when most people buy the game anyway. the new match engine is very promising and i think its already better than in the previous versions. the new touchline team talks also seems to be working pretty well and the add another dimension to the game. the new scouting system is also superior compared to the previous versions. and then the new ui... its again way better than before and having the side panel back just makes its so much easier to navigate through the menus. so overall i think its the best football manager game to date, although it still have a few bugs here and there. if you are a fan of the football manager franchise then this is definitely a must buy. remember that the christmas sales are coming soon so its probably worth waiting till then if you havent got the game already by now. and this was written by someone who spents 1000-1500 hours with football manager each year and i own each and every game of the serie including quite a few versions of cm too.",868.5
"brilliant game just need some people to do online with now who can say they play between 5-6 and then not come back on for about 2 weeks -_-",127.9
"absolutely awful game. it makes no difference who you play, who you sign, or how you play, you will end up having a ridiculous amount of shots on/off target. (most games in the high teens or even 20s) and still somehow lose. theres no such thing as consistancy in the game at all (beat athletico madrid with liverpool 3- 0 then subsequently went on to lose to burnley and stoke with same team/tactics for example) i had the same issues with the previous game but thought id give this one a go anyways. i regret my decision massively. 20 down the drain. i wouldnt buy this game again if it was 2. do youself a fabour and avoid this game like the plague.",86.1
"i just bought this game, and it does not work, on my mac, the game looks really old, the screen is black everywhere, every second line, has this black shadow, and when i touch it, it shows. when i remove the mouse, it gets all black again.. anyone, knows how to fix that???",5.9
"i cant recommend this in its current state. too many injuries and a poor match engine with either unlikely goals or very lopsided results or where you can have all the best players, be accomplished in all your tatics and have 100% motivation and still lose to the same team because the match engine decides you have to lose even though you have better possession, attack and a whole bunch of players. i had one game where the opposition went in and stoked it up and i had 9 injuries as a result with the opposition having no yellow cards. the match engine seems not to reward those who attempt to play possession based soccer and it seems a case of just learning the same couple of tatics and rotating them or changing from control to attacking and you can win way too easily (unless the game refuses to let you win against one team...) buying and selling players well a lot of the decent youth players the opposition wants in excess of 90 million pounds for. went back to 2012 and had more fun then i did with fm15, after one season on 15 im out, mabye after feb it will be better but for now i cant be stuffed.",78.7
"so many injuries in just 3 weeks (got like 9 injured players).. id prefer 2014 & 2013",9.1
"getting better and better every year. good interface with reasonable match-engine.",245.9
"put simply, this game is simply not worth buying in its present state. needs a huge overhaul of gameplay mechanics. when spending a good deal of money for a new game, you expect it to be in a playable state.",7.0
"1) lack of leagues 2) no option to create your own custom club. its funny but in fm2012 such option is available. ive just lost my money buying such <censored>.",7.6
"game is great, yeah you will get pissed often, players will run like  but eventually you will realize it is realistic. it gives you so much, interface is amazing but ai sucks. sometimes ball gets through the players (not in my case! when i shoot they block, when they shoot it goes through me!), players with mertesacker pace run faster than bolt but still... it provides amazing experience. it is not really a game you would play all the time, but when you are bored (no hard feelings towards fm addicters). it is overpriced, it is not worth 50, but i bought it on sale for 33 and i am delighted.",59.3
"i was really looking forward to playing football manager 2015 on pc, as ive always experienced only hanheld version. the difference in accuracy and particulars between the two is immediatly noticeable. there are two main modalities: a simplified one (closer to handheld versions) and a full-simulation one (suggested to expert fm gamers). according to me the game in both modalitites is quite difficult, furthermore im really concerned with the fact that i cant find a suitable tactic for my team. managers functions are completely outstanding, as the give you a wide range of possibilities, and in genereal they seem to be close to reality. in general the game is really entartaining and amazing, with nice 3d graphis, that enhance the whole simulation effect. in general the game is very nice.",90.3
"how do you know what is the real version an dteh beta, as none of the clubs have any club badges .....",44.7
"i have really been let down by this years verison of football manager. i just can not get around the new interface and it is making it hard to get inticed into the game. when i start my first season, a number of players get unsettled straight away. for example i have just started as fulham and moussa dembele is an 18 year old striker and is interested in moving straight away, i just do not understand these aspects at all. overall i believe si need to make greater improvements to their game.",69.6
"im a big fan of fm games but last few years seems your main enemy is injuries, this version ive been getting 1-2 a game, they start to add up. also why do so many games have huge scorelines like its the norm now, i dont lose often but when i do its by 4-5 goals, this seriously needs sorted out, because im not playing till this and injuries are fixed. i appreciate alot of stuff like updating stats every year that people dont realize how long it takes but still these are fundamentals that can break the whole experience. like i said i do love these games but its just not worth it this year, nothing new that makes it worth another purchase. i prefer to use 2014 and get updates for it.",367.6
"this game is addictive,if you love soccer and managing a team/country then you should definitely buy this game.",127.7
"always love the football manager series and like the new features on fm 15. alot have complained about the match engine but with the latest update and a tweak of your tactics you can games with no issue. maybe some have an issue with only using one tactic for every match which is never going to work given the improved ai.",349.3
"good game , its real i playing using manchester united team and half team is injury .................. thanks for the update , now this game so perfect.......... 10/10",163.5
"unfortunately the makers of fm have not learnt from their mistakes last time. they have yet again released a game with so many bugs there is no point buying the game until around february when all the patches have been released to correct the bugs. the testing process before the game is issued is terrible - is there actually one at all?. this could be such a good game, but is really bad. and they insist on players using this ridiculous steam platform to run the game through. hate it.",9.9
"the fixes have been excellent, and fm 15 is a fantastic game",681.7
"pretty good so far. i have been a devotee since fm 2010 and buy this every year. i never really got into fm 2014 but so far i am liking fm 2015. the high score line games is a bit of a bug but it is being worked on so i dont doubt soon enough games will revert to more sensible score lines. the new interface is really good and very easy to navigate and the overall appearance of the game is attractive. at this point it still is a little buggy but i would think in due course it will be sorted out and will be a solid addition to the fm line up.",71.7
"the most unrealistic simulation game ive ever played, where your every move has zero affect on the outcome. if you are a chelsea fan this is the game for you - they have gone totally unbeaten after season one and conceeded only 10 goals. yeah so thanks for the super realistic engine fm",56.1
"i dont know why so many people have been complaining. it feels the same as last years game but with slightly better graphics and a more organized, nicer menu/interface. if you enjoy football, pick it up in the sale!",77.0
"im not even able to play the damn game now? horrific glitches throughout the game to begin with and now maybe a week after buying it im not even able to play the game. i click play now and nothing happens? sort it out.",153.3
"great game. to all you complaining about it, you just need to perfect your tactics instead of expecting to win every single game from the word go. loving everything about it!",359.7
"-too many injury issues.its been nearly 5 months after released and still nothing changed about injury problems. -lots of ridiculous interview questions.(ive a cup game with a upper league team and they show me cup favorite and ask about lack of dicipline ! wtf ) -you cant have a interaction with a player or a manager without a reason.(like training performance or form of player and you cant make a comment about a manager in many situations). -promises: causes trouble.(i promised a rotation player for get a first team chance,after this he played sixteen of twenty game and blaimed me for didnt keep my word) -transfer politics: all my rivals make stupid transfers,lose their power year by year and it makes me win easier leauge and local cups .no challange after 2-3 years.not realistic !! -board:when election comes ; there is no chance of winning election the president who already in charge.even he succeed to win cups and league challenge. -unrealistic transfer prices for young talents.( 7m -20m  for an average talent .if were talkin about wonderkid 25m -75m  wtf!!! ) .. some problems i remembered.there are many of them.i corncerned about their company politics  release and let alone community at least they have enough time for solving this issues. we need update! p.s: sorry for my grammar,i hope i was clear.",460.3
"i need help about my orders about transfer budget. i bought with credit card but i dont know how to load it. please help me",181.6
"if you try to be k. rajagopal, play this game. if you try to be van gaal, play this game. if you try to be hasbullah awang, play this game. if u want to be like najib razak, give br1m. i dont need sex because fm15 s me all the time.. 9/10 recomended.. buy this game or i will cut your ***k!",188.8
"i have been reading through the reviews for this game, yet i cant understand how people have said how rubbish they thing this new release is? of course its going to have some bugs/faults/issues with the game as soon as it comes out, just like any other pc game you buy, none are perfect as soon as theyre released due to companies being pushed to release their games quicker so that they ensure they make a fast profit. you just need to be patient, like i was. once the bugs were fixed and it was all how it was supposed to be, this is a really good game. probably the best one out of the fm series yet, due to you have to actually scout and search for certain player that you want/need. instead of their being a huge list of transfer listed players available, so its hit and miss on whether you get bargains or you end paying the full price. which is extrememly realistic. the 3d graphics have been improved making it more realistic on the pitch especially with the new team talk feature allowing you to shour specific instructions to your team. the only downside is that sega have yet again tried and failed with the media, i started of as a conference north team (chorley fc) yet i have press conferences before and after every game. surely a team that has only just made it to the conference north, shouldnt be having this many press conferences/tunnel interviews if they havent even been fully estabilished by anyone hardly? it just makes it seem like they havent put much thought into the media. overall i am pretty much on this game all the time now, its extrememly addicting, i would advice anyone to purchase this. plus 30 for a pc game is nothing these days? bargain.",98.3
"all the thumbs down are from bad managers with rubbish tactics.",32.1
"sick game bar the inconsistency of the teams apart from that so realistic and quality",135.0
"warning: do not buy this game. ive been a loyal fan of fm for almost a decade now. this is by far the worst fm ever produced. loading the menu screen is slow, network games have become intollerable because of the lag, and the injuries have become so frequent that it borders on the absurd. they had one job to do all year since the last fm, which was to update the squads and update the scouting stats. now im angry at valve for having a no refund policy.",38.7
"quite a few glitches but thats because im playing the alpha version. looks like its going to be another succesful instalment to the series!",380.0
"i found the 2015 version to be so much better than the previous years. get it.",189.9
"i have to play game 5x to win even though i had 50 compared to their 2-3 shots.i understand not having luck but this is ridiculous.its made to get u pissed off.if you want to keep your nerves dont buy it.i am playing manager since season 2002 and seeing direction they are taking it i will never buy it again.",531.2
"i want to play this game. i like fantasy games. but everytime i start it up, i remember that half my team will be injured within the first 3 months. that no matter what i do consistency is not possible and my team will fail to perform and i will fail to have any real impact on that despite the rediculas sometimes over lapping micro-managing aspects that are both too specific and too general. example... exploit the flanks doesnt mean exploit the flanks more, it means only exploit the flanks unless you select other options. in which that ratio cant be controlled. example... you can have multiple coaches for multiple traits and skills but can only have one practice type per day. you can try to teach a player a new move or position; and its up to the player if hes compatable let alone compitent. you will train and trade and chances are players wont want to come to your club in which case the conversational options are minimal repetative and non-impactful. oh and did i mention that some of the user interface is completely bugged? and i mean completely! try organizing your custom view and watch as some of your options *do not appear*. you want to sort by position; sure, wait then why does it sort by ability when i click position? to suggest this game would be to encourage this type of lack luster game developing that is become the norm. im not saying you cant make money, but just publish a game every other year and charge us 100$ for something you can be proud of. instead of dusting off and polishing the same game with improved data.",135.3
"great game with amazing detail, hard to learn how to play well but a season as a manager should solve that.",20.9
"played football manager since its inception in 84 on the zx spectrum, this is one of the worst in the series for multiple reasons. the devs seem to have the notion of more is constantly better whilst getting the fundamentals of the game which always stood it above the rest completely wrong. i have thousands of hours in football manager games and never been compelled to write a negative review. although playable is not great, the series has gone downhill the last few years in my opinion.",117.7
"love this game.. very entertaining so far.. rarely i got crash on this game, fix it please",121.0
"the game does not work! the game crashes everytime i try to start a game",1.2
"no problems with the game. really good setup and layout.",177.2
"i so wanted it to be different! having spent 1000s of hours playing cm/fm since 1996 i gave up in 2013 after getting so frustrated with rapidly dropping morale and crazy results. for two years i sat on the side lines and didnt buy fm, secretly hoping i would be able to come back one day and rekindle the joy the game had brought me for so many years. this year i decided to give it another go, desperately hoping for the same enjoyable and consistent expierence. sadly all enjoyment has been sucked from the game! all i found was random results (i had pens in 4 out of 5 games), crazy dips in morale when and shocking injury rates. everything i loved about it seems to have gone.... like i said at the start i gave up two years ago, after this ive given up for good. si thank you for so many ours of enjoyment, i hope you turn things around as id be sad to see the title continue to fade.",10.1
"sports interactive have really made a mess of this game. if you dont want to have a stroke because burnley are playing like real madrid and your keeper parries the ball to opposition feet then avoid buying it. far too many injuries leaving you to play with your worst players, tactics you set seem to be ignored. players are too easily offended. if ......and its a big if you get things going your way youll soon be slapped back down again by overall poor performances or injuries. awful. players also moan too much about game time which puts everyone on their period and you have to walk on egg shells. my god if i could swear on this i would. i have an alienware pc and with fm14 i could set the graphics to highest settings and it would play smoothly all day long, this pc eats up the system requirements and asks for seconds but on fm15 (exactly the same requirements) i have to leave it on medium otherwise the match engine struggles! ive loved all the fms and it rarely disappoints but fm15 has really let me down. angry with it in fact. extremely disappointed with it. ill return to fm14 to allow my blood to come off the boil and simmer",376.0
"certainly one of the more difficult games in the series, but easy enough to master after a while. ive always been a fan of the championship manager/football manager games, and i cant see that changing any time soon.",345.4
"it all comes together after years of being a wierd disjointed experience.",253.9
"got the game on saturday, lost about 17 hours in these past three days to the game. abandoned all social obligations trying to get leeds united to the premier league. currently sitting comfortably in 8th place in the championship at around january. havent been this addicted to an fm like this before. i wont stop until i get leeds up or i get sacked. 10/10 feeling sleep deprived, yet slighlty content with my efforts in the game. liam marching on together",24.8
"in spite of what people have said, i would say this is a very intuitive and interesting addition to the series.",206.1
"its another year and another football manager game. i will play it for countless hours again because i am addicted to this sort of game and i play fm because frankly, there is no alternative. does this mean i will either recommend it or give it a good review? once again, not this year. the lack of ability in si to actually listen to the reviews of its customers is just awful. this is a company that has been excellent in the past at implementing user ideas. in the past few season such bugs as far too many injuries (they argue there are fewer than real life, blah, blah) and goal keepers who just let the ball in after catching it have been glaring issues, just to name two examples but i could go on like this for hours with things they just choose to ignore or tell us are not issues at all. the new user interface is just trash, especially the tactics screen and this does not seem to be getting addressed despite cries from the user base, once again. i dont really need to write a long list of things wrong with this game, just quickly browsing the review section here will show you what is sorely missing and what is over looked. i want to love fm again, but it looks like they are just making too much money and only listening the fan boys on their main forums to care about the user base anymore.",526.4
"there arent much changes from 13, i didnt purchase 14 because i knew there wasnt gonna be some huge updates and changes. sigames merely refined the game and touched up on some areas in 2015. they tried to shift the reliance of fmscout(genie) by allowing us to scout for potential and consistency of players. but, the scouting ui system is terrible... imagine scouting over 200-300+ players, and after the initials reports those players who didnt make the cut, you will have to remove them one by one manually.... genie is still the choice for me, its just too convenient... it was refreshing for maybe the first few days, after that you will realise its actually the same old thing being repackage with some minor tweaks and improvements. buy it if you are a real diehard football or fm fan, if not just stick to your 13/14.",289.4
"do we even need a goalkeeper in our team? it seems that we dont. because it doesnt make much difference if we had one in our team - we will still concede silly goals anyway. the match engine is rubbish. the worse fm i have ever played.",252.3
"issue for me these days with fm is the staleness of the whole experience. there are things wrong with the match engine as others have pointed out, but the whole series has emphasised width over depth since it moved from being cm to fm - ive been playing since domark versions on the amiga. i remember when we only had text based commentary and the tension was incredible, there was the feeling of just being given enough information and let your imagination fill in the gaps. fm2015 in particular gives you so many features it can initially feel overwhelming, until that is, you realise it doesnt really matter. keep your players happy, make sure your tactics are reasonably sane, gradually improve your squad, and well thats it... obviously, you can complicate that as much as you like if thats what you want, but the whole game experience is totally flat now. every iteration just adds a couple more features that arent really fleshed out much on top of a bunch of features from previous iterations that havent been developed further once they have been introduced. all we seem to really pay 40 (assuming you buy on release) for is a data update and a quick polish - it makes no difference if the dev team have put thousands of hours into each version if the end-users experience is so stale - its lost sight of the end-user experience, and thats what hurts so much. the adding of in-game purchases is also a massive turn-off for me (and others who have given up on fm sooner than i inevitably will); seriously, micro-payment to increase your clubs bank balance? buy editor access? purchase no transfer restrictions? whose idea was this? its awful.",209.8
"well its obviously much improved from last year fm edition, improved gui which need sometime to navigate through much improved scouting, etc that was exciting but of course, it can still improve for the upcoming weeks",104.3
"fantastic management game indepth players club attributes ive played every football manager game and every year they get better,great game engine,tho i dont use it i like to play with 2d classic mode,thousands of players to scout from around the globe,just a few glitches there are a few bugs that need fixing,but this does not affect the gameplay in anyway,overall id give it 8.5 out of 10, fantastic footy management game,a must for the any football fan,please note,say goodbye to your freinds and family as you wont want to stop playing!",570.0
"not the best verion of fm but certainly not the worst. yes there are bugs and irritations but still playable.",412.8
"im having a love-hate relationship with this version of the game. theres some stuff to love, and a bit more to hate. but heres the main points: pros: +switching between two teams when managing a club and country is easier +considerably more realistic +sidebar, and game in general, is neat. everything is tidy, easy to look at, easy to find cons: -the team selection screen is so, so clunky -3d match engine is still awful. i still play on 2d because i cannot deal with the mistakes that will happen on 3d, like defenders passing in to their own net far more regularly than irl",168.2
"honestly, ive been purchasing this game for 9 years now and honestly i dont understand why players are never fit. several of my players even the non-injury prone players seem to repeatedly die on the pitch. united seem to be able to be in the relegation and still win champions league i mean honestly utter crap too many offside goals and star ratings arent realistic",671.9
"cant even launch the game, played it yesterday after buying it in the shop now i cant even play the game because it just takes me to this stupid stream site instead of just loading the game!!!!!",19.5
"not as good as previous years. the layout is not simple, illogical format in certain situations. but, still love the concept of the game, and so always play it; but the previous years are much better!",230.6
"if you are a fan of football, youll need to play this!",20.3
"tip: if you are unable to win what seems like a winnable game, vacation for one day.",214.8
"i didnt like the game at all i cant even play it the colors of the background really hurt my eyes i cant look more than 10 mins. i played football manager 13 before and that was much better than this. background is fully black and all the other lively colors make it hard to read. and you cant personalize this. you cant see the additional packs bought in the game. i am really frustrated. i cant see the full pitch while playing in 2d mode. i can not search for players after 2 transfers. what is wrong this year?",154.4
"there just werent enough changes for me. one thing i wouldve liked to have seen is the ability to practise set pieces. on the last fm i used to concede from corners a lot. i wouldve liked the opportunity to set up a defence vs attack scenario and seen how it played out and then tweaked my instructions based on that. apart from the skin and the tracksuit manager element from what i can see from the beta is that nothing much has changed. i appreciate that you dont want to mess with the format too much but there is scant reason to get excited about this update.",225.4
"dont understand why i have to login in to steam servers to play a game i have bought and played numerous times already. so frustrating to not be able to play my game because your servers cannot cope!!!!!",228.3

"unsure on which way to swing with this game, its good but so broke, in saying that though 14 was broke up until january. what annoys me about this game is how awful your goalkeeper becomes when your 1-0 up with 10 mins left, the amount of games ive drew or lost being 1-0 up with 10 mins left is unreal. but because i have faith in si id say buy it but when its in a sale or something cause 30 is far too much for a game that is still broken",145.5

"there is certainly a lot more going on in this years iteration of fm - certain elements have been changed massively from the fm14 look, whilst some have received only a mild tweaking. this tends to be the case nearly every year and dont always result in an improved product the changes made this year have largely been pleasing, although in particular i am not a fan of the new tactics board. it seems like the information i need is still there but it is hidden behind extra menus and mouse clicks, generally creating what feels to me like an inefficient system when compared to fm14. the gameplay has remained largely the same and is familiar to anyone who has spent time with the series. the engine seems to have been improved in some areas and regressed in others, again mirroring previous versions of the game. there seem to be more goals going in, more goals from crosses and set pieces, and more defensive errors. the game also seems harder and learns an inflexible managers tactics rather quickly. i only use the 2d classic view so cant comment on the 3d match engine, i have never used it or had any interest in it. fundamentally, its still great fun to build and develop a team, to argue with other managers and to lead your club to glory or glourious defeat. i would definitely recommend this to anyone with more than a passing interest in the franchise and it represents a solid return on investment in terms of new features and gameplay hours.",253.5

"first of, i have to say that i love the fm series, with over 180 hours in fm2012, near 200 in fm2013 and near 400 hours in fm14. i started the game as manchester united and played my first season being crowned champions i believe i have an idea about the game, so here are some pros and cons: --pros-- the interface (takes a while to get use to) is great better game engine (animations and such) new ways to transfer players (talking them into it etc.) scouting makes sense game created youngsters are good potential view is better at scouting --cons-- its hard to sell players talking to the chairmen got harder wonderkids level up in a long time --update #2-- since the game came out i changed the review. 9/10",188.1
"much better interface than fm14,ontop of this the new mocap they put in the game adds a nice layer to the game not present in 14. for veterans of the game series theres just as much tatical depth and choice making as before whereas for begininers there are handy tutoriuls as well as a bountiful amount of fan create gudies and such. i would recommened this game to anybody with time on thier hands",304.0

"errrmaaagerrrrd!!! i get like this every season, but, what the hell have they done to the gui!!! its horrible!!!!! also, whats going on with the skin ? and the contrast ?!?!? the pitches are a bright/painful to look at green and the rest of the game is dull and grey!! i go from pre match into the game and have to wear ray bans so i dont go blind! im praying its just beta issues, but they are basic things!!! sort it out si!!! ;)",473.5
"ive picked up fm 2015 after 5 years abstinence and im hooked again. match engine has improved since the release with each patch, but again there is still room for improvement. every new patch states that keeper reactions are fixed but i still fear every shot on goal and slow keeper reactions after the save. everyone is complaining about tactical incosistency, how you can beat real madrid and loose next match against a lower league team, but its good to change up your formation and tactics from time to time. for me at least it is something that i like and keeps me playing. ui is useful and easy to learn. overall game speed is ok, im usualy playing with 7-8 different nation leagues and didnt experience any lag. i have no complaints on training and youth development. i dont like high transfer values and money spent for weekly/monthly wages but then again thats how it works in reality. does it have that addiction spice in the whole mix? yes it does, at least for me it has :). ive been playing fm (old cm) since i was 13 years old and now im 35 :). is it worth 50 euros? no, it certainly is not. but then again i didnt have any problem spending that ammount of money, because i want to support developers for making one of my favourite games :).",451.7

"i shall try keep this brief as this is making me miss more time in game, i have only played this version and its predecessor, fm 14 was a great game in its own right and not many improvments needed to be done, in my opinion, then i strarted fm 15, straight away you can see the changes esp with the new and improved interface, it does take a little time getting used to but it is alot more in depth, the tactics page, you have alot more options on this giving players more options on how to play, one of the major flaws however in this years edt of the game which i hope they fix with a patch, is how many players get injured in a season, it feels more of an action game that could rival max payne games, my squad lost 3 keepers for 4 months all due to the same injury at around the same time, that is also not to mention all the other injuries i suffered thru the season, i also played an internation competion as england and somehow managed to beat germany 8 - 2, as much as i loved the sore line to the game and i buzzed for a while, in reality this is not possible, overall the game is very addictive and if youre into these kind of games, a must buy",62.3
"i only recently started playing football manager again when i bought 2014 and oh boy, is it still addictive. play fm 2015 with caution, you will be staying up all night and day to see your team win the third division and you will celebrate like you won the champions league before collapsing in exhaustion as if you had just physically played a whole season of football yourself.",109.2

"dont be put off by all the helpful negative reviews, they were made when it was still in beta/just after beta. the game is very good, and i have found it to be the most enjoyable game yet. the 3d match engine has been slightly imporved (players do skills, back heels), and the layout is just aesthetically pleasing.",291.5
"football manager 2015 is the best version yet of the greatest football management game on earth. it takes you deeper than ever into the world of football management and is extremely addictive. the best feature is the 3d match view allowing you to see your players on the pitch actually score goals. keep up the good work sports interactive, and lets hope the 2016 version is even biggedr and better.",603.8
"literally any interface feature you can think of from fm2014 got screwed up. search function is incredibly laggy, and slow and makes it unable to use. lots of options that i frequently use are now many more clicks away. the new interface is just not practical, have to click so many times and feels so much slower to play than the 2014 version. im not gonna get myself any more annoyed by the stupid design of this game. for someone who spent hundreds of hours having fun with the 2010-2014 versions of the game, i wont even play this version more than the 10hrs i did untill now, unless they make a decent interface like in fm 2014. si, you just lost a fm-fan. also i had to wait for a few updates and change the game preferences to make it even playable at all, weeks after purchase. goodbye 50 for !",11.0

"really dont understand how the me gets worse. 2012 was ok, just needing a bit of tweaking. 2013 onwards have been shocking, with the latest being the worst. i fully understand that fm is a management simulator, and that si will say it isnt meant to be fifaesque in terms of graphics etc., but that isnt my gripe. the major issue i have with the me is what you see happening in no way relates to your instructions or the stats at the end. for example, you concede too many from balls over the top, so you set the team to defend deeper. but when you are viewing the match, the back four are still in the halfway line. what is the point in having the facility to change something if the me doesnt reflect that change? same with ratings; a keeper drops one into his own net then kicks a ball stright to the opposition to score. his rating is a 7. from what i see, he is at fault for two goals, yet if i discipline or drop him, he thinks its unwarranted as the stats say he played well. nothing you see happening relates to stats. some of the interplay is laughable. world class players look like baby deer trying to kick a ball and the decision making completely at odds with what players (especially good ones) would do in those situations. only real benefit of th game its updated database. aside from that its a poor imitation of previous versions. save your money",136.7

"having played many fm games over the years, i didnt think that the match end could become more painful to watch. seeing your own players move out of the way of the ball has been in the game for ages and its really time this kind of nonsense was fixed. watching a match is like pulling teeth, as your players walk to tackle, move out of their way and let the opposition clean through on goal. had this not cost 17, i would never have bought it because no fm game is worth 30. the game has become so bloated that it has forgotten its core values of what made fm such a great.",35.1
"sucks monkey balls. cheats you worse than ever. you could have the best team in the world, be leading 3-1 in a cl game but fm decides that youre to be spanked 6 or 7 goals in the return leg. dont waste your money and go spend it on a game that actually gives you what a game is supposed to. enjoyment.",345.8

"im having a love-hate relationship with this version of the game. theres some stuff to love, and a bit more to hate. but heres the main points: pros: +switching between two teams when managing a club and country is easier +considerably more realistic +sidebar, and game in general, is neat. everything is tidy, easy to look at, easy to find cons: -the team selection screen is so, so clunky -3d match engine is still awful. i still play on 2d because i cannot deal with the mistakes that will happen on 3d, like defenders passing in to their own net far more regularly than irl",168.2
"i havent played fm since the 08 so had a pretty tough beginner time with this one, but after a day everything seems ok now. i am surprised that i havent experienced the injury bug like a lot of people have been talking about in this patch, the game overall was fantastic. the only thing that pissed me off is the 3d match, really hard to tell if the players got tackled or not, sometimes it feels like the other players just purposely tackle ur players (the ones whos about to receive the ball) in the pelnaty area and nothing happens, even the commentary doesnt say anything. the models are just stupid sometimes, they just stand in one place and let the opponents run passed them. the goalkeeper never pick up the ball when they are supposed to, overall a lot of things wrong with the 3d system. hope they will develop in the next game.",111.8
"im playing fm since the old cm 2000/2001 every year and this is the worst fm ever!! half of the squad injured, the tactic did work in the first season but in the second and third i have results like in the lottery and i didnt change the whole squad only new players who plays fm knows that this is unrealistic to have such results when you u once have found your perfect tactic. this are the main bugs but there are a lot of more thats probably the lack of competition between the producers of football managers.",85.3

"same game as the last couple of years. its a little better with the newest patch but a lot of things still dont matter. - the teamspeeches dont seem to do anything or you get negative results from it even though the game says you should say that to them. - clubs controlled by the game buy up all of the best players and then dont even let them play, making it very diffecult for you to create a team that can win big prices. the players how go to those clubs and the after a year are put on the transferlist dont want to move to your club because they are playing at a better club even though they didnt play a single match. - scouting uses a system where you can see what percentage your knowledge of a player (0-100%) is but there is no option in the scoutingmenu to say scout to a 100%. and even then at 100% sometimes the players potential still isnt completly scouted. - when asking the board to raise the salarycap for staff members it gets raised by 200 euros which isnt nearly enough to get any improvements. - whenever one of your players get injured during a match its never the games fault. it never gives itself a red or even a yellow card. but you get red cards constantly. - still cant reload my save during matches. its an offline single-player game. if i want to reload my save during a match who cares. these are the main problems. and yet its still very addictive, the best football management game out there and i cant stop playing.",499.1

"so i have played fm15 after previously having the 2013 and 2008 versions. when i got my self on the 2013fm i saw a lot of changes between it and 2008. the 2015 hardly brought any changes at all. there are maybe 2 or 3 new speches in team talk, some more advanced conversations with players which are actualy harder to talk to and overal the personal chat has been developed. yes theres also a 3d game play shown rather than 2d which actualy does not add anything to a manager expirience and in my opinion is nice but unnecesary. there are few minor bugs with the game, theres also a fair play requirements to get into european competitons but other than that theres not a lot of new suprises. this is still my favourite football manager game but other than few little changes, updated squads and competition rules this game is preety much the old 2013 manager to me. its still a good game worth a buy if your upgrading your football manager 6/10. just because i expected a bit more new features. 10/10 if this is going to be your first one or much older than 2013.",853.2
