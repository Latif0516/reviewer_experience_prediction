"the best game from all civilizations, and this game have one shortage -it;s that you cant fly into space",352.0
"best civ in the row. settlers dont destroy tanks, victory can be achieved in several ways.",290.1
"this game allowed me to create a jewish-communistic america who, after developing the manhattan project during the time of the civil war , teamed up with sweeden and decemated all of the french empire with giant killer robots and battleships. 11/10 would conquest again",218.1
"it may be prettier, and the combat may be substantially better, but overall civ5 is several steps back from civ4. if i wanted to kill stuff in a turn-based strategy game, there are a lot of games that do it even better than this, and civ4 is better in almost all the non-combat areas of the game (aside from graphics, but whatever). disappointing. it does have potential though, and im hoping the expansions will eventually improve on the things that are lacking. it is significantly more approachable and easier to get into, at least. note that this is based on the base game only, and im somewhat unfairly comparing civ4 with all expansions to civ5 with no expansions.",28.5
"civilization v is a well balanced turn based game clearly focused on teh construction of a civilization. i would recommend it to annyone interested in teh ins and outs of running a nation. please enjoy.",481.1
"tried to befriend gandhi, he ends up betraying me and conquers all my cities 11/10 would play again",154.5
"great mechanics with lots of replay value. any strategy fan will enjoy what civ v has to offer. the expansions also add lots of content.",25.4
"my favorite turnbased strategy game, exept for xcom but thats a completely different kind of game, so it doesnt count.",337.1
"good, fun, thoughtful, intense. all words i would use to describe this great game.",6.5
"time blackhole. 9/10 real review. +great turn-based rts. +managing friendship between country. -expension pack are too priced for me.",16.1
"i dont get hooked onto many games but this is amazing!!!",18.7
"civ 5 was the main reason i dropped $900 on a hardcore gaming computer so yeah its got my recommendation",160.9
"this is definitely one of the best strategy games that i ever played. its dlcs expand the contents of the game dramatically and make the game worthy playing again and again to try different strategies. one thing still need to be improved is ai takes too much time every turn in late game, especially when aircraft comes out.",255.3
"amazing. needs the expansions to really shine in the endgame.",31.6
">implying that grinding every other civilization off the face of the earth then salting their lands as you suppress riots and famines in your homeland with armor rolling off the lines and pollution choking the skies isnt the best way to win every game.",209.7
"love this game! you will need both expansions to truly appreciate it. the gods and kings expansion added quite a bit to game play but with the latest expansion brave new world, more elements have been included such as trade routes, tourism, etc. that enhance the game even more. all that being said, diplomacy is still poorly executed in the game so beware of this negative aspect and enjoy what is a very good, if not excellent (4x) tbs game.",982.7
"good game, worth it. stays true to the civ legacy while also innovating itself! enjoying it a lot!",148.2
"if the vast options for gameplay is not already enough to keep you coming back, the excellent and active modding community will keep you cemented to your chair.",1046.7
"sid meier still get it, civ 5 is awesome ! with the first addon gods and kings it kicked civ4 from my favorite place of all civilization parts (played 1, net, 2, 3, 4 and 5). new tactics with a few changes like the hexagon fields on the map, only one military and only one civil unit on one field. great looking graphics and still one of the best gui i ever used in a strategie game. top !",524.2
"absolutly amazing game! probably my favourite. put in over 300 hrs and dont plan on stopping anytime soon haha havnt played many other 4x games but this one deffinetly a favourite for anyone who wants to try. highly recommended!! 10/10",346.1
"really, the best part about brave new world is that its finally addressed every victory condition in the game and made each one not only more equally viable, but also just as busy. weaponizing culture works to bring it more in line with the other conditionsits something you have to work towards and not something you just happen to achieve. on top of that, the diplomacy changes make this system more interesting as well, and it all comes down to one thing: if you have civilization v and want to play more, you owe it to yourself to get this expansion.",152.4
"never played any of the previous civilization games, but everyone kept telling me to give civilization v a try, so i did. at first i found it kind of confusing. a lot of things to keep an eye on, but after a couple of hours of play id figure it all out and i was hooked! great game! has provided me with many hours of great fun! just one more turn...",75.3
"great strategic gameplay. unfortunately the games seem to go on and on and on. still a good game. 7/10",6.6
"get friends to play this with. skype with each other. try to cooperate or murder each other, and watch the hillarity that ensures.",120.6
"one of my all time favourite games to play on steam",224.0
"the real game the best game the biggest game thumbs up",425.4
"i knew i was ment to rule the world. {evil laugh} this is a pretty laid back, turn based game. its fun :d",74.1
"if you have any interest in strategy games, you probably already have it and a couple of its predecessors. otherwise, buy it and your only regret will be that the wife left you, got the house and the kids. but hey, chances are you wont notice anyway.",914.8
"this steam mess and having to update to play a game that is installed on my pc is junk...this is ridiculous. i want to play against ai not online...let me play the game without having to wait 5 hours every month for updates...i am guessing these updates have nothing to do with game play...bad move brand civiliation! this is it...for me, that is.",347.7
"omg this game is amazing. i really havent played many of the other civilization games so i guess i can say this is my first. if youre the type of guy that likes to run an empire through different eras, then this is the game for you. i must say i had my doubts when i bought this game, but it is so addicting when you get into it. (if youre into these kind of games that is)",123.9
"i will always love civ games, but civ 5 kind of takes a step back. its not that challenging and its a lot the same as 4, but i liked 4 more. i do reccommend it though but if ur a civ fanatic like myself, its getting to be a lot of the same old.",104.7
"the game is crack. plain and simple. it will devour your life. stay away.",62.3
"if your lookingfor a strategy game with almost endless possibilites becasue of the steam workshop. your in luck!",85.2
"probably the best game iv ever played. granted im a bit biased because im practicly in love with city/society building games. i rate this game 5 nipples/strawberry.",416.5
"my definition of a perfect game! takes quite some time to get used to and learn, but once you do, there is no limit to how many hours you will want to play this game! spent 100+ hours on the campaign edition (not through steam)",133.3
"getting screwed by ghandi and maria theresa, the epiphany of gaming. great game and even better with friends.",300.8
"one of the most addicting games i have ever had the pleasure of playing. i dont know how many times ive started playing at 10pm or so and looked up at the clock to find it was 4 in the morning. so... i guess dont buy this if you really need your sleep, haha. otherwise you totally should if you like rtss, solo or with friends.",730.7
"this is one of the most amazing turned based strategy games ive evr played, althought the multiplayer disappointed me a little bit its still definitly worth the buy!",256.4
"its a great game, but only when you have the gods and kings or brave new world expansion.",173.3
"best game to play while doing other things. i have enjoyed this game since the first one came out (used floppy discs to install). play this while miniature painting. love turn based games.",124.6
"started a game to kill some time before starting my coursework that was 8 oclock now its 7 in the morning and ive got 4 hours to do my work before class on a scale of addicting i put it at x-com out of 10",71.7
"great mechanics with lots of replay value. any strategy fan will enjoy what civ v has to offer. the expansions also add lots of content.",25.4
"sid meiers civilization v is the best one yet. with many strategic victories, tons of civilizations to choose fun, and a lot of fun to play with friends, i would reccomend this game to anyone that likes a turn-based strategy game.",165.0
"very addictive and a different experience every game that you play.",113.6
"among all games ive ever played, this is the one with the greatest long-term motivation and replayability. last bought the gods and kings dlc. it invented the religion points and many more features. it brought some new aspects, units and buildings which are useful and interesting and let you play the game again and again. so ... this game is my all-time favorite!",118.2
"strange to not recommend this, given the countless hours spent playing it, but it has many annoyances that sid meier (or whoever) needs to address. the military aspect of the game remains tedious, as it was in all the previous versions. few of the systems make much sense. why, if you spend lots of resources building big ben but someone pips you to building it first, does your big ben disappear? why can a great artist do a culture bomb? why bother turning your generals into citadels, when opposing armies can just walk round them and you can only stack one unit inside? i could go on. suffice to say, civ needs some more competition.",256.4
"this is a great strategy game where you have to figure out how to efficiently allocate resources and balance needs.",574.7
"this is probably one of my favorite games. in my youth, i played axis & allies the board game. when i got older, i played the pc versions of a&a. civilization v, while different, brings back that nostalgia. i enjoy playing civilization v for hours on end.",287.8
"the joy this game has brought me is pretty much unlimited. i can say my grad work and home projects have been neglected mutliple times because i got knee deep in a new campaign. addicting game with lots of awesome game mechanics. i dont play as much anymore mainly because i dont have the time but whenever i get a spare moment, i hop on to play for as long as i possibly can. love this game!",5.6
"must-buy strategy game this game, when it has all the dlcs is way too addicting, and is a blast to play through your own alternate history. its way too easy to spent 8+ hours simply building up your own empire, and then several more in a devestating war for more land. only buy this game if it is with all the dlcs, particularly brave new world, because the dlcs add some great features that the base game missed. just buy the complete edition really. right now.",261.6
"this game is addicting. i love the strategy and the challenge of it.",54.0
"probably myfavorite fps. has a lot of the core elements in any good shooter.",43.2
"its a civ game. its not perfect - the ai is lacking, as always, and there are bugs - but its still good fun.",307.9
"civ is a fantastic game. turn based stratergy and very in depth. it looks complicated but once you get the hang of it its all fun. good and bad situtations, things can go either way. the endings fell a bit short but the expansion pack brave new world fixed that awesome game 9.5/10",227.4
"it is unbelievable how fun this game is, it has you working through the ages to grow and culture an empire to rule the world with.",69.7
"probably the most fun ive had in a game for 10 years. easy enough on the lower difficulties to get a hang for the game, and hard enough once raised to difficulty 6+ to continue challenging your strategies.",322.8
"i sunk over 100 hours into this game and i think that was just the tutorial. this game is amazing. a-maze-ing. with a capital amaze. it has problems, but i cant remember them due to my mind being blown. major time sink. divorce your wife before starting.",127.2
"extremely fun to patient and strategic players. constantly finding myself talking to the other cpus.",43.3
"this one time barbarians took my settler the very first round so i lost instantly........its very fun.",145.9
"average time spent per login: 500 minutes straight buy this .",542.4
"this game is awesome. you can be a noob and still have fun and dominate or be crushed. even though this game was released in 2010 it is still one of the most amazing sid meies games to play. i am very glad i got this on sale. 10/10",12.5
"i would personally suggest this game for anyone who like strategy games and the previous civilizations.",475.7
"love the graphics compared to civ iv! and as always, an awesome soundtrack xx",17.3
"u fukin wot gandhi???? just because my soldier was parked in your space doesnt mean you get to send your curry elephant rangers to slap his  with your 5 inch trunks. thats it, its war. gandhi?? more like... gone-di. and so, the entire indian empire was annexed by the mighty forces of korea. 17/10 better than your average history textbook",33.4
"great game, i have played over 110 hours and it never gets old!",209.3
"one of my all-time favorites. whether its the enjoyable gameplay or the absurd historical situations (where the incas can invent christianity and ghandi can become a warmongering dictator), this game never fails to entertain me.",424.1
"best game ever played. so very fun. played sweeden and destroyed greece and the native americans before jesus was even born. oh yeah!!!!",94.9
"civ 5 is a great addition to the series after all this time since its release i still dont know what to make of the city states features or the removal of the stacking of troops. civ 5 is as addicting as all that have come before - a series i have played again and again since civ 1 came out.",233.5
"this game is great if you have an hour or 12 to burn.",966.5
"barbarians razed my farms and massacred my citizens 10/10",143.8
"10/10. a true mark in the civ franchise. it has no nuke limit.",90.4
"this game has always ben a fun drop and pick up game. it is hard at times the advisors do not say alot of usefull information. the cpu seems to out perform most of the time. i do find it easy to make wonders faster then the cpu though. barbarians spawn reduculosly fast. i miss the diplomats who could bribe them and steal technology. well it has been fun though.",278.9
"i sent a nuclear bomb to spain and the game crashed. 10/10",235.5
"this game sucks hours out of your life. 10/10 would buy again",427.5
"get a group of friends and play this game, must buy",122.2
"love it and its intention. if its intention was education and enjoyment ,i rate civ 5 as n#1",70.2
"great game, i would reccommend everyone gives it a try",36.2
"great addition to an already powerful title. 9.5/10",287.6
"anyone that is a fan of turn based strategy games will enjoy civ can you stand the test of time",599.6
"this is no game. it is a time warp. apparantly i have 91 hours played. it feels more like 10-20. you have been warned.",281.6
"just one more turn, i swear, im only going to play just one.... more.... turn......",3.1
"great game to play with friends! the expansions add in content that gives the game more ways to win",162.4
"i came from playing civilization revolution on ps3 to this, and this game is absolutely amazing. most of my hours on record are with gods & kings, but brave new world adds a whole new dimension and makes going for the culture victory fun and rewarding. guiding the many unique civilizations through 6000+ years of recorded history is rewarding in itself, but then throw on the different victory conditions and the mulitple options you have every time you set up a new game, and you are almost guaranteed to have an exciting and one of a kind game every time.",719.5
"i love this game so much that i want to have sex with it!!!",58.9
"if you love causing mayhem and you are great with strategies you will love this game!!!!!!!!",112.2
"this game is fun, but complicated to learn. i would recomend this to experienced strategy players who a looking for a nice smooth game. there is a variety of ways to play, and new map sgenerated everytime! it also has a very good multiplayer system, you can play with turns, or even at the same time! hanks for reading this recomendation, i hope you choose to buy this wonderful game.",30.4
"buy this game and it will eat your brains. 0/10 needs shrek civ",52.2
"this is coming from a person who does not like turn based games. i bought the super package and enjoy the game. i played this game vanilla, and did not enjoy this game. if you play this with turns i highly recommend a 3 minute timer. some people lose track of time and become rude by making people wait. that said this can be a very fun game. do not look for action, but a quiet evening with this game. try and have a book handy, or the tv on a show thats pretty good. end verdict this is great clean fun. 8.5/10",70.7
"a fabulous game that simulates perfectly how awful ghandhi is",146.9
"this is a good game but sooo much dlc.... they want all our money",974.6
"a great way to spend a lot of time on a strategy game. first time playing a civ game and it was very easy for me to get into and understand after a few playthroughs. the achievements for this game definitely give me something to play for, as well. highly recommend!",119.7
"this game is a fun game for people who likes strategical games.",170.4
"mah a mah a mah mothering a, yeah i recommend this . buy it or some crap like that, dont torrent #torrentsnot4me",55.4
"great game with lots of hours of gameplay multiplayer and singleplayer. well done 2k games for a great strategy. if you want a pack i would recommend getting complete edition as it comes with most dlcs and is worth the money. great game, great game. looking forward to the future of the game!! :)",138.9
"this game took my life, its destroying my social life and i have lost all ability to sport. 10/10",86.5
"i dont know how, but i have seen more sunrises playing this game than any other.",99.6
"being a fan of the civilization franchise civilization v was something of a disappointment when i first played, however that was because i naive and my expectations wasnt matching what the game was about. after coming back to the game i realize that a lot the features that have been implemented while i was gone and all the expansion pack have turned the game into a solid piece of work. it is fun building civilizations and conquering enemies that have an uncanny capabillity of out doing you at every turn. the technology is realistic somewhat and the non-stacking units take some time to get use. however i would recommend this to everyone who wants to build a nation from ground up and conquering multiple enemies. i just wish that there were more micro government options oh-well still it is a good game to by time and have fun.",352.1
"too addicting. some really great improvements over civ. 4 (one troop per tile, etc.)",158.5
"probably the most fun ive had with my friends since halo on the computer. you can sit there all day relaxing pumping out a game of civ while you either beat each other to a pulp or wreck an ai all while shoving religion down peoples throats. plus where else can you get attila the hun vs george washington? didnt think so!",621.6
"very good bit of a time steeler tho look at clock it 8pm then look back wat feels like 10min its 2am lol",170.4
"i sat down to play this game once, twice at most. i had no idea i even played this game for 17 hours within that time frame. the game is addicting, and even though it was addicting i was still left wishing it was more complex. i think civilization 4 is more up my alley as it is more complex but i cant dedicate the hours to it.",17.1
"with the brave new world expansion this game is amazing. without it its a no good.",274.8
"an amazing game. i recommend everyone get it. need i say more?",100.7
"the game that makes you king of the world (if you so deisre) just watch out for gandhi and his nukes.",739.5
"i hope you dont have a life because with this game your going to forget you had one. civilization is a srategy game where you command your cilivilzation by build cities, going to war and trying to dominate your enemy, or going to the moon any many other things you can do when you play this game. this is one of the funniest and most time consuming games i have ever played and it is worth the price and the amazing dlc that lets you make trade routes with other civs out there or even creating your own religion to spread faith across the globe and gives you many more civlizations the play as. buy this game now! the only thing you will regret is that you havnt showered in days because of this game.",182.4
"ive been playing since civ 1, played and bought civ ii, civ iii, civ iv and now civ v. it is good. but be sure to buy the complete edition. you will sleep less because of it, promise.",158.7
"wonderful, hands down! - just wish that it wasnt so cpu extensive. :(",36.2
"best game ever, just finnished my first game as the dutch and going back for a second!!!",22.9
"this isnt game dosnt have the highest played hours in my library for nothing... well maybe its that the game takes days and sometimes weeks to complete... but with infinite play through possibilities its a game one could play constantly... :)",602.1
"im not a fan of turn-based strategy so i was going to be quite a hard sell on this. however, in the 50 hours ive racked up in the first two weeks of owning the game, im fairly thrilled and enjoying it. you can tinker with a single or multiplayer game for days on end and just calmly murder that bloody irritating ghandi in your own time. ive barely even touched the available mods for the game, so ive still got that excitement coming to me. all in all, a nice timekiller, and can even be played while youre doing other things.",91.6
"one of the best strategy games ever, make sure you get all of the dlc before you play though!",58.1
"just one more turn. no, its never just one more turn. very addictive and fun. good for when you got a lot of time to spend.",30.8
"ive lost about 12 hours to this game in the first 2 days......its fantastic!",12.0
"played 37 hours of this  in the last 3 days. if you buy it, dont expect to re assimilate back to the real world.",81.3
"holy shitballs where did the time go. started a marathon game back in nam with a few friends and here we are i dont even know what millenium it is.",226.4
"this game is very fun. it has alot of ways to play the games and alot of ways to win. but the game is funnest when you have all of the dlc. you should definitly get this game if you like strategy.",1068.4
"i think this is one of the best strategy games of all time!",73.3
"civ v just feels lacking for some reason, particularly compared to civ iii. cant really put my finger on it but it just feels like civ for those that dont want to really learn a complicated game. 6/10.",39.7
"you came to  es and buy civ 5. have you bought civ yet?",180.1
"this is actually the first strategy game ive every played and so far, im quite impressed. it peaks your interest and keeps you entertained for hours. it allows you to play in single player and in multi-player mode. highly recommended and thus far in my opinion is one of the best turned-based strategy games out there.",189.3
"brilliant game. its an excellent time killer and its not hard to get a grasp of either. the diplomatic panel is smooth and pretty easy to use and the movement is basic but effective. 9.5/10",459.2
"with all the expansions and dlc, civ 5 is not acutally that bad of a game, and is quite fun. plus it has mods. mods are awesome, and some of them are quite good, others are quite bad.",103.3
"i got this for free from green man gaming a few months ago, but it is worth what i would have paid for it. virtually all pcs can play it so you dont need to worry about your specs too. all it needs is a canadian civilization and it would be perfect.",318.0
"though my power level is only in the 700+ range, i will have a blast rising towads the stronger fighters in this realm",811.2
"i would reccommend this game to the strategy gamers and those who have the patience enough to see their empire growing from humble beginnings to a mighty nation. its graphics are amazing and it has an addictive single & multi-player as well totally suitable for friends who intend to have some fun :) lead your nation to greatness!",58.6
"if youre a civ fan and enjoy turn-based strategy, it really doesnt get any better than this! all the best parts of civ 1, 2 & 3 without the let downs of civ 4!",194.7
"played this before work and all i did was think about it for the rest of the day",259.0
"love this game, very addictive. i play it for hours on end",751.0
"this is a fun strategy game that looks and acts like a board game would, as luck plays quite a part in this game from time to time. although it is horribly optimised, it does not talke alt-tabbing kindly, and after youre done playing this game and want to do something else, you should reboot your pc. dont get me wrong on this, though, this is still very fun to play, although the games take long, and you should limit multiplayer gaming to friends only, if you ask me, these games can easily take 8 hours or more. go get it if youre into strategy board-like games, its a great pickup at the price. brave new world also isnt a bad pickup, as it expands the game greatly.",143.3
"this game is incredible, its fun and addictive, theres soo many different civilizations avalible to pick from. the civilization i prefer to go with is napoleon or america.",155.1
"an amazing game to take away some time, and loose your self in a world where your the god and can dictate the turning of time.",513.5
"civilization v is an awesome game and one of the best (if not the best) empire management games available. well worth the money.",125.5
"if you have 8 hours to kill, this is the game for you. protip: never trust ghandi.",115.6
"good fun, but is significantly better with expansions, especially bnw. good variety of difficulties; from derpy for newcomers to complex for experts.",175.6
"great game. just when you think youre doing good the three leaders youve been trading with declare war on you and pillage you.",78.5
"me: im just gonna play for about 2 hours. *five hours later and game ends* me: well,  and i didnt even win 10/10 would kill off montezuma first",190.5
"amazing!!!! its the best strategy game i have ever played!",22.2
"ive been playing civilization seriess since 2003. still wonderfull.",246.3
"heres the concept - you get to be the english empire(other inferior civilizations are available) and take over every other civilization in the world. also, sometimes you get to have what can losely be called a war with the french. this is a must have game, it is genuinely fun with friends and even singleplayer.",39.7
"this game is one of my favourite games ever, it is really fun to play with friends and solo, if you want a game you can play for a few hours or even an hour, this game is for you, civ 5 described in one word, #fantabulous",109.8
"dropping nukes and atomic bombs as gandhi is deeply satisfying",41.3
"this game is one of my favourites in my library. its a game for anyone that loves or likes geography, it teaches you about history and lets you mold history in your way. i recommend you play this game with friends, you can play online and solo, but its a little more fun with someone you know and like to play games with. i recommend this game! 9/10",71.5
"if you like managing empires, nuking george washington, and spending 6 hours playing a game you meant to play 40 minutes with, then there ya go.",168.6
"amazing a few minor issues but not enough to say no to the game. all in all great compared to the past versions. if you loved civilization in the past worth a buy. if you had a hard time with past civilizations this game has fixed a lot of issues why you may have no liked it. i give it a 4.5 out of 5",147.2
"over the river, and through the woods, there all my movement points go...",507.4
"great game addictive only one more turn turns into about 100 more really quick. the depth and history are awesome especially for history ppl. totally recommend this game to all!",260.6
"regularily steals 5+ hours of my life. well worth this and all dlc",91.8
"great turn-based strategy game. even more fun with friends on marathon settings.",48.8
"i have put an absurd amount of time into this game, and it still doesnt feel like ive done enough. there are literally millions of ways to change the game, how its played, your current situation in-game, your interface, blah blah blah. most important thing i learned is that deity is difficulty is hard as  and gandhi shouldnt be ed with in the atomic era. id recommend this game to anyone looking for a good way to pass the time or a really competitive nerd.",408.9
"addictive as hell. just one more turn. worth getting the expansions.",24.5
"its different from the previous civ games. not worse, just different. the old ones 1-4, were only really strategically challending, but civ 5 is much more tactically challenging. its still about the overall strategy of where to build cities, when, how and how much you want to expand... but in civ 5, you have to think a lot more about the placement of your troops. i like this change, and if you want to play each eras units in proper wars (and have the time to do so), a marathon length game is quite fun... but its going to take some 50-100 hours to get to the endgame!",244.6
"ah civilisation 5, what a good game. been playing every now and then since release. this is the only game where gandi is a nuking warlord. would highly recomend this game to gamers of all ages. one tip when buying as well as buying the bace game also buy dlc as the dlc really makes the game what it is, without the dlc the game can get a bit repetitive. so stop reading this and go buy the god dam thing!",236.0
"ive always loved the civ games and this one is even better.",121.1
"this game lets you act out your anger on the chinese by building a mass army and taking over their cities and renaming them stuff like land of the small weewees 10/10 goty",35.2
"got nuked by ghandi when i was still in the ancient era. 10/10",5.2
"build nukes in japan and get the roman empire on your  while building a granary in your capital.",42.6
"fun game, nice to kill time or just play with friends! lots of replayability as well.",31.7
"this is one immersive turn-based strategy game thats sure to suck a scary portion of your life away... :d",305.4

"amazing strategy game. i have spent countless hours in this addicting turn based game.",157.4
"ive played basically every came in the sid meiers franchise. civ5 is a great installment, i like it better than civ4 especially with the brave new world expansion. i wish firaxis has spent more time on performance of the game engine -- it takes up a ton of system resorces especially in late game scenarios. but over all, really fun and has a good multiplayer experience although there are a few glitches.",69.8
"love it, no matter how many times i play its always different",136.5
"a fun and creative game that is great for any fan of strategy games. its lack of realism is compensated for by its amazing gameplay.",105.0

"my first game on steam. its the start of my addiction, i h ave since then moved on. however this game still remains one of my favourites because i played it the most and its what got me into the pc gaming community, it was awesome!",30.8

"addictive fun that will cause you to sink hours of your life into it. the gradual but constant progression means that you almost always feel like your about to reach a stopping point in game resulting in you playing just one more turn and before you know it its morning. advised not to be played if a deadline is coming up.",674.7
"challenging and crazy fun. this game makes time disappear.",142.9
"maybe just one more turn.... mmmm just one more. wait why is it 4 in the morning now.",115.2
"its good, very, very good. buy this instead of beyond earth. nuff said.",427.8
"besides my constant crashing its a pretty fun game",55.6
"this is an exceptionally great turn based strategy game. i havent played many other games like this but it has encouraged me to. i actually hadnt played the other 4 games in the civilization series and i found getting into the game a bit tricky but with the help of some mates and the wiki i managed to love the game. i ended up creating a relatively awesome empire only to be crushed by a backstabbing friend. so if youre wondering wether to buy this game or not i would recommend you do and buy the dlc brave new world, it adds so much and makes it so much better. buy it, get into the game and start up with your friends.",93.6
"great game, easy to play and very fun. after playing too much it starts getting boring, maybe the multiplayer its a great thing to try. 8/10",47.0
"a more comprehensive and engaging civ experience than ever before. with the steam community churning out so many mods, civ 5 has achieved infinite replayability. i give it a whole-hearted recommendation.",111.3
"great turned based strategy. good fun with multiplayer - but expect a chess like game, rather than full on action. very addictive and replayable.",105.5

"one of my favorit games well worth the price, the dlcs will increase the enjoyment multiple times over",386.3
"before i started playing, i pictured this game as being kinda like rts games ive played like age of empires. this is more turn-based and strategic than other games, with an emphasis towards building up over a long period of time. and yeah, i mean looooong. games can get fairly lengthy, though its pretty easy to put them on pause, even in multiplayer. theres definitely a learning curve, and while the tutorials are adequate for the basics, theres a lot of nitty gritty stuff that trips you up the first few games. overall, this is a great game for turn-based strategy, with lots of replayability, especially if you can get a couple of friends to join you for a long evening session.",92.3
"killing people is very fun in this game. 10/10 ign",65.6
"wery good game but europe universal is much bether",14.2

"this game... omg this game! its the first game ive ever managed to play for 8 hours straight without ever getting bored... that ought to tell you something about it",60.7
"warning: this game is addictive. you will find yourself spending hours to defeat your opponents. and you will enjoy every minute of it.",17.4
"i always find myself saying just one more turn.. then its morning.",130.7
"9/10 only played it for a few hours, and with my pc, it was mainly loading screen hours. but for the time i did play it, it was a great game. fantastic turn based strategy, great graphics, easy to learn controls, and grand follow up dlc that just gives variety, not an overpowering force. my favorite part is the research tree, a system i feel many strategies have only started to do, and have done so poorly.",18.5
"it is good. wish there was a faster game time though otherwise with friends it is a long effort.",143.0
"i dont know much about the civilization series as a whole but i have played civilization revolution (i know some dont consider it apart of the series) on the xbox 360 and the game stays true to what it is all about, that one more turn addiction, and single matches that can go on for weeks to months. i highly recommend this game to fans of strategy with the new hexes instead of the usual average tiles and the elimination of stacking units. to fans of the series you probably already bought it and to those who arent particularly a fan of strategy still try the demo im sure youll find something good on it that will keep you hooked.",159.7
"very nice game, easy to understand. strategy is very important here, but theres a little of adventure too. with new dlcs it is much funnier to play! you can win the game in some different ways, personally i always won with science victory. with the workshop contents, it is more interesting, but most of the addons require dlcs. soometimes it can be buggy. 8,5/10",119.2
"if you are a strategy fan and like turn-based games, buy it. if not, i wouldnt recommend it. doesnt get old very easily.",715.2
"while the updates to the hex grid, and one unit per tile might seem game breaking and daunting, it really adds to the fun. you no longer require a rolling stack of death to get anything accomplished. with proper army and terrain management, you can take out their entire army with a few smart choices. what else do you need? its still civ at its core.",60.2
"this is an amazing game, i would recommend buying it. if you do buy it, make sure you have friends to play it with as it is much more fun with friends.",78.2
"there is a reason why i call myself civ, cause im the best around just like this game!",399.6
"four years after its release, its still an entertaining game. much of it can nourish your brain with strategic imaginations, lifetime ideas as well as historical learnings. much of what the era is here all depends on you. you can even control historical leaders too! notably bonaparte napoleon! pretty much like those city games but this one delievers alot more than those kinds of games. and hey, dlcs of this game is twice the fun!",23.8
"i played until i forgot to eat and  my pants 4.5/5 stars",514.4
"this is a turn based strategy game with very nice graphics. its very intense at times. if you enjoy strategy games that you can dump 6 hours into and not even feel it, you will love civ 5. the dlcs for this game make it feel complete, gods and kings is what brings the religion as well as espionage, back into the civilization series; which fits very nicely into this game. brave new world is very fun; it adds alot to the game ( trade routes, new civs, new policy system). out of all my hours ive never seen any bad that takes value away from the game. however, the base game alone will not have as much depth as if you had gold edition or bnw. i highly recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games.",261.9
"it took me a while to get into this game, but when i did, boy was i hooked. very fun and exciting game, and im sorry i didnt purchase it sooner!",12.7
"like crack, but better. yesterday, i started playing a quick game agains five other civs. ten hours later, i won the cultural victory and i wiped out two nations off the face of the earth. basically, if you havent played this yet, you need to. but make sure youve pooped before playing.",13.1
"this game... just look at the hours i have put into it and i still havnt touched all the civilizations, playsyles, or even the map settings. single player, multiplayer, mods, dlc, this game does everything everyone says it does. one small flaw i will note is the ai is very hipocrytically unforgiving. attack a warmongering race and eliminate their capitol and it triggers a domino effect that gets the whole world declairing war on you. attacked a city state at the start of the game and conqured it, reached turn 300 still basically begging for forgivness from other civs. reguardless of that the game plays flawwlessly *for me* is absolutlely beautiful and will keep you comming back for years to come. even when you put it down, youll want to pick it up again in a month or two just to see what this scenerio would imply to the world another 50 hrs and 7 games later.",419.3
"love this game to bits, but.... alexander: you are settling near us, stop it! 2 turns later alexander of greece has founded corinth! *looks for corinth* corinth is right below kyoto",211.3

"what a surprise! ive never played civ until three days ago. i still wondering why didnt i install the game and played it right away after my purchase. this is a great great game. even if youre not a fan of strategy games or so you should play this civ v.",13.3
"i simply cannot get enough of this game. i play very often and for long periods at a time. in my opinion, it is the best thing i have ever played, and i have played a lot. i love the concept, the ideas, the execution, and all the many things that go into this game. i preach the gospel of civilization v to all of my friends. im not the best at explaining why i like it though, so you should really just try it out for yourself.",701.9
"very good game that i recomend for gamers it is a game about history",596.8
"best game ever, the ultimate game to play with 2-infinity friends, although you need to buy the dlc in order for the game to really shine.",159.9

"a fanstastic game, youll spend hours playing this.",179.9
"civ 4 was great. almost flawless, exept it was super buggy. bit civ 5 fixed all those bugs, made graohical improvements, and increased the politiacal part of the game. it was great to be able to use youre money for stuff, and all units can go on water. this game is bacially like civ 4 but easyer to star out with. wars were much more fun becasue the cities can defend themselves without units. the polotics of the new game made it alot more fun to play against ai, becase they are super violent and offendable, so there will be alot more war, which is good fun. the games are also alot longer becase by the 20th century, each turn was a single year so a game could easily be 10 hours long. i fully recomed this game. 9/10",86.7

"a great game, great strategy. if you desire to be the ruler of the world via conquest or diplomacy. wish to form a more cultured world or to simply leave your enemies on earth while you travel to a distant star. this is the game to play.",242.2
"this game is an intersting strategy game. it has many unique features to it, all of which lead to a great game. however, if you are looking for depth, there isnt much. civilisation 4 had much more depth which was more and more fun to it as you discoverd it. for people who have never played a civ game, this is a great option. for those who are civilisation experts, this isnt for you.",47.5
"this game is terrific and fun to play with friends",112.5
"what the  dude its like crack cocaine you lose your life playing this  if it wasnt clear i love this game",118.2
"great game but it crashes here and there dose anyone know if there is a patch out for it to get it to stop crashing while playing. dose not happen all the time tho.",530.9
"the civ series should probably come with a warning label as being one of those game series most likely to cause a video game addiction.",56.1
"really additcting game, spent multiple hours taking over the world through dominitating and destroying with robots and nukes and also through winning the space race. their are multiple ways to win a campaign and that just makes it even better. civ 5 is a must buy for strategy lovers!",121.7
"yes this game does infact kickass and is very fun and addicting 10/10 would bang again",132.9
"best game ive played in 10 years! extremely addictive. beware, you will have no life after you play this!!",169.0
"another creat tittle in the civ series. fans of strategy need to get this game. plus all the user created mods really add more replay value. i mean who wouldnt want to be their favorite character from mass effect? a must by for the thinkers",139.8
"i reccomend playing this before bed and studying, it helps you concentrate.",17.8
"this is a truly great game. one of the best. at times it may be slow but that end reward of destroying all of your friends long and hard work is extremely satisfying. the soundtrack is stunning with cultural music made specificaly for civ. it is one of the most intense games ive ever played. the split second desicions that can affect the rest of the game are perfectly placed. this is one of my favorite games. if you like any sort of strategy you will fall in love with civ.",110.7
"fun game good time sink, can be hard to get into at first and learn everything. if you like in depth stragty games go for it",60.3
"civilization gets mainstreamed! less demanding in the micromanagement department but most of the changes make for more interesting gameplay. culture and religion are now currencies you can expend -- the former to unlock civic trees and the latter to buy improvements. both are essentially proxies for mini-perks that boost various resources. espionage is now menu based and more efficient. city-states add a new dynamic to diplomacy and warfare. one unit per hex eliminates stacking and speeds up combat time. overall: different, less tedious, but not necessarily worse. only truly egregious thing was the shameless milking of dlc.",139.8
"this game is so good, there should be an civ anonymous group",433.8
"downloaded a mod, it caused the name of my empire to change depending on policies and religion, formed the islamic state of america, 8/8 would gandhi again",433.9
"this game is amazing. games might take a while to start. i give it a",60.4
"easily one of my favorite games. seriously, if you still dont have it, you dont know what the meaning of life is.",125.7
"one of my favourite stratergy games so much fun yet it takes a lot of time to play and adding mor civs via workshop makes it even better",15.4
"probably the best sid meier game yet. i would recommend this for anyone who like a plot line in their game, this has all kinds of technologies you can research plus alot more. i really enjoy this game.",66.9
"this game is worse then drugs! if you start playing it.... you cant quit!",468.3
"great game worth the money, but you might want to wait for a sale like i did 10/10",56.7
"60 hours within less than 10 sessions, addicting, simple but elegant.",97.9

"one of the best games i have ever played! it is so addicting, and when you start, you cant turn it off.",114.5
"i dont know who this sid meiers person is, but he stole my copy of civs v.",63.2
"civilization v is a beautiful game, capturing the struggles of a leader trying to create a dominant empire to rise above the others. somehow, it manages to be both simple and complex. it is mostly realistic and offers some humorous irony and increased difficulty in the form of ghandi. however, its dlc are way overpriced for the amount of content they actually offer and it gets boring after the first few playthroughs. overall, it is an amazing game that will keep you invested for hours on end, keeping you on your toes until the last turn. [9.5/10]",49.2
"too busy taking another turn to right a review, but this game is genius.",184.3

"this game will ruin your life. but buy it. but it will seriously ruin your life.",17.6
"if you like being part of a country that is inadequate in becoming a world superpower, i would recommend this. if you feel adequate and are able to win this game in online multiplayer, then you sir, are a .",18.8
"i could speak volumes about how much ive enjoyed this game, however, ill try to keep it short. 1) this game is the standard by which all 4x games are currently measured 2) this game and skyrim are the highest quality games ive played in my lifetime in terms of pretty much every metric there is. i will give this one the edge on balance over skyrim though. (yes i realize they are 2 separate genres) even if youre not sure how you feel about strategy games i would suggest this one as a great starting point so that at least the frustrations of poor design dont mar your initial experience and you can truly decide for yourself based on the gameplay whether or not you are a strategy fan. i wish more game developers could uphold the standard of quality that civ 5 exhibits.",582.6
"civ 5 without dlc is very fun but once you get all the dlc, theres no going back. having all the dlc maybe expensive but its 100% worth it. civ is a great, fun stragetegy game. you can play with friends, random people or just by yourself. there are 8 different difficulties so you can choose whether you want it to be easy or hard. there is a campgain so to speak that you can do. they dont follow off eachother but theyre fun. so to conclude if you like strategy games i highly recommend getting civ, lots of fun!",784.4
"amazing, im totally addicted... the dlc is heaven, its a recommended for new and old civ players :p",465.7

"play this game if you dont mind losing hours of your life without realizing it. it is highly addictive!",33.7
"if youre reading this, and have not yet purchased this, go do it now. thank me later.",201.3
"best strategy game ever made. if you love generating resources, planing strategic attacks, biulding up an empire, then this is a game for you. i recomend this game to every one who like strategy on a large scale (the game is more about generating resources than contrling units on a very small an tactic scale.",752.8
"civilization games keep getting better and better! civilization v is the latest, and arguably the greatest in the series. lots of leaders to pick from, and every expansion has added a lot of depth to the game. with several victory conditions and different civilizations with their own strengths and weaknesses to choose from, replayability is endless. playing with friends in a ffa against ais civs for hours at a time is also fun. highly recommended if youre a turn-based strategy fan.",363.9
"lost hors to the game so may methods of play and civs to star as its great",238.1
"great game! love it! a uniuqe expirience that requires stratigic thinking and planing turns wisely. overall, a fun game!",78.2
"warning: may take up to an eternity to finish one match. 5 stars. would definitely reccomend.",26.5
"one of my favorite games of all time, ai pathing is a bit wierd but not all the time, a great amount of dlc and alot of fun if your willing to put in alot of hours",77.8

"+++ for linux port. great game for great os - nice combo!",49.5

"one of the best turn-based strategy games around sid meierss civilization is still going strong since 1990",1.8
"this game blows. after decades of civ2-4 play, i tried over and over to get into this game. i couldnt. its civ in risk: the board game form. actually, id venture to say its less complex than risk. dont waste your time. its unfortunate im about 4 years too late on this one.",34.9
"super addictive game, you can start playing a small campaign and when you look to the cloock, 8 hours have passed. not recomended for those with no time!",17.6

"simply put, perhaps the best turn-based strategy game ever.",403.4
"one of the best strategy games of all time. a must have for an sid meiers fan.",170.9
"fun in depth game. if you dont like turned based games then this isnt for you. the dlcs expand the game alot and add alot more to it. you will learn to hate the world congress if you do not own it. and no matter what you do on the higher dificulties like imortal and diety, you will struggle. but you will go out with a bang. or you play lower level and are equal to everyone. or basic and destroy everyone",236.2
"i love this game. except when my friend nukes me after an epic game when im about to win. if this were a review for my friends, itd say not recommended. but its for the game, and for that i easily say thumbs up.",248.5
"great game, manages to balance calming gameplay as you dominate everyone on the table, but on the other hand ramps the competetive pressure when playing with freinds. great multiplayer experience.",66.1
"i think im playing for 45 minutes, i play for 5 hours.",19.6
"civilization v might just be the most addictive videogame i have ever played. the allure of building a civilization from nothing to a global superpower is one that nobody can resist. the games political and militaristic intrigue is more absorbing than anything else youll find on steam, and for a game that doesnt even have a predetermined story that is saying a lot. its expansion packs are more than just glorified dlc; they actually add heaps of extra depth and possibilities to every session. this game will chow down on your free time like atilla chows down ancient era cities. civ v will ruin your life, but you will not give a single .",208.0

"a really good game to buy if you like strategic games .",17.8
"with the latest expansion, brave new world, this is probably the best turn-based strategy game out there. civ 5 has now reached the pinicle of the evolution of the civ francise. i say this as a player who first played civ over 20 years ago on my 386 and has played all the civ games apart from civ 2. whereas most 90/early 2000s pc games that have been rebooted or updated in the last 5 years have been dumbed down as if developers think we are all xbawks kiddies with adhd (im looking at you simcity, hitman, wolfenstein, thief, etc), the civ series has actually been improved with time and has become a deeper game.",580.0
"its civ... what more can be said. by far the best of the series. have enjoyed many an hour playing it and without any bug, crashes, or other anomolies that would detract from enjoyment. i look forward to civilization vi when ever that gets developed and released. highly recommend.",846.6

"this game is so good i stop myself from playing it to save my social life",39.4

"this is a great turn by turn strategy game. build your empire, by brute strength or push for diplomacy. with all the add ons and mods, there are hours upon hours that could be spent enjoying this game. my only issue, is with the constant crashing on apples os. otherwise, i would highly recoomend it.",35.5
"great game that is ridiculously addictive. great replay value.",285.4
"this game is sick. its fun if you need something that takes time and practice to play. you wont be an expert over night, but youll love it either way.",46.7
"peaceful strategy game with fantastic music, wonderful quotes from famous people, and amazingly accurate historical information within. due to its slower and highly strategic gameplay, its probably not for everyone. but it is easy to learn; it plays like a much like if chess, risk (stratego), and warhammer 20k had a baby; but with historically accurate units and structures. however, be aware that this game is a horrendous resource hog. no matter how powerful your machine, this game will slow it down.",393.4
"sid meiers civilization v is a game you buy once, and you play forever. it never goes out of style, it never becomes repetitive, it never stops amazing me. from the strategic mastermind that wants to conquer the whole world, to the peaceful leader who aims to become world leader through delegation, and to even the man of vision, that wants his civilization to reach the stars -and beyond- it is a game that fits your playstyle, and sets only one question -one that is narrated to you with every start of a match: will you be able to make a civilization that will last the test of time?",121.8
"by far the best civilization game of all. better than total war and europa universils 4.",323.6

"the reason i got this game was because i watched the yogscast play this game so i decided to buy this but i dont think this game is complete without brave new world. even though i say that i would still rate it 5 stars because i have bought all the expansions for this game and will continue to",435.5
"-bad game engine optimization -bad a.i. -tech tree is not as good as civ 4 -spock has a better voice -lazy patch work -2k -bad civ personalities -trend of removing game content for dlc for a extra overpriced amount. like we dont know. -denouced by all for being peaceful -not alpha centauri 2 +good graphics +good hud display +raging barbies should always be checked +fun multiplayer options +good background music +moddable if you can get the complete edition for cheap i recommend it at 5 or 10 $$$",258.3
"you can easily get addicted to this game. it is a very well done strategy game that is great whether it is played alone or with friends.",224.0
"its a great game. however multiplayer is a mess. i play multiplayer anyway thou. one of my favorite features is that you can see the person you are talking to in singleplayer. sadly multiplayer takes all of that away. civ can have its moments most of them in multiplayer but i cant help but feel like i am doing the same thing over and over. thats when u pause your current playthrou and continue later. dont recommend the single version. buy the complete pack for maximum value (alot better with bnv and gak)",56.8

"well to start, civ is an amazing game even if you dont have friends to play with! the ai isnt a pushover and can be quite challenging based on your difficulty level. but playing with friends is where all the fun is at! you can build up your own empires and then take down your own friends in so many different, and strategic ways! i should warn you, the game requires a lot of time, as each game runs for a few hours or more. also, it is very complicated at first so dont get overwhelmed! and finally, this is a very strategic game! it requires a lot of straetgies to take down opponents and win. but other than that, have fun!",110.7
"first time ever playing a civilization game.. i played nonstop for five straight hours. 11/10",95.5
"amazing game, extremely addicting and fun. just dont play it without the brave new world expansion, it adds really nice stuff and fix a lot of problems in the base game and gods and kings expansion. totally worth it to buy the complete edition when its 50% off. :)",631.9
"this is a game where you will spend hours playing. you will neglect to eat, sleep, or even go to the bathroom just to watch your country grow and prosper. if you have 5-7 hours to spare, this is a great time sink.",383.4
"i spend more time on this than i do jacking off, and im a single teenage boy. 12.14/10",148.3
"didnt sleep for 72 hours, but denamark is dead now so 10/10.",212.8
"i dont understand how this game can be one of the most popular strategy games... its s-h-i-t... im not kidding, awful hexagone-style gameplay, didnt like it at all, but i have to admit that in the beginning when i first tried it out, i liked the diplomacy aspect of the game... the rest.. no so much",66.7
"very fun game, but i feel that it is a lot better with some of the dlc",24.4
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",51.1
"excellent addition to the civilization franchise. it took a while to get used to the new culture system, but i would highly recommend this game to any fans of civ.",49.4
"the latest instalment in the civilization series number five sees the biggest changes in the established format. the game is based on an entirely new game engine with hexagonal tiles instead of the square tiles of earlier games. the combat system has been overhauled, removing stacking of military units and enabling cities to defend themselves by firing directly on nearby enemies. computer controlled city-states are a new feature which allows you to befriend and trade with, if the neighbouring a.i. is not offering trade due to them panicking over your troop build up on yours and their border. the dlc - gods and kings adds religion and espionage features that were already in civilization iv, but strangely left out of the base civ v game. coming from previous civilizations takes a little getting used to but overall this is a solid outing. 8 and half out of 10 kiwifruit.",118.9
"this is a great game, and has unlimited replayability.",286.4
"just spent a goof 4 hours playing this, and considering the normal length of time id play a strategy game for is about 10 minutes thats a good sign!",50.3
"hell of a game -- one of the only games ive breaches 200 hours with. every new game is an entirely different challenge.",260.4
"i dont know what you guys are talking about. ghandi seems like a nice guy :p",49.0
"(warning) this game has ruined my life!!! its the most amazing and challenging game i have ever played (besides dayz) its that type of game there is famous for destroying friendships. when your are in this game you think you can control it, but when you suddenly discover that its 3 in the morning and you think just one more round, just one more well, after a couple of hundred rounds you are going to commit sucide because gandhi nuked you and bismark destroyed your navy... but you havent played a proper strategy game before you have played civilization 5...",398.6
"my absolute favorite game that i have ever played. i never get sick of it. everyone should get the experience of getting nuked by gandhi, attilas loud voice, and ruling the world.",295.2
"very good turn based strategy with very complex elements.",9.1
"playing peacefully the entire game. becoming a highly technological civilization. gets invaded by a foreign country. defends borders agaisnt the invaders. gets condemned by the world for being a warmongerer. world congress embargoes me. builds nukes. takes over the world. 11/10 would take over the world cause i was bullied again",347.9
"took one look at the artwork/graphics and said nah. and that was that for a long time. i eventually gave in to all the hype when it was on sale and omfg, its only like the best grand strategy ive ever played! entire days have been happily lost since.",91.1
"i have played every single civilization since the very first one came out. this is definitely one of my favorites and has its own unique feel to it.",443.3
"this game is a version of monopoly, only instead of taking your friends money and watching the light drain from their eyes you are taking everything they have spent hours creating(probably by force) and laughing as they cry and break their computer.",159.9
"far too easy to spending hours playing this game... you may miss meals, blow past your intended bed time... and yet still a great game.",138.1
"i have seen a whole day dissovolve away into nothingness while this game is up. just one more turn... pets need feeding... i need feeding... help me...",711.7
"one of the best games i own!!!! p.s. try to use every civ to beat the game its fun!",337.8
"very good game, especially if its just one those sick days where you cant get off of the couh, very time consuming",135.0
"civilization v is a great game, i like just about everything in the game. the only thing i dont like is the price of dlc! for all of the dlc it costs $100+ but if you buy the bundle that indludes the base game and all of the dlc it will cost $50. still kinda high for the dlc. make it cheaper 2k!!!",20.2
"buy. this. game. i love it, and have nearly 300 hours played. it is addicting, and you will lose track of time and possibly your loved ones. so many things to say about this game. its beautiful, diverse, detailed and fun! you can chose from many different civs and build and empire to conquer or negotiate your way to victory. many fun achievements and easter eggs, special units and ways to win. this is my favorite strategy game!",462.6
"brilliant game, wish i had brave new world though, my only complaint is that the palace view that was in civ 3 is gone:(, but i gtg and play more civ 5",142.1
"brilliant series, and this game, to me, is the best of them. now, the most terrifying to realize is that the game is so precise to how governments work, this guy would make an excellent president. goddammit sid, you are good.",8.2
"this is a game i always find myself constantly coming back to. if you do not have this game, i highly recommend this game for all types of gamers.",176.1
"the first game in the civ series not to be better than the one before, but not in a bad way. its different. gameplay has been changed so much, this is not really the evolution of civ iv, but a reimagining of the whole game. new hexagonal grid, improved victory conditions, completely revamped politics and religions (moreso with dlcs gods and kings/brave new world), civilizations that change the gameplay much more. now you cant stack military units. even this simple change makes war so much different. now you cant siege a city with 50 riflemen on the same square or defend it with with 40 pikemen. if you liked older civ games or you just like turn based strategy, you wil love this game so much.",219.5
"this is a highly enjoyable game for the people who enjoy turn-based-stratagy games. it is better for people that would go indepth into the games mechanics and the scenarios.",777.7
"i bought this game on offer with all dlc and i have to say, it is a very good game. the gameplay is very addicting and you always want to complete just one more turn. there is progression, so you can be bad at the game and still really enjoy it. the features seem quite balanced and are fair on players. you can play it however you want, with other victories than just killing everyone. plus, it even runs lag-free on my non-gaming laptop. overall, i do very much recommend.",18.7
"just picked this game up, and this is the first one ive played. gotta say its pretty aweseome, one of those easy to pick up but hard to master type games. all in all, its good. i highly recommend this!",37.0
"the newest game in the civilization series and the best in my opinion since civ 2.",43.2
"oh man. have you played this in game? no? what is your problem asshat? buy this game now or you should just hang yourself. god. 10/10",175.7
"this game will leave you geeked out for dayssss. overall fun as hell!!!",267.5
"civilization v is a great game, full of enormous maps and intricate politics that will keep your intrigue sated throughout the ages that your civlization achieves. i cant exactly recommend that you play it with friends, but it can be a great game to play by yourself.",103.2
"civilization 5 is a great stragergy game for beginners and pros with previous experiences in other civ games not required. this game has a great singleplayer option but playing multiplayer with friends by far takes the cake. grab this game when it is on sale for hours of fun.",15.5
"the continuation of sid meiers renowned turn based strategy game series civilization sees substantial changes from the mechanics to which veterans of the series are accustomed. these changes to the core workings of the game (especially the lack of religion and espionage) make it feel incomplete to those coming from a background of playing civ iii and iv. that being said, many of these issues are fixed with the gods and kings and brave new worlds expansions. so whist the default game is fundamentally flawed, the fixed (expanded) version of the game is an awesome rendition of the series and well worth a look.",152.6
"this is one of my favorite games of all time, if your looking for a game with great gameplay, awsome multiplayer, and hours upon hours of fun... buy this game!",66.1
"this game is as addictive as chocolate to a fat kid. you can play for hours on end without knowing time has even passed. it just feels good when you can completely destroy another civ after a hundred turn war. it is a long game with massive replayability. i cant play this enough. <3",31.3
"sid meiers time stealer v awesome for wasting an entire day on one game. 4/5 would recommend.",3.0
"this game is probably the most in-depth ive gotten to playing a real civilization. some of the ai is weird, but its sucked me in and takes a long time afterward to process how my civilization grew and fell.",414.2
"totally worth buying. i never played any turn-based strategy games prior to this and i always assumed they were boring. this game changed that view. i just started playing this game and so far im still playing with the bots so diplomacy is rather boring (the trades with bots is absolutely cut-throat). other than that, this is a very solid game. balancing your resource to attain victory certainly isnt easy. for whats it worth, this game is an absolute steal!",117.1
"its a great game and if you dont like it like my friend belini, then i dont respect your opinion and you can  off!",82.7
"got the basis civ for 19 euro, and goty update for 10 euro, all well worth it. game is fun as usual.",99.4
"too much dlc, the game is ok but theres no focus on a concrete line, the game without dlc is trolled incomplete!",112.5
"this game is an awesome constant time sink and one of my favorite games that i have played. many nights have been spent fighting friends over and over!",171.0
"ghandi nuked the world...and i neve invented the wheel.",45.3
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",51.1
"such an addictive game with so much playability. i definitly recommend this game",36.3
"it is just to good! i bought it last weekend and already have 30 hours in it. if u can buy this game",184.0
"feeling as though i am in a time portal with this game start playing at 8 in the evening and finish at 10am. could of sworn i was only at the game for an hour!!!",89.7
"very good game. highly reccommended for fans of strategy and history. theres nothing like building the pyramids and great wall in rome. very difficult strategy. i am not able to win a game on any difficulty over prince (normal). definitely worth the cost as it will occupy you for many months.",209.7
"awesome game, although very slow at some stages. it does take a long time to research some techs and create some units, not recommended if you just want a quick game and not wait 3 days to nuke the bloody egyptians",112.9
"trully an astonishing work of art. great graphics and the gameplay is just spectalur! america approves this game for children under the age of 3 :)",146.8
"they make it easy to mod the game with built in search tools to browse mods guess that is why i have 600+ hours logged in... 750 hours and counting and with the expansions it is like a whole new game",789.7
"this game is a life-stealing time-sink. i come back to this game again and again. it is very satisfying to win.",75.7
"stab the ottoman, stab the american, stab the chinese, man it dont matter. in this game you can stab anyone if you get your stabbing points researched enough. easily the best stabbing simulator of the decade.",46.5
"this is the first civilization game that i have ever played and i was pleasantly surprised. to put it short, it is amazing. a multitude of different play styles are supported and the variety of maps, game size, and online aspects make this game very replayable. the only gripe i have on the game is that units are not stackable, however that is very forgiveable when looking at everything this game does right. 9/10",37.1
"the main reason i didnt reach my potential in school. 4/20 blaze it.",20.3
"i started playing it was day time when i finished playing it was dark outside sun where did you go?",11.9
"one more turn and im done for now ..... 6 hours later",63.6
"although i havent gone through the game fully, it already is great. those who enjoy running civilization and strategy this game is for you. not as nice to total war, the civilization series has many great games including this one. ive played civilization revolution for my ps3 and felt confined, i forgot i bought this game, so i saw it and started it up, already feeling the same i gave it a few minutes, which became hours and it became addicting, but fun :d. the create game setup is a bit elaborate but navigable. play as many leaders from around the world from washington to napoleon, beijing to moscow, your choices will have a lasting impact and you must find a way to victory, as there are multiple ways. see you on the virtual globe!",81.4
"mah a mah a mah mothering a, yeah i recommend this . buy it or some crap like that, dont torrent #torrentsnot4me",55.4
"hugely addictive. seriously strategic. power-mongering. epic. gear up and put your big-boy pants on; this is the thinking mans (and womans) war game. beautifully rendered graphics, intelligent ai and well thought out civilizations. this game has so much depth and variety; every game is different. you can also adjust the difficulty of each game, great for beginners, which lets you work your way through the miriad of strategies available to each cvilization you take out to play with. warning: dont attempt to play this game before going to bed.",260.9
"great game. makes you think. lets you have fun. i recommend this game for anybody who likes strategic games, anybody in general. even if you dont like strategic games, at least give this game a couple goes.",12.0
"just bought this game on sale cause i got addicted after playing the demo a few friends warned me about the dangerous path that lies ahead....they warned me about the one they call gandhi the destroyer of worlds, i shrugged it off an started my conquest. i was about 10 turns into my game when the balded headed messiah came to waving a white flag of peace. i stupidly accepted an was soon deceived, because a few turns later he delcared war with me an killed me. turns out that flag was a bunch of lies an deception. 10/10 would be deceived again",8.9
"buy this, quit drugs. most addictive game i have ever played. absoluetly the best strategy game out there. 10/10",290.0
"you have been warned, one more turn ends up becoming a few hundred more...",1044.1
"this one of the best games ive played. i would recommend completely as long as you are okay with the small consequence of your life being consumed by its amazingness.",191.6
"fantastic game, better with the expansions. so fun to play.",145.0
"great game. has a really steep learning curve at first but is lots of fun. every game is different as well which is awsome",33.7
"great turn-based game, although bit can be a little slow at times.",35.7
"civ 5 is extremely fun, and even a little educational as it mirrors how real-life affiars in the world could go down.",26.0
"it is a really great game and i love it but i was looking at dlcs and i found the packet for 50$ (american) and i got so mad at myself because i realized that there was the packet i could have bought instead so pretty much wasted 30 dollars on the basic game when i could have bought the packet. so this is more to the owners of steam to make something where you can return a game and get your money back. if there is please email me to tell me where it is so i can get the packet instead of buying the packet on top of the basic game i have already downloaded. please",87.7
"this game is amazing! you may have seen sid meiers civization beyond earth. i still recommend this game rather than that because there as been more work on it than the new one. if you buy this game you will want to buy all of the exspansions for it. the exspansions exspand the game so much, the base game is not near as fun as all of the exspansions combined. i really would reccomend this game. i play with my uncle all of the time and we kill each otheror work together, and not even talking about all of the fun of smack talk! this game is amazing to play and even better playing with freinds and family. if you buy this game make sure to get someone you know to play with you. also make sure to practice so much that you crush whoever you play with in an istant, this game lets you achive complete and utter power. buy this game.",501.3
"this game is so sick. i have 170+ hours on this game. its beautilful to see your own civilization grow and it makes you appreciate the finer things like how other rulers can be backstabing s who will let you have pearls for 30 turns for you wine, bannanas, citrus, copper, iron, and 300 gold then to suddenly launch a preemptive strike on krakow, you most prized city and the wheat capital for all civs. a word of warning for those who i have convinced to get the game, montezuma does not wear pants. when you meet him, tell him pat sent ya. and if he tells you to settle your cities elsewhere, tell him to put on some pants.",278.8
"the best of the civ series... and with each new expansion it gets better and better! 10/10!",300.2
"great leave me alone im in my own world for 5 hours type game... once you hit next turn you dont realize youve been playing for the next 100 turns lol... only gripe is if you play a huge map the game will begin to freeze once you approach the modern era & thats when all the real fun starts. still.. 5 stars from the strategy lover",903.0
"i recommend this game to people who enjoy games similar to sim city or age of empires. that is all.",15.1
"this game is simply a must have for all people who have steam.",269.6
"always fun. can put it down and pick it up whenever and ill have a good time",43.0
"i secound the people who say just one more turn... but be wary, it might not work 100% of the time (but it does work)",206.0
"this game is so much better than beyond earth! beyond earth isnt that great of a game like this one, my favourite thing about this game is that you go up in ages from a round wheel to space age, but beyond earth its all in the same age with only technological upgrades and the units you get.. well lets just say theres not a lot. prefer this game 10 out of 10 than beyond earth! well lets just wait, the game was only recently released hoefully they will put in a lot more dlc into the game to make it more fun, at least put in more units than just the basic ones. still have no idea how to use the jets yet so complicated or maybe its just glitched out because i cant make them move any where around the map or to hover/guard a tile",13.5
"awesome turn-based strategy with loads of dlc, definetely one worth playing!",223.7
"ever think of what would happen if ghanghi wanted to blow up the world? ever want to pit germany agains egypt? ever wanna make it so the azteks won the space race? well look no further, all this and more can be done in game, not to mention the mod community if massive, to the point of having msf and madoka duke it out over the worlds water. but i digress, this is a great game.",95.1
"if you have the time for this game its surpringly fun and replayable. matches can take a while but its definately worth picking up.",66.3
"on a scale of 1 to 10 on the nuke-happy scale, gandhi is literally a 12, literally",69.4
"love this game! you will need both expansions to truly appreciate it. the gods and kings expansion added quite a bit to game play but with the latest expansion brave new world, more elements have been included such as trade routes, tourism, etc. that enhance the game even more. all that being said, diplomacy is still poorly executed in the game so beware of this negative aspect and enjoy what is a very good, if not excellent (4x) tbs game.",982.7
"great game very easy to sink several hours into it without even realizing it",299.6
"addictive and can be as complex or simple as you want, with help from the plethora of mods out there.",336.1
"so many hours of my life wasted in the game... incredibly addicting, but not once could i last long enough to the end of a game. its a lot more fun starting out than it is late game imo.",225.5
"this game makes my manties moist. if you dont own this, castrate yourself.",535.4
"its a very in-depth strategy, and tactics game with a lot of different possible outcomes, the most common one being world wars and nukes and sieges. it takes a little while to get used to, but when you do, its amazing. overall id rate it a 9.5 out of 10. the only thing keeping it out of a perfect 10 is for me it takes forever to join multiplayer lobbies. otherwise its a superb investment.",407.3
"one of the most addicting games ive ever played. countless hours of fun, and even better in multiplayer.",159.8
"this game is awsome! if you like me waited a very long time before buying it, wait no longer! this is a masterpiece.",53.0
"perfect installment of a great series. also like the amount of options and classic features they tried to maintain in all the elements of the game.",310.4
"ive played them all (civ i through this one) and i like civ v the best *now* with the additional expansions. the hex-based map is much better for realistic environments and movement. single unit stacking is also much better - no more soak-off attacks (where you have a stack of spearmen with one modern armor and the enemy kills off your spearmen one at a time while your armor remains unharmed.) it also makes upgrading your military units important because now it matters if you are holding a mountain pass with a single legion versus using a rifleman unit. beyond combat there are a lot of nice additions with diplomacy, religion, and civics that give you more ways to play and win (replayability is very important to me.)",82.1
"the game is very addicting and with the expansion of a brave new world the dimension of influence and economy add a lot to the gameplay, whereas before diplomacy was much harder. especially, considering the erratic ais.",197.7
"i cannot even begin to describe how good this game is. download the demo and see for yourself. i played the demo many times through before i bought the game.",98.5
"amazing installment. in my youth i spent nights playing civ iii but that game had many disadvantages, the worst of them were awful faces of leaders :) but civ v conquered my heart instantly after my wife showed it to me. totally worth the money i paid (1000 rub on sale for full pack), many hours of gameplay including multiplayer, interesting achievements, full civilopedia manual. highly recommended for all fans of turn-based strategies (i am a big fan of homm series too).",78.0
"complex strategy play to keep things interesting with some new (to me) options to enhance gameplay like espionage. overall a great game, easy to get lost for hours at a time.",110.9
"civilisation is a epic stratergy game forcing one to use their wits against other in the race for supremecy",46.7
"great game i have tons of hours on it. the only thing i have to say bad about the game are the countless nights i have lost sleep over just because i couldnt put the thing down. tons of interesting civilizations to play as and the maps are always stunning and 100% unique. the multiplayer can take a long time to find a match unless you have a preplanned thing with friends which is were you probably get the best multiplayer experience anyway. not any bugs that i have run into frequently especially in the single player which is polished to perfection. any strategy fan could easily get lost in this game play for hours on end. on top of that all the dlc add a whole new dimenson to the game. buy it you wont regret it.",755.8
"this is a game that takes time but still addictive i cant stop playing this game its simple it includes steam workshop and multiplayer get it now",100.2
"this is an awesome game. after playing since civ 3 all the way to civ 5 each one expanded the depth of the game becoming more realistic. now trying out civ beyond earth.. the game makes you think and will take up your free time.",595.1
"i think this is one of the best strategy games ever.it becomes much more better with the expansions.",92.3
"this is a game that will entertain you and you will never want to stop. i recomend this to anyone who like openworld and the civilization series",39.6
"im always resisted playing games like civ because i used to think they where boring or not enough action. man was a wrong, i love this game and it has risen quickly to my top 3 favorite games.",229.4
"built the eiffel tower in sparta, then found oil and the usa declared war on me. only 50% accurate. 5/10",15.0
"a board game that could only exist as a video game, with an immense amount of depth. its easy to play and almost impossible to master, and its a different game every time you play it. pick up both major dlcs (brave new world and gods and kings) for the best possible experience.",73.6
"ive played this game so much that i feel obliged to make a review of it. civ v is absolotely amazing. its the best strategy game ive ever played. if youre new to civ, start with this game. this game, plus expansion packs and mods, is one of the best gaming experiences ive ever had. if you want recommended mods, message me. once you start playing, you wont be able to stop.",595.2
"great game! ai either too weak or to strong sometimes",146.4
"civilization 5 is very time consuming, but a fun game even the less. i can recommend this game to people who like strategy games based on board games like risk. there is not as much action as in other strategy games, but theyve improved the combat part since the last game.",43.5
"just one...more...turn... one of the best strategy games i have ever played!",194.2
"i cant stop... this games a tad bit too addicting. you can win with science. yay...",52.3
"great historical turn based strategy game, recommend if you like this genre.",62.3
"if you have 1 day to live, dont play civ v. it will take those 24 hours and crush them, there is no game more addicting than this",181.4
"sid meier does it again with civlization v, all of the realist styled game play you ever wanted to simulate during the cold war. this time with deeper running, espionage, tech tree, religion, and hex combat!",97.0
"get this game. even if youre not into strategy games, theres something youll enjoy here. its addictive. this and civ 3 are the only games ive played recently where i completely lost track of time for hours on end. theres always something for you to do, and if you somehow get bored with the base game, there are lots of mods for it that add new units, civilizations, scenarios, and even total conversions for various fictional universes, like the future mod and the middle earth mod. at $12.50, its definitely worth it.",134.7
"must more than addictive. i find myselfe always saying just one more turn, this is most times 5 hours later. great game. i definately recommend this. also get the complete edition.",16.6
"sid meiers civ 5 is a great game for people who enjoy playing strategy games and trying to out play their opponents while the multiplayer is a bit glitchy at times with large amounts of people its still very enjoyable to be a part of all in all the game is very worthwhile to play or at least check out.",212.4
"its really good, despite it being a turn type of game, it is very fun and addicting to play <3 especially with friends",300.7
"backstabbing political simulator a must buy. 10/10 would play again",201.9
"i was nuked by ghandi and i have never laughed more in my life",216.3
"ghandi pointed a nuke at me and told me to rate this game good. 10/10, would nuke again.",67.4
"while it isnt my favorite game (in the sense that ive played other games more and like to play them more, not that i dislike this game) it is definitely up there on the list. its indefinitely replayable, so that adds to the value of it as well. its fun enough that if you like this type of game, youll probably get caught up enough in it that youll end up playing for hours and hours and realize the sun is going down (or coming up haha). but if you want my opinion, if this game is on sale or something, there really isnt any reason not to buy it at this point.",235.3
"great game, but it has taken over my life! i just cant put it down.",86.3
"it is a fun and great game if you like stratigic games i would recommend it for all strategy players",66.9
"buy this game if you have nothing to live for and you want to ruin your life",63.0
"it took the dlc to make a good game great, but it finally got there. the king of turn-based strategy games. just one more turn.",172.6
"this is the greatest strategy game out there, as far as im concerned.",145.5
"best strategy game i played so far and very adictive. i would recommend to people who love this type of game.",174.7
"you may have heard jokes regarding this game and its ilk that go something along the lines of just one more turn oh hey its 6am. you are mistaken. those are not jokes.",64.9
"while the earlier civs probably sucked more of my time, this one is the best - especially the combat makes a lot more sense, and hexagonal movement is a welcome addition.",55.7
"this game has been immeasurably improved by its expansions and is absolutely worth getting",218.0
"i have 47 hours in this game and i still dont know how it works. but i just... cant... stop.",47.8
"it feels like i just lost 20 hours overnight, and i loved every second. ready for another go and its only been a few days. this is addiction.",27.2

"by far the best of the civilization games, as an old civ 2 player i found civ 5 to have everything i missed in the old masterpiece. civ 5 delivers like civ 3 and 4 with their strange game builds never did. interesting battles, no more tech-stealing from city captures, government talent trees instead of simply chosing a government, etc. the tech-tree can seem a bit short though, and the ai make misstakes in battles, but a modifiable game pace and multiplayer solves those issues.",518.7

"if you are looking for a stratagy game this is the one, great gameplay and graphics make this perfect for any stratagy fan. although many many mid to late game units are semi useless, looking at you tanks, but aside from a few minor oversights it is a well balanced srtatagy game that i would recommend to any friend. also if you plan to buy this game dont buy it on steam go to target and buy the game of the year edition, it comes with alot of the dlc for less money.",6.2
"gamer is so good it makes you punch your own face.",123.8
"civilization 5 is a solid game. it looks and feels a lot like an expanded digital version of the board game called the settlers of catan. yet it must be said that there really isnt much depth to the gameplay. even though you have a lot of freedom to customize your experience to your liking. at the end of the day, civilization 5 really seems shallow and almost childish compared to the vast depth and immersion of different paradox games. games such as europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2.",43.9
"this game will take hundreds of hours out of your life, but every minute is endlessly rewarding. conquer the world with an iron fist, or use knowledge and dipolmacy and change the world for the better. try this game.",18.1

"i recommend civilization 5 for the players who arent able to quite play squad based games like coh2, and want an easier path than the total war series. its more relaxing, simpler. i have alot of hours on the game and i do find it can be difficult, but it is also a very calming game when you are experiencing the rage of failing other games due to cheese. multiplayer with friends is fantastic, would highly recommend to buy this and play with friends.",394.2
"like turn-based strategy games but had enough of those old and  graphics? get civ v. plays as awesome as civ iii!",33.6
"the pros are (as always with the civ series) the accessibility, sense of progression, and subconsciously creating a narrative with each new game. the biggest flaw in civ 4 makes a return in civ 5...the ai. the ai simply isnt good enough at playing the game, so the challenge has to come from the player being statistically handicapped (or playing online). at least one other 4x game enjoys a big advantage when it comes to the ai.",333.6

"this game is honestly my favourite out of all the games ive played so far. as you can see ive logged 120 hours and plan to log even more with the bnw expansion pack that im getting. the graphics are still awesome and i still get chills every time i nuke a enemy city :d",133.9
"sid meiers civilization v is one of the best turn-based strategy games. there are many hours of fun to be had in this with this game, it can bring out the competitive side in you.

"whether civilization v is better than iv is a debate that has raged on for many years. in my own opinion, this game is the superior of the two, mostly due to the expansions. yes, it sucks to no longer have to worry about the health of your cities, and golden ages happen far too frequently, but at the same time, the combat and movement systems are far improved, and you wont have to worry about having massive stacks of hundreds of units just to have an effective military. if youre new to civ, this game is the best choice for you, but if youve been playing civ for a long time, iv might be more up your alley.",117.3

"as a huge civ 4 fan, i recommend sid meiers civilization v if you want to take this franchise to the next level. the graphics are far more beautiful, the soundtrack more inspiring and certain game elements, such as hex-based grid, let you strategize in new fulfilling ways. i also like that the leaders are voiced in their native languages, what i dont like is how time-consuming this game can be. seriously, civ 5 has the power to keep you enthralled for hours on end. it really is that good. one other thing, low-end machines can run the game in direct x 9, which is great if you dont have a powerful monster at your side :)",20.0
"i am a big civ fan and have enjoyed all the previous versions. this version how ever i think is one of the best ones of the series. its very nice graphics go well with the wonderful music. the game can be very overwelming to people who have never played civ, thankfully civ 5 has a very in depth civ advisors that can help you get use to this game. from complete new people to the series or people who have only played a little civ. this game is a must have. you will be drawn into the game in just a few minutes.",156.8

"civ v is...a very good game. if you were a fan of iv then i defnately reccommend purchasing it. however, the expansion packs are really what boosts this game. especially gods and kings, the way you can make religions and make your civ benefit from this, whilst in bnw it expands the trading side and also a little on the culture victory. i strongly suggest picking it up in the sale for around 10 pounds, or if you can, go straight for gold edition upgrade. reason being that 20 pounds for this game, ontop of another 40 from the expansions is absolutely rediculous. its certainly not worth that kind of money. so, if your a strategical genius, a fan of the previous games or just wanting something to do with friendsi reccommend. only if in sale",122.3
"civ has always been a game i have found complex to pick up and try. i tried civ iii a while back and didnt get deep into it without feeling lost and gave up. as hesitant as i was to pick up civ v im glad i did. im a big rts fan, so i was worried about the pace of this game. needless to say, i love this game. so many civs to play as, it just adds to the replay value to me. its fun from start to finish, from no tech to full tech. if youve never given this game or any of the civ games a try but youre into strategy, i cannot recommend this game enough. lots of fun. and now im craving to play it. i hope youre happy.",353.6

( go from ancient era to future when total war games usually focus on 1 period of time ) great game with or without friends, but id say you get the most out of it with friends. for me this is the best strategy game ive ever played.",81.9

"this is my favorite game i have 100+ hours played. you can not go wrong with this game the hex grid is a very good choice for this game. a thing people dont like is the one unit per tile, but peronoally i like it because it leads to more stratigic play. you at no point need to go to war but it works well. if i were to have one critisisam it would be that taking cities is very unprofitable as it reduces the cities streanth significantly. other than that this game seems very solid and good.",280.2
"this game is possibly my favorite pc game to play. ive spent literally days on this game. it may seem a bit complicated at first, but its really easy after you play it for a bit. even after youve played it for a long time, there are enough civilizations and maps to choose from that this game can always seem fresh and new. i especially enjoy the multiplayer aspects. essentially, you play through each game as a civilization of your choosing and try to make your civilization last for the entire game. you can set rules such as how long the game lasts, what ways you can win, and what specials each player is allowed to have. my friend and i have played countless matches against each other. i highly recommend this game to anyone interested in strategy games.",124.7

"great game, always loved civ games. i was very glad to see civ5 beeing released on linux. it worked great for a few months, however recently the game started crashing while playing and that is a pitty. crashes are not very common maybe every 2 - 3 hours. neverless it would be great if it would not crash at all :)",402.8
"a much more welcoming civilization game and frankly found it more fun in this that civ iv. rather than remaking civ iv than, this civ game has its own identity with a overhauled (and significantly better) combat, completely unique civilizations and a different winning conditions especially with bnw. my problems with this are: *the modding, is not as flexible as its predesscecors *those freaking load times are long and show up everywhere even in the menus. *the diplomacy is really barebones such as not being able to see what others civs think of others",61.9
"what can i say about the best turn based strategy series? multi-touch support rocks, hex tiles are great. its as great as previous versions, offering huge civiliopedia to teach you actual history, stealing your precious life with never ending one more turns. your average strategy game ends in 1 hour, while civilization might not end in months. not everyone can play this game, can you build an empire to stand the test of time?",266.7

"ive invested alot of time into this game worth it yes it has alot of different play styles and other civs especially on harder difficultys one of my top 5 games only thing i could put down about this is some of the starts are awfull and the crash bug i experience after around 80-85 turns of playing overall good :)",154.2
"fantastic, watch the hours of your life wash away before your eyes as another classic civ sucks you in. even better with gods & kings.",289.7

"recommend dont critisize until youve played it good overhead strategy game which involves planning and thinking ahead of the game. graphics are fairly good for a game of this genre. there are a few bugs (mainly on multiplayer) none too noticable.. i cant go in full depth personally since i dont have a great amount of hours playing. have fun.",35.4

"beautiful and intrigiung game. highly recomend for all audiences.",40.4
"this game is amazing turn-based game, the graphics are amazing. lag is minimal plus, with dlc you have even more possibilities. the game is a challenging game from playing as the ancient egyptians to the great united states you have hours of gameplay ahead of you. so what are you waiting for buy the game and stop watching me talk about how good it is. flynn approves! 9/10",103.8

"as a poor guy, i tend to make sure all my purchases are durable. anything i put money into should theoretically last me as long as possible. i bought this game in the summer sale two years ago, and after many hours of playing, i can assure you, civ 5 is a durable game. i love replay value and, in my humble opinion, this game has replay value in spades. i have taken long breaks, but thankfully firaxis has been good about dlc and updates to keep the game fresh and me coming back. i love this game.",266.7

"one of the most addicting games from one of the most addicting franchises ever.",119.6
"vary solid game but ends up dragging on in the latter stages of the game plus it seems majority of all the ai civs are overly aggressive and science victory feels the only way to go. 8.5/10 would bang",177.7
"this game (as you can probably tell by how much ive played it) is quite addicting. its beginner friendly but still has advanced aspects for more experienced players. the major downside is that if you only buy the base game, its quite repetitive; i recommend to purchase the complete edition. the game also has a workshop, which adds more variety to the game. i once used a mod which spawned all the civilizations in true geographical areas which actually taught me some true locations of countries which i didnt previously know. overall, good game, 10/10, could ruin your life :)",347.1
"pretty much the single most addictive game of all time. you end up saying just a few more turns, next thing you know 10 hours have passed and you are late for work. this game should come with a surgeon generals warning.",387.9

"really good game, highly reccomend getting all the dlcs, and playing with some friends!",77.8
"highly reccomend to any civillization fan. a little different than previous expansions but it adds a lot more complexity and fun. just one more turn.... one more turn...",101.9
"i love this game, great for if you like rome total war and turn based game good fun to play with mates as well!",47.4

"a great way to get bollocked by ghandi and bollock others as ghandi.",22.7
"holy ing ! why are we not funding this?!?!?!?!?!?!?1",108.6
"one of the best games ever. very complex and elaborated, as civ always was. various settings, random maps, scenarios and expansions round it up to have no game like the other. quite a lot workshop mods and dlcs let you modify even more aspects so it wont get boring. it even teaches you some real history while you write your own. only bad thing is that it needs a lot of time to calculate next round if you have a lot of opponents, depending on your hardware. must-have if you like strategy games.",409.5
"one more turn my . seriously do not think you are going to just quickly make a few turns in this game and go. i once started playing at 8am thinking eh, ill play a little bit. and next thing i know it was 2pm and i was slaughtering the japanese mercilessly. this game will cause you to get fired, fail your classes, get a divorce, and nuke ghandi all at the same time. i am serious here, the commercials for this game do not lie and i have been apart of a civ 5 recovery group for a few weeks now. 15/10 would buy again.",179.9

"excellent game! totally worth the money, intricate while simple 10/10",198.5
"definatly an upgrade for the series, having seen the issues that civ 4 had with balancing. this game really updates the classic franchise with detailed visuals, a clean art style and much smoother animations during the combat. speaking of which the combat has also been improved with no more stacking units on tiles (meaning that you dont end up having an entire army crammed into a single segment) making placement of your units much more important. i havent really found anything to complain about its a good solid addition to the series. would reccomend, especially with freinds.",38.4
"i discovered the internet before computers. ive invented tanks before the proper use of oil, and ive been nuked by the ethiopian army. this was all in one playthrough. i highly reccomend this title.",100.9
"this is so much fun. even for a turn-base-game i got hooked on it ,and im not a fan of turn-base-games. it is like risk and age of emipers ,or risk and command and conquer. can you make a civilization that can live or die? will you make peace or die? the world is in your hands. what will you do?",108.6
"this game sucks you in. like a black hole. a giant, scary black hole. youll be wondering at the end of the night how several hours have passed so quickly...",60.5

"the only game where i can shoot down jets with arrows and destroy tanks with spears. 10/10",127.0
"civilization series were always the most addicting, difficult and rewarding games ever. civilization 5, alone or with gods and kings & brave new world is the most time consuming devil that posses your time and will never give it back. although your only way to resist is to click next turn and bring glory to your civilization. most complex game with many victory types, strategies, difficulty levels (from easiest for even strategy noobies to most experienced generales who were raised with rts by their sides), units, resources, everything... this game has everything that us - nerds love. and you can read a book in one time while playing on huge map around atomic era :d",175.3
"i absolutely love this game. my favorite turn based strategy game hands down. will be amazing once the steam controller is released. i like the depth and customizability of this game, and the workshop support is a godsend. really fun game to play with friends, i cant imagine the online being that much fun, but lets be honest, people only ever play this with their friends. i love this game and i love how complex and strategic the battles are. the only tedius thing about the game is tending to all of your 150 units every single turn... aside from that, the game is practically flawless. i highly recommend this game! 10/10",90.9
"i prefer the total war series but this is pretty good.",31.4
"addictive and interesting strategy game. although ive heard that it only started to bloom after the release of the brave new world. only downside is the lack of a campaign and a scarce selection of scenarios. multiplayer is easily the greatest though.",202.9
"if you are like most civilization addicts, your story began innocently enough way back in 1991 with the discovery of sid meiers civilization by firaxis games. the original civ, as its called on the streets, and its two subsequent sequels, ii and iii, allowed you to create or conquer vast civilizations-from the dawn of man to the space age and beyond. the unique turn-based strategy game quickly became the game of choice for gamers around the world. for some, however, it became more than that...it became an addiction.",56.0
"a brilliant strategy game. it and its dlc makes you feel like you are controlling an empire from its birth until its victory of the world or untimely demise. its realistic in the aspects of trade routes and the ability to backstab other players and break promises (remember hitler and czechoslovakia) i personally loved pretending to be weak and then anally annihilating anyone who tried to invade. it was a beautiful feeling.",65.5
"this game is a well made strategy game.its well worth the money to purchase this game if you like to try out the variety in civilizations to play as or if you like to play competetive.a list of pros and cons. pros: random map generator good engine ability to select what era you start in players normally always on multiplayer lots of dlc content during steam sales its cheap cons: mod button not on mac unless you edit the game files without dlc its bland sometimes it takes too long for something. overall the game gets a 7.9/10",398.5

"lets be honest. who doesnt like destroying other countries and taking over the world? huh?",95.4
"the joy this game has brought me is pretty much unlimited. i can say my grad work and home projects have been neglected mutliple times because i got knee deep in a new campaign. addicting game with lots of awesome game mechanics. i dont play as much anymore mainly because i dont have the time but whenever i get a spare moment, i hop on to play for as long as i possibly can. love this game!",5.6

"i love all the civ series, and this is just a jewel. great graphics, great improvements with all the dlc and patches. worth every penny.",32.8
"oh hell yes! this game will consume your life, but youll love every damn second of it",141.7
"fun turn based strategy game. single player is good with quite a few difficulty levels but the multiplayer is poorly optomized so crashes and lags a lot.",256.7
"this game behaves just like women do: you have to wait for ages, and when it comes to multiplayer-action; the answer is no.",23.2
"is awsome i have played 223.6 hours and is still fun",267.4
"some major changes, but i like them. way more strategic than just creating an epic stack and steamrolling the map. gods and kings dlc adds religion, and a few other parts of ai have had some updates. my only complaint is how dlc crazy they went this time. i would much rather have 1 or 2 substantial dlcs than 20 little ones, and then another that costs nearly $30 but only includes elements that probably could/should have been in the original release.",67.1
"i recommend this it is a very fun and exciting strategy game with lots to think about while in-game.",2.2

"after initially being impatient to play the civilization game series when i played iii for a bit, i regret that decision, because i was too impatient to play what would of been one of my most favourite strategy games. i got this game from the recent humble bundle, and i got to say after playing a good 6 hours on this game, that it is one of my most favourite games to play. there is ghandi who is an , dont trust him, he lies and nukes you in the back when you least expect it. nothing else i should say here other than: 10/10 get it now and ruin your life with this addiction.",143.7
"civilization v is probably one of the best games out there, its fun and theres always something knew that you learn everytime you play. i had all civs before this one and i never get tired from playing. i recommend to buy it and try it out you will like it.",133.9
"8/10 as long as you dont go into this game expecting something other than a good, polished clone, then youll enjoy this one. the scenarios are frankly kind of slow and unrewarding but the basic single player and multiplayer is very good.",154.6
"i give this a 9.5 out of 10. everything is perfect excluding how peaceful and friendly civilizations are. it has sucked what remained of my soul that reddit left behind, and now there is only emptiness. this game kicks !",360.2

"this game look very good, indeed, i like the complex of each turn, unique and interesting. i can not get out of this just....one...more...turn",95.2
"this game is really fun to play but you get the most out of it when its multiplayer. unfortunatly a lot of people play with dlcs so you cant join unless you have them.",113.7
"great game all around. i love the massive variety when it comes to playing with so many civilizations to choose from and plenty of different ways to play and win. my biggest thumbs up goes to the fact that besides barbarians you dont have any set enemies who will attack you unlike most strategy games ive played. its all about diplomacy when it comes to other civilizations and thats a plus for me.",75.0
"i am addicted to this game and love playing it. the combat is turn based but i love it anyway and i cant get over the city building idea. i enjoy the easy setup for multi-player and play regularly. the race for the wonder is amazing when all your friends are rushing the same wonder and well all finish at the same time, but wait he just got more production points hes going to win. this game is for all ages above 10 and is always great for multi-person games. i recomend to all civ building fans out there and even if you are not one yet. pass on the recomendations to your friends and families! have fun ;) i would rate this ****** (6) stars",124.5

"damn this game is consuming, its like skyrim all over again! :d",611.9
"this game is like if your high school world history teacher gave you an ounce of meth for every class you attended. youre getting a good high and learning stuff about history, but in a practical long terms sense youre merely a slighty intelligable junkie.",209.0
"its really a fantastic game, it was my first time playing civilization. i was really surpirised about the graphics, how everything loogs so random but at teh same time it is very strategic. really recommand the game to other people.",173.0
"10/10 my nation america surived for centuries along side of my friend russia. we were wiping out the remenants of the arabs when all of a sudden my dear friend, the only person i trusted betrayed me. as sad as i was about this happening, i could only blame myself for being a gullible too trusting person. would play, and buy again if i had to. great game",52.0
"this game is probably my favourite game of all time. playing it alone is great, but playing it with your friends is amazing. not many games can give the civ v feel of backstabbing your friends and taking over their cities.",116.2

"the best strategy game ever played. great on multiplayer, great on single player, i recommend definately giving it a try at least.",621.7

"a epic game! the game is hard and takes skill to play. if you lied games like master of orion, this game is like that just a different theme, based on human history, and more in depth. i have played countless hours of this game and do not understand the gripes with this game. civilization was made for gameplay not graphics. about the only gripe i do have is that the game does get kinda laggy as there are a lot of big civilizations, but it is not that big of a deal. this is because it takes longer for the computer to think about what moves to make. be prepared to spend many many hours playing civilization each game takes many hours to finish. but it is fun and addictive. i do not have the brave new world expansion, but those i know who do have it say it is great. i do however have gods and kings",170.8
"great game so differnt empires so many differnt so many ways to play your game could turn around with deal that was not thought through",60.4

"very fun, very addictive, though ive only played the game with the brave new world expansion pack added, which apparently makes it a whole lot better than vanilla, according to some friends. grabbing both together can set you back a pretty penny so if youre interested, id recommend picking this one up when its on sale. its a great blend of peaceful and tense that really keeps you in the game, be it leaning back in your chair or on the edge of it.",418.6
"bloody brilliant. the mods make this game even better, theres nothing quite like playing as the soviet union and crushing the us after a 3000 year cold war.",120.7

"one of the single best strategy games ever made. people who dont normally play strategy games are even gonna like this one. this game is incredibly addictive, and you will undoubtedly be sinking an outrageous amount of hours into it if you actually play it. finishing just one game, even if small, can take a minimum of 8 hours. and if you decide to max out the game and make it huge, then days. theres no other game where you can say you nuked gandhi and went to war with george washington and took over america. this game is truly one of the best strategy games ive played and one of the best games in general. 10/10",108.1

"although turn based strategy games are not everyones cup of tea, this critically aclaimed edition to the civilization franchise is a detailed and intracite game that once learned is extremely addicting. although it is pricey, once a steam sale rolls around it can be as much as 75% off. it is a must have for anyone looking for a new game to sink hundreds of hours into.",567.0

"the game was disapointing because it was not as good as civ 4 (or any of the previous civ games) out of the box so i recommend you buy any of those instead. the problem is that the base game is incomplete and dull. essentially it is civ 1 with fancy graphics but without the coolest feature (being able to build a palace if your people love you). the dlcs which may restore some of the features of civ 4 should have formed part of general patching so i refuse to buy them since they are also stupidly expensive for what they appear to offer. i uninstalled it afte a few days and if i ever feel like a bout of world domination i dig out my copy of civ 4 over this.",72.6

"a fantastically polished example of the turn-based strategy genre. it evokes a similar feeling to the call to power spin-offs, which i like a lot. its also a very addictive game: if minecraft has gamers saying just one more block for hours on end, then the equivalent civ 5 addict would utter just one more turn again and again. all in all, if you like turn-based strategy, theres little here to dislike. just be wary of gandhis nuclear strike program.",431.4

"this game is woderful with many unique features like the evolution of technology, the ability to dictate many asprcts of your civilizaion, and more. with all of these positive aspects, there must be terrible ones. the worst part of the game is the multiplayer; no kicking, no real private games, and a few bugs here and there. overall however, this game is a wonderful addition to anyones gaming collection for its enjoyable gameplay and a twist to the classic strategy game genre.",242.8

"i have been playing civ since the first dos version and i own every iteration of the game since, including now - beyond earth. civ for me is the gamers game - like chess - its open ended, always different, challenging and educational too ! - the interface is stunning. this is the only game that has kept me up all night long to day break - where still i just have to click - one - more - time .......",229.5
"fantastic game, great amount of strategy, however the ai is ballistic and not very good, capping out in a difficulty at king, and just getting cheap starts at any difficulty higher. with that said, the game is still absolutely fantastic, and you can spend dozens of hours just going through a couple of turns, making decisions, trading, and managing your city to make it as customizable as you want it to be.",62.5
"i can spend way to much time on this game and have!",379.7
"this game is fun. you should buy it so i can get my  kicked by you too. im getting tired of death threats from just ghandi.",3.0
"i really liked this game. i struggle with it, but enjoy it. thats life i guess :$",78.9
"very good but i reccomend you get the collection pack with it as it gets fairly old after a few hours with no dlc",59.8
"my favorite strategy game. extremely fun if you like history too.",47.9
"reminds me of the total war series. but better. without the rts aspect.",253.1
"civ 5 is one of those games where you look at the clock, and 6 hours have passed. a game where you will stay on for one more turn 10/10 would buy again",116.3
"its always one more turn and before you know it 4 hours have passed by! love this addicting game!",314.0
"for the person that wants to rewrite history from the comfort of their own home this is the game for you.",200.3
"just one more turn......kids dont know my name...just one more turn.....wife leaves me.....just one more turn...forclosure notice on the door....just one more turn...wait...what....god d@^^*% ghandi!!! better than meth. two thumbs up.",425.2
"can play this game for years at a time, no pun intended. this game does take up so much time. well worth it.",245.4
"long term playabiliy... i keep coming back to this again and again. destined to be a classic. the dlc is usually well thought out too, but not really necessary to enjoy the game. if you like strategy and war games, this is the king of the pile...",517.9
"brings politics to life between friends who is going to backstab who who will rise and who will fall its a great game amazing gameplay and graphics 10/10",120.9
"if you like turn based strategy games, then this is an absolute must have game!",79.0
"6 out of 10 great graphics. i am still learning how to play this game i havent figured it all out. it is a lot different than the old civilization games.",4.3
"how many civilizations do you think sid meier has to make before hes happy",2.1
"this game is pretty damn addicting. it certainly has its flaws: its a bit simplistic once you understand the fundamentals. but there is enough content to keep me coming back to play",264.3
"takin ovar da worls 4dayzzzz. good stuff 10/10 would give a hobo.",172.1
"this game is not for me. it lacks action and pretty graphics to captivate me. dont get me wrong i like rts games but this too much turn based. that said its a solid game if you are fan of turn based strategy.",21.0
"amazing turn based strategy game and it gives a new look on strategy",125.8
"hours and hours of screaming at the netherlands for dancing around your borders with their units or at babylon for the never-ending wave of denounciations and war declaration. desperate research to stay on top and brown-nosing to appease the city-states. frustration. blood, sweat and tears. worth it?",115.5
"multiplayer needs serious work. play delay for quiters, and game passwords",790.5
"i loved it however this is simply my kind of game. the game practically plays itself considering its turn based you only have a few decisions to make then its up to the computer. so it probably will be boring at times.",454.4
"in combination with gods and kings + brave new world, this is the best civ experience ever!",242.9
"very fun, but not sure about the mechanics, and games take a very long time; which i guess is good :)",22.4
"since everyone else is placing their reviews, and having around 30-50 hours of gametime, i figured id put my word in and close the time gap. this game is amazing, you will not regret getting it. its not a waste of time, nor is it a waste of money. this game will have you playing it over and over repeatedly. replay value? definately a lot. in fact, if you were to buy this game right now, and youve liked the gameplay videos and screenshots, im positive youd like to play the game for yourself. go ahead and buy it if its your cup of tea! its very fun, and youll enjoy yourself. :)",811.8
"unbelieveably addicting. easily one of the best civ games ever.",69.9
"for those who love strategy games this game is for you. i have played countless hours of this game. theres alot you can play around with. especially get the game with brave new world because it adds a lot more to the game.",360.3
"i nuked the aztecs as an egyptian warlord. what other game lets you do that?",60.8
"this is a fun entertaining game bilt for people that love civilization based games.",141.4
"just as addictive as i remember from when i played it on 3.5 disks on an old ibm 486 clone, with turbo. i am sure the turbo then is as about as powerful as a pocket calculator now. the graphics of course are mind blowingly improved. the rules of the game and the gameplay itself have not changed all that much. i was able to get into the game quickly. most of the modern gui is intuitive. i know what i am looking for and it takes only a guess or two to find it. i remember there were a lot of key strokes on the original version which was harder. my computer is not powerful enough to handle the graphics on full blast, but even as they are i am incredibly impressed. of course, pong was impressive at the time too...everything is relative to what you know. i still love this game and i love the graphics, sounds, interface and the experience of playing it. still, all these years later.",23.8
"indeed a great game. i wish so hard they fix soon the multiplayer performance, cause it is a delight to play with friends.",137.6
"turn based combat while building an entire empire. yes please play with any one with the game aswell. thank you. from the origional maker of the sims. great work sid. get it now and be amazed at how good a game can be if you take your time and craft an extremely rare blue, flawless diamond in the rough, a sea of b******t fps war games taking out americas enemies in the name uncle sam. get this to get away. rename queen elizabeth to seras victoria. dont be japan, be area 11 lead by zero. dont be france, be the saints lead by julius little.",191.6
"one of my favourite sagas of all the time. too addictive :-)",2.6
"this game is extremely fun and easy to get into. from bows and arrows to nuclear war, dirt roads to railroads and catapults to tanks, its fun to watch your civilzation progress. you almost feel a sense of pride watching your glorious empire rise and your enemies fall before you. you feel defeated and terrible if your grand civilaztion crumbles. this is just a great game to make your own story and alternate history. i reccomend this to everyone who likes creating your own story. 5 stars.",512.0
"although most games (within this game), start out slow, the late game is fun, and too fast. use nukes to destroy armies, and pollute your enemies lands. use killer robots to walk through people. maybe start early and use knights to destroy warriors. the game is very fast for the skilled, and very slow to the beginners. dont let that scare you though, slow beginnings only strengthen you for the quick ending, youd rather fight off.",147.8
"its a very good game. very historical civs and technologys. i recommend because i love this game.",65.2
"as much replayability as tes skyrim (witout needing any mods) this game is seirously worth the money. the game is fun, and extremely coustimizable. only downside is that the dlc is expensive",186.1
"ok so great game ive had it before and thought why not get again on steam however i was not going to pay 30$ for a game that i bought 2 years ago for the same price so while i was at game stop last night buying an xbox game for my daughter i saw civs v sitting there all alone by itsself and a big shiny price tag of 7.49$ so i figured well damn if i can buy it for that price why cant everyone else dont get me wrong the game is soo worth 30$ but why pay more going to gamestop and buying a digital copy for steam saved me 22$ just thought i would pass this info on enjoy ur games have fun",28.1
"very good game excelent replay value, i bought gold edition and it has saved me a lot of money. 9/10- to slow to start off",158.9
"civ v was the very first game i ever bought on steam. best game of all time.",475.1
"never thought any game could suck most of my life away more than tf2, boy was i wrong. 11/10 note: i recommend also getting gold and brave new world.",325.2
"just look at how many hours ive spend playing it...",639.0
"this is an amazing strategy game that you will spend hours playing and its even better with a freind it is a game worth getting.",198.5
"if you are a fan of risk or diplomacy or any of that kind of board game you will love civ. even those coming from the realms of aoe and cnc will like the relaxed but more strategic play style of a turn based strat like civ. only downside is its very long games, but if that dosent bother you, i suspect you might have found your new favourite game, if at least for a while.",87.2
"this game is magnificent. everytime i load it up i cant help but play all day. this game is one of the best strategy game so far ever created. civ vi anyone?",244.6
"for a four year old game, civ5 presents a fantastic experience on par with modern strategy games. with particular emphasis on individual turns, each game steadily develops into a robust (albeit historically inaccurate) simulation of competitive civilizations. though the learning curve might be somewhat steep, the in-game tips are helpful and generally non-intrusive. once you get the hang of the mechanics, youll be hooked. keep in mind that each game spans the history of the world and then some. so grab some friends and get comfy; this might take a while. absolutely recommend!",59.8
"ive played this game at least 20 times and never finished it. 10/10.",127.9
"i like this game so mutch because it is a strategy game where you go from ancient era to future era. i like that very mutch. there is nothing about the game that i dislikes.",182.7
"for those who played civ2 for the whole life and now trying civ5 - dont build the same amount of roads/mines and farmlands. now they cost. a lot.",41.1
"get this, and you can build a huge country within 1000 years. and then kill off a billion barbarians. and then steal other peoples monuments by building them first. and have your little men build twisty roads. and then bomb another country who keeps warning you that youre getting to close to their borders. very fun :d",335.5
"everything you have come to expect from a great 4x game. itd be nice if the ai was a bit more capable/varied, and there was some way to finish a multiplayer game in less than a month.",289.2
"yeah great game if you like stratergy. but this may be the game to get you in to stratergy",345.8
"i woke up played this game for thirty minutes, looked outside saw that it was pitch black out. apparently i had played for six days straight and now had an unending hatred for the french. 10/10",41.6
"an amazing game! spent days playing. plenty of mods available to spice things up. ultimately, my favourite game :)",649.2
"if you are looking for a good civ game, look no further. i may catch some flak for this but beyond earth really seemed to tank in ratings and reviews are not very positive and rather mixed but leaning towards negative.",98.1
"up to 399 hours of gameplay. ill finish this game any day now...",459.0
"still the best 4x series, v has the on-going refinements that makes it difficult to go back and play 1-4, though i prefer stacking units for combat. the end game is still a bit tedious, especially since the ai is still not very good at automating worker units. i still find limited thrill in non-conquest victory conditions but that may have more to do with my style of play than a deficiency in the design.",127.9
"really fun if youre into strategy games. if you can manage to find friends to play it with or just people online, the games take ages but theyre worth it.",14.3
"good game overall, a bit repetitive at times but definitely fun to play!",139.4
"i love civ 5 but the only problem i have with it is not the game its the mods. they are all for civ 5 brave new world. i saw a cool mod that brought the lord of the rings to civ 5 but it was for brave new world! i recomend people who played other civ games but for those who like mods to spice their game up i do not recomend.",49.0
"i dislike most things about this game. final boss is bugged. where is this",79.3
"this game is probably one of the best games i have ever played. never gets old! even without dlc! highly reccomended.",233.8
"great and fun game! a definate buy for the collection!",63.9
"still flaming mad about spending 13 hours on a campaign just to have the huns convince everyone to attack me. it is a great (albeit time consuming) strategy game. im interested in trying the turn by turn play. 9/10",17.7
"ing awsome game guys check it out (its prob gonna take some getting used t its different)",74.4
"endless fun, troll the cpu on settler or get your  whooped on legendary. its all your choice, i could play this all day! and i have",94.5
"as addicting to me as civ 2 was back in college. i think about it, i dream about it, and i totally dont trust napoleon.",30.6
"gandhi approached me with gifts then nuked me. 11/10",123.8
"my all time favorite game by far!!! i can honestly say iv played it wayyyyyy to much but its so much fun!! the only downside is on harder dififulties the ai gets to much help. it makes it hard to catch up but its possible.",440.9
"honestly best 4x game ever i love playing this with my buddies multiplayer 6+ people or just finding out cool ways to use the civs",211.0
"this is such an awsome straghty game! u should buy it!",201.7
"i recommend not only the game, but the dlc as well. having so many civs to choose from, it will take hours upon hours to play as them all. for me, this makes civ v interesting and new every time i play. best dlc for a game by far.",355.7
"in my opinion this game has limited replayability and no challenge to it as i beat deity within a few hours. i certainly am not the kind of person to keep playing this for hours on end in order to shove a nuke right up gandhis  because he is a massive . overall 0/10 10/10 in reality. i live for this game.",450.8
"as someone who is no fan of the other civ games, i went into this with no expectations for enjoyment. i was so wrong! great game and with gods and brave new world it is fully featured to make even the critics enjoy it. just one warning. do not start a game at night, you will not be going to bed if you do!",93.3
"have been a fan since civ 1. i highly recommend getting this game if you love epic conquest and strategy style games. there are so many variables and so many good civs to play as that the replay value on this is endless. if you have never (really?) heard of this game, do not hesitate to get it. be prepared to be unable to find a spot to stop playing. once i start a game, i can hardly stop until it ends. very hard to save and come back to later, but i definitely make time very soon to do so.",414.1
"theres a few features that would really improve the game massively, but it still retains addictive and satisfying gameplay. as someone who adores history and strategy, this is a brilliant game. i feel as if it is a true celebration of human history and culture!",720.8
"amazing game, endless amounts of fun. with civ you can play for 6 hours solid and not even get board. i would recommend this game to anyone, for the people who dont normally play turn-based games spend about 1/2 an hour playing it and you have learn all the basics needed to have a really good time. should buy if you have the cash!",580.6
"one of the best strategy games available vanilla version good but map packs improve it massively.",190.8
"realy epic tbs game.it lets you redifine history as you know and puts you in the role of histories most important leaders. nearly endless singleplayer replayability with every playthrough beeing different and the multiplayer ,although buggy, is realy awesome. all in all epic game 11/10 its oke skyrim with less rpg and more strategy.",158.7
"this game is just magical, i really enjoy rewriting history:d",298.7
"not much to say about it. a very deep game with different styles of play. i reccomend this to anyone who is into these kinds of games, if ou liked age of empires, youl like this too",88.1
"i like role playing as the glorious female leader of carthage.",172.7
"ive really enjoyed playing civ, as always. i think it still could have been much better. id recommend purchasing the game when its on offer! ive played a lot of it and after a few very long games now, ive began to become bored of it. but its still recommended, especially if you have friends to play with!",196.4
"bought this game, i dont have a life now -10/10 (sarcasm 10/10)",56.3
"this game is a very fun stratagy game that never plays out the same twice. with so many different leaders and paths to take, it is truly an unpredictable and exciting game. the two expansion packs in the game add even more, with more civs, wonders, the introduction of religion and new trade systems the game ends up being even more exciting than before. every step you take could mean an entirly defferent result in the game. rated at six out of five, this game is by far my favorite game out of any other i have played.",406.3
"this is a very fun game that can be played for countless hours. i have last-turn disease from it! i never want to stop playing and the time flies byr. its a good game with a lot of mod support and dlc that is very fun. i would recommend to anyone!",94.7
"i love this game! to the point where i have to limit myself to the weekend or else ill be up all night playing it! its a great turn based strategy, in the more difficult levels you really do need to think far ahead and plot your way to victory! although its quite different to civ 4 it still has the core gameplay and feel of civilization, and over the patches and dlc have ironed out problems that most initially werent happy with. it comes highly recommended from me, but be warned, its also highly addictive.",381.9
"our words are backed with nuclear weapons - mahatma gandhi the terrible of india nothing more to say. 10/10",535.9
"ive only played for a few hours. its pretty meh. probably wont replay too often.",168.6

"one more turn. just one more, then ill go to bed.",68.1
"combine risk and catan and what do you get? a sid meier game. this one in particular is absolutely spectacular! with great soundtrack, gameplay, and fun, i would truly consider this an absolutely perfect game. 10/10",33.5

"i nuked an enemy 22 times and my friend called me a nuclear psychopath...yeah its pretty fun (other playstyles are available).",379.5
"if you are considering getting this game - then you already love civilization/alpha centarui. this isnt civ4, but it doesnt try to be. with all dlcs/expansions to date, it stands very strong on its own, and is jsut as fun, if not more so (imho) than civ4. if we could get an alpha centarui remake on this engine i could die happy. once again, if you love these types of games - get it (with all expansions/dlc - a steam sale will throw them 50-75% off) you will not be disappointed!",520.2
"honestly one of the best games ive ever played. definitely need to give it some time to understand it and it not always a fast game so not an ideal game for people who want a fast exciting game unless you play on the multiplayer.",76.8
"great game, just finished a three hour match where i found myself as president ghandi of india, i started world wars one, two and even three, then nuked everyone... dont  with ghandi! 10/10",43.9
"one of the best games on the market at the moment. can run on low end machines and looks fantastic on high end ones. if you dont have it, i suggest you pick up the gold edition to add to your collection.",40.9
"this is a great game, you can just play this for hours and you wont even realise it. ive got the full addition and i have to say it is money well spent, ive played nearly 90 hours on this and i still havent explored every feature! i definetly recommend!!!!!!!",133.3
"this is civilisation! intitally i couldnt get into the hex grid which was a departure from the earlier games. however after a while i barely noticed it. the expansions have only added to this. if you havent played this by now and it is your type of game then you need to own this. (and what is wrong with you?) get it at any price.",355.1
"if you dont care about maintaining a relationship with your friends, or having a social life, this is a must play.",91.8

"morocco was tired of my blue jeans and pop music in the year 1951. 11/10",54.8
"overall, civilization 5 is an excellent game. its graphics and overall gameplay would make anyone that likes strategy games love this game. you can play it with friends on multiplayer and servers are easy to set up. the only thing i dont like are the dlcs, which are exspensive. nevertheless i highly recommend this game its one of my favorites.",43.5
"i have played civilization since it was first released, the latest version has got to be the ultimate in strategy gaming. it is easy to get lost in this game, where you control most every aspect of creating your own unique civilization from the ground up! definately a casual game, yet with complexities that can and will rob you of endless hours!",149.6
"love this game and the xpacs. im pushing 1000 played hours and still find ways to have fun with this game!",1033.2
"awesome, one of the best games in the world. if you playsingle player the cpus will automatically at random declare war on you. it keeps you on edge wanting more.",37.2
"i think this game has infinite replay value. there are so many days where i have just played atarting in the morning and i check the clock and it is dark out. it sucks you in, its challenging, and it is lots of fun!",50.0
"the best way to get rid of few days, a week or even a winter. be careful though.",36.3
"like minecraft, except completely different. reminds me of civilization v.",88.7
"if youre getting this, make sure to pick up brave new world. the gods and kings expansion has basically been worked into it (with a ton more content). the extra civs you can live without, but make sure to pick up some form of expanded game. the base game is a bit flat.",222.0
"this game is truely, the king of just one more turn. great game and amazing new options with the expansions.",238.1
"best strategy game out there. no question about it. dlc makes it better, but vanilla is still great.",1029.4

"the only game where you can nuke your friends :)!.",24.8
"extremely fun, challenges even the best strategizers, addictive! get it!",372.8
"a true classic for all strategy lovers. ive never seen a game so complex and amazing looking. the movements are smooth but later in game the game start to slowly get an fps drop due to the vast amount of units. i guess that is natural, as most games would fail to get that right as well. the ai is smart, difficulty is at the right level to what you choose... maybe a little too good.",275.0
"civilization 5 is highly addicting and is a very good choice if you want to make a lot of time disappear before you even realize it was gone. if youve tried the previous civilization titles and didnt find them fun give civlization 5 a try, it plays more like a strategy board game then previous titles.",543.7
"like the rest of the civ series civ 5 is likely responsible for reports of skipped or missing time.",99.5
"sid meiers civilization v is amazing. this game lets you create your own story, and you create your own history of your own world. when i play this game im not just watching the screen, but im there in the game itself. civilization has economy, culture, technology, a believable world, and a military that has an advance developed game of chess feel to it. the possibilities are endless, and so is the gameplay. brandon m.",289.4

"do not buy this game. if you do... there is no going back. just one turn and your life is gone. you keep thinking to yourself: just... one... more... turn...... but it is no use. you cant stop. you have been addicted. 1000/10 best and most addictive game in the history of man.",238.0
"as a guy who sucks at strategy games, i was surprised to see me wasting 60+ hours (and counting) on this! try it. even if youre not into the strategy category. just... one... more... turn!",85.5
"hands down best game i have ever purchased on steam! all the rumors about this game being addictive are 100 % true. purchased it on an evening, ended up realizing it was early morning before i looked at the clock again. 11/10",37.5
"warning, may be hazardous to your productivity, relationships, sleep, sex life, basic nutrition, self-care, etc.",399.0

"very fun game which will never get old with all community mods e.g world war ii",4.9
"civilization v is one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing. whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out. sure, i miss some of the deeper inter-civilization relations that the more defined religion and government setup brought in civilization iv, but thats nothing anyone new to the series will even think twice about. with all the tips, advisers and tools in place, this is the first civilization for pc that i feel is worth just about every persons time. go forth and create, subdue, and exploit. do as firaxis has done, and bring civilization to the masses.",125.1
"buy this game. just do it. it may ruin your life and cause you to lose all sense of the passage of time, but its worth it! also, watch out for gandhi!",518.5
"brilliant game, tactically makes for a true iteration of the civilization series. a wonderful game all round.",143.9
"very addictive, highly suggest people play this game. i also find it passes time, a lot of time, infact days! no really, it is addictive!:) 10/10",57.9
"not as good as civ 4 when it comes to the logic but is a very fun game to play. defo worth getting the expansions too!",639.9
"for beginners, it is so complicated. many buildings, civilizations, leaders, units, policies and production to learn.",11.3
"probably the most fun ive had in a game for 10 years. easy enough on the lower difficulties to get a hang for the game, and hard enough once raised to difficulty 6+ to continue challenging your strategies.",322.8
"ill just play a quick game of civ 10 hours pass 10/10 would play again",178.5
"just one more turn. oh, you thought you were gonna play for 15 minutes? nope, youre playing for 15 hours.",517.6
"while civ v has been the subject of much criticism from the series long-time fans, dont let their silly words of anger distract you. the civ formula remains intact in this latest game, and many of civ ivs clunky elements (i never liked religion and espionage) have been removed. additionally, wars are now much more fun and tactical to fight thanks to the one-unit-per-tile restriction despite some glaring (but still relatively minor) flaws introduced by the concept. the only things i can name as negatives are the rather stripped-down multiplayer (which i dont play anyway) and ridiculous dlc prices. just forget about these, buy it, then set an alarm clock because you *will* lose track of time.",171.7
"11/10, a realistic experience ~ would love to get nuked by ghandi again",103.9
"its like crack cocain the strategy game. i cant stop thinking about it. dont buy it even when its on sale. it gotpotential to replace your future wife, job and life in general. you cant even hide on a mac from it.",57.0
"i can deffinitly recommend this game to all strategy game lovers, if anyone ever played any of the earlier civilization games, you should not expect it to be too much like the older ones. yet even though stuff has been changed or even taken away, that is more than outweighed by new additions, extremely well done graphics, the new soundtracks, and the new combat system.",332.3
"this game is very addicative has a very good time that you play on it! 10/10 would do!",46.2
"endless fun. this game has so much replay value, i guarantee you wont get bored.",456.7
"if declaring war on everyone as gandhi isnt realistic, i dont know what is.",105.6
"sid meiers civilization v is a superb game for the strategic gaming community of steam, involving multiple simmulations of the development of a human civilization through the passage of time with a multitude of victorys and ways to achieve them from influential leaders of humanities past to play as. from leaders such as catherine the russians to napoleon the french you embark on a conquest to subdue humanity through the means of a cultural, economical, technological or domination victory.",16.8
"an amazing game with little faults, sid meiers civilization v is a beautiful crossover of total war and age of empires. play as alexander the great, augustus ceizer or even napolean as you make your way to world peace or world domination! play as an ancient civilization and work you way up through eras which are different ages sorted with different technologies and items. as well as a historical game, civilization v is a strategy turn-based game completely mad on your choices! destroy the french, make peace with the chinese, eliminate the roamans, whatever you want! it also serves as a window to learning more about history, except in a really amusing way! i rate this 9/10 for its amazing gameplay and the re-playability.",47.2
"best game of all time? easy, civilization. started playing it in 2007 and im still loving it today. this game ruined my life!!",5.5
"probably my second favorite game on the pc. makes you feel important.",356.3
"started the game up once and stuck for 5 hours straight, great game!",15.8
"this is plain awsome, build empires, conquer, creat worlds. you can play as all the greatest leaders starting from the dawn of time. washington, alexander the great, or even julius ceasarus,",113.7
"the pinacle of strategy games: civilization 5. a must buy.",29.7
"very fun if you think you would enjoy creating and maintaing a country from the beginnings of time to the future era. there is nothing like being the last country standing in a massive scenario where you make the history... you play as historically correct civilizations from the past and even though it is a turn based type strategy game all players are pretty much taking their turn at the same time... this makes for a real time effect and can make the game seem way more interesting...",331.4
"its streamlined but that doesnt mean its bad. troop management on the field is more important now with the stacking roops being gone and cities being able to defend themselves.",59.4
"one of my favorite series. a great game for those looking for a good challenging and strategic game.",50.9
"civilization v is a very slow paced game that can take days to complete. singleplayer is one of the most boring experiences i have had in a game. grab a few friends to play with and this is a solid 8/10. very few glitches i found and tons of replayability. for those casual gamers out there, this is the way to go. building your empire or knocking others down, this is the best empire building game out there. solo rating: 4/10 multiplayer rating: 8/10",15.1
"the game is good, achievements are somewhat satisfying. the game is decent. overall.... quite repetitive. it is fun for the first 4-6 months, after that... look for another game.",405.4
"have you ever wanted to nuke china for no reason at all? well now you can. -ign 10/10",97.9
"good game. just needs the multiplayer to be fixed thou.",232.5
"it is a very good game played them over the years the only one i never played was the spaceone i think.",58.2
"not much to say other than its a great game. ive spent plenty of hours planning moves, building troops and utterly destroying other colonies and countries. really fun game if you like turn based, strategy games",303.0
"immersive does not begin to describe this strategy game. its easily one of the most addicting games out on the market, thanks to its decpetively quick turn-based gameplay. each turn is quick on their own, which sets up the just one more turn mentality. which is why any gameplay session - lasting from either five minutes to five hours - will feel like it has gone by quickly. if you want to have your sense of time distorted while roleplaying as an emporer, then this game is meant for you.",355.0
"very good game. it is fun to play for hours, though it seems much simpler than previous versions. so it can quickly turn repetitive. the cure for that i have found to be spending few hours playing civ 4 or civ 3.",121.7
"fantastic statagy game. breathes fresh air into the series, but holds true to core mechanics of past games",149.3
"i have been playing this series since civ 1 back in on my amiga 5oo days in the early 90s and if you are into world/civ building strategy titles in any way, shape or form, games just wont come better than this masterpiece, it is immensely fun, totally addictive and returns great value for your money. worth noting is that i have exclusively played vanilla (with the exceptance of purchased official dlc) single player vs ai for civ 5 (i.e. no mp at all) , but judging by previous experiences from earlier titles in the series, i dare guess that mp is even more fun and challenging. add to this the plethora of user created mods via steamworks and you have an almost endless source of digitalized entertainment!! :-) this comes highly recommended as a game with the almost perfect mix of theme, ambience, game mechanics and outright addictive fun.",182.3
"one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",414.7
"this game is well worth a play for any sort of stratergy gamer at any level. weather you prefer war or peace this game is for you! the easy to play style with diferent ways to win means every game is different. with diferent faction units bulidings and effects you can enjoy playing diferent leaders (my faverouts are russia and japan). anyway i hope you buy this game and enjoy this. if you have this game feel free to add me for a multiplayer game.",82.3
"really fun game and the addons add interesting new stuff, so i recommend playing it with the addons.",155.9
"civ 5 should be put up as an honorary strategy game with its own historical plaque or something to signify it. in spite of the recent launch of beyond earth, coming back to civ 5 just to play the vanilla game - without any of the dlc or whatever - is still very good. the mechanics are still veyr familiar, with different bonuses, graphics, and a new map gen; and the main things vanilla seems to lack is solved by adding the brave new world and gods&kings expansions. tl;dr: dun good guys. 8/8.",134.6
"a very excellent game, the gameplay is quite fast especially with a 180 second turn timer and quick combat enabled. it provides many many hours of gameplay and fun. i also recommend watching a quick youtube introductory video before your first game to get the basics or to play with a friend with current knowledge on civilization 5 or previous knowledge on previous civilization game(s). 10/10.",73.7
"if you enjoy the game of risk and world domination you will love this game and i will be more than happy to test your strategic methods in an epic battle to the death",238.5

"i thought i knew how to play this game, but then i realized recently ive never even thrown a nuke at someone in game. i have so much more to learn. ill keep playing until i can win the space race by turn 3.",126.9
"this game is amazing... simply put. it is extremely addictive and you loose all sense of time. you start playing at 5:00 pm and suddenly its midnight and you realize you didnt eat anything.",421.5
"this  is n epic i get to play as my royal ancestor and kick",116.1
"turns out gandhi can make nukes in the 1500s. overall 10/10 great game.",108.1

"great game, played the original and now i even play beyond earth. civilization v is still my favorite.",167.3
"a crazy addictive game that will have you playing day after day to refine your play style and skill. truly a great game and a big improvement on the last game in my opinion. this is the sort of game that you could leave for a few months and come back to and still enjoy. tones of replayability and enough options to make each game completely unique. 9/10",384.7

"normally i dont review the big titles but civilization deserves it. this game, and all predecessors are the best turn based strategy games every made.",54.5

"great turn based game. always end up spending more time playing than i wanted to.",186.1
"awesome..with brave new world 10/10 without eh...8-9/10",91.2
"civ 5 is the ultimate time sink. i started with civ 4 and transitioned to 5 to play with friends. while multiplayer chances have fallen through, single player still brings me a lot more entertainment. you want to see your civilization grow and suceed, even if that means crushing everyone else. you never know what may happen in a few rounds and what youll discover.",49.1
"any multiplayer game lets you stab your friends in the back, but only civ lets you keep pushing the same knife in deeper for weeks at a time!",13.3
"not as fun and flexible as earlier iterations, in part due to style of play. i do love the touch screen support for when im playing on my surface pro 2 though.",27.5
"this game is awesome and very addicting. everytime i need to do something ill say to myself oh ill stop at 1 oclock and then 1 comes and goes and i keep on playing. only play this game when have lots of time to dedicate to it and do not have other important things to do. addtionally, the community for making mods for this game is great. there is wide variety of mods to use to spice up gameplay and to give you new game modes to play.",127.9
"time flowing like a river, till its gone forever. gone forever. 10/10 should play",149.8
"a good game to play when youve got nothing to do for a few days",205.6
"i like being that city that everyone loves. makes me feel like i...belong.",33.8
"this game, even without its dlc, is absolutely phenomenal. how many other games let you progress from men with pointy sticks all the way to the nuclear age, while juggling your empires growth and spread, citizen happiness, resources, culture, diplomatic relationships with other civilizations and technological advances? and thats before you get into its dlc which adds tourism, religion, espionage and trade routes. the only flaw is how long it takes to play a game.",134.2
"i told myself id get off after one more turn. ive been playing for 10 hours straight. 10/10",44.2
"very fun and addicting, but the complete edition really shouldnt be $50, i recommend getting it when its on sale.",63.0
"a quite interesting update to a great series. the new map sytem allows for much more variation in land types around a city, as well as allowing much more control over how the resources within your field of influence are worked. the strategic resources look like an interesting change as well, though ive not quite gotten to use those as much as i would like.",60.0
"i think 70 hrs in the space of a week and a half talks for itself",134.9

"one of my favourite strategy games, sometimes its all in your favor, other times you are getting  on. 10/10",190.0
"i like it. i just dont see paying 30-50$ on it at that price pont its not worth it maybe a 10/15-30$ price point then id be ok with it",0.8
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. its awesome! :d",23.5
"absolutely amazing. literally nothing bad i can say about it.",79.2
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played, its amazingly quite easy to learn, but still has alot to offer past that, i would reccomend this game to anyone who has played strategy, and who has not, because of the games ability to teach you fast and suck you in.",238.6
"really awesome turn-based strategy. better than the original, with awesome strategic and tactical options, and great graphics. it has less replay value than civ 4 though, as after a dozen games you will fully understand all the nuances, and the additional downloads offer little of interest for spicing things up.",473.8
"best time sink ever ! no rly, just one more turn. prices of single addons and dlcs can simply be considered as greedy",76.4
"what i really like is the replayability of this game and the fact that when replaying i can go completely different routes to complete the game",57.4
"made a religion called atheism and the vatican was desperate to have me send a few missionaries. 9/10.",156.5

"civilization v.... sitting on the pinnacle of steam top purchases basking in the adoration of strategy players and your here with a blank look on your face wondering what it is. well take a couple of minutes of your god forsaken miserable life to lift your eyes of your daily degenerate lifestyle to comprehend the apex of gaming. civilization 5 is a strategy based game that revovles around turn based decisions and adaption to environtment and resources around you to achieve various types of victories. if you have patience and are a veteren rts/strategy player you would enjoy this.... well i did anyway.",1006.6
"best turn based strategy game i have ever played. great game and diplomacy mechanicsi indeed worth it. :)",593.9
"i normally dont ever play games like this. in fact this is the first 4x strategy game ive ever played. i am really enjoying it, this game is such a blast to play. this is definitely not a game for everyone but do give it a try. download the demo, if you like i say pick it up. i bought it on the summer sale and am loving it to death.",8.9
"absolutely perfect. the amount of possibilities makes this game amazing.. love it..",103.8
"its a great game. if you like history you will love this game. conquere the world, be a deplomat, nuke gandi, build the pyrimids, and descover philosophy and found a religion. awsome game. totaly worth it.",87.7
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. there are some issues but those are so minor in comparison to all the great things firaxis has done to not only make this accessible to new players but even returning players as well. i can say with great confidence that you will not get a better game of strategy right now then what civilization v has to offer, it is just that good. [9/10]",90.6
"i have to say, go for it. it should be on sale in a few days pick up a couple dlcs while youre at it. i am still torn on what i thought of gods and kings. while i liked the introduction of spying and religions, i felt that the religion portion felt more like an after thought.",415.5
"pretty much perfect for what its meant to do, you can tell this is a polished game, i heard it was bad at launch, but those problems are gone now. everything from the unique units to the soundtrack says that these guys know how to make a turn based strategy. this game is one of those easy-to-learn, hard-to-master games. you can have a great time and compete with only the most basic of civ knowledge, but at the same time, even after playing for 100s of hours you could still discover new concepts that bring more depth, like swapping works of art, or managing specialists. i do recommend all the dlc, it adds so much, expensive i know but this game usually comes up every sale.",684.6
"the best strategy game ever, making days feel like hours. really time consuming but in a way that you do not even notice",262.4
"this isnt a game, its a crude time machine. a minute quickly turns into hours.",150.1
"say goodbye to your life, cause once you start to play this game, you start to be addicted to this game.",25.2
"its a fun game, but it crashes, a lot. the crashes are very random and ive tried many of the commonly recommended fixes and to no avail. sometimes it will run fine for hours, other times it crashes every few minutes.",34.4
"this game is the best game ever made. 8/8 m8 that is my r8",16.5
"i have never played any games in this series but honestly, i think this is my favorite strategy games. you take contol of you own civilization and choose if you want to be a militaristic empire or if you want to become allies with all the city states you find. i recommend this game to everyone. ive been hooked ever since i started playing.",46.8
"hm. if steam had a star rating system, i would give it 3. the gameplay is great for a strategy game, brilliant in fact, but unless you shell out the sixty-some dollars for all the dlc, it just isnt worth much. i got it from the nice fellows at humble hundle, so i got off easy. but poor you, waiting for a 60% sale. and if you want to connect with your friends, be prepared for a ton of space usage (that said, i dont have the best internet provider, per se). of course, with said dlc, its great. immersive, tons of strategy, and will keep you entertained for until you need to keep yourself sustained. truly fun. worth keeping on your wishlist for sure, but unless you and your friends have the dlc, be prepared for a semi-fun six-hour marathon of civ that leaves you awkwardly unsatisfied until you come back.",132.7

"ive never played any of the previous civ games and im a huge fan of catan (a board/online game it reminded me of) so this automatically won me over. civ 5 is more complex than catan in that it has more features to offer and its more organized, less random, and more relaxed whereas you can never predict what your opponents are gonna do in catan so it gets pretty intense. you play a historical leader (each civ comes with perks) and choose how you interact with other leaders and their civilizations. you can build whatever you want, from armies to cities, as the technology and resources become available to you throughout the centuries. its addicting and so much fun; i can only imagine the shenanigans and how awesome itd be to get a group of friends to play. plus im really diggin a lot of the references made with the achievement names. cant believe i didnt get into this sooner.",99.8

"very great game! too bad im too stupid to know how to play xd",31.3
"this game would be much better had i bought the expansions. the lack of city state involvment and the no religion facter in to make it a tiresome experiance after a nice 3 hour+ game. although a masterpiece in the turn based strategy genre, civ5 can become an assortment of tedious commands that dont quite live up to what your want out of them. i love playing shorter games and its worth the 7.50. would never ever buy it for 30. but civ fans most certainly should.",41.7

"this is an excellent investment, if you enjoy single player turn based strategy games. its better than any previous civilization game, and the only thing it is lacking is playable multiplayer. the mulitplayer just takes far too long to play a game. its meant to be a single player game. its a deep and complex strategy game with a fun atmosphere. i will be playing it from time to time until the next civ game comes out. the only alternative to this that i would recommend as far as turn based is civilization revolution for consoles. its not nearly as deep but if you like multiplayer more than single, then you can play a game of civ rev in a reasonable amount of time for mulitplayer. this game is one of my top 5 favorite games.",141.6

"this game is the worlds slowest marathon... and i cant get enough of it. ill admit, when you start to reach endgame (1800s-2000s), 9/10 times i just get bored and end the game through warfare, but the first few thousand years are so much fun, i keep coming back for more... i love the battle for territory and the fragile relationships with the other leaders, i almost always take perks to increase the rate of border expansion for increased chance of conflict. overall, the game costs to much, pick it up on sale and you wont be sorry!",272.9
"not quite as good at civ iv in some aspects, worlds better than civ iv in others. im still a sucker for some empire earth or age of empires, but as for tbs games in general, civ v has a lot of moving parts, is a very involved game that can take days or a few short hours depending on rules, setup, and play style. good replay value. great with friends.",68.7

"this game is like the funnest thing evar !!! but no joke once someone declares war there is basically no way to stop playing until one of you is dead. i dont recommend playing this game if you have somehwere to go, because right when you want to stop gandhi nukes you, and you arent going to let that er live, even if you have something better to do.",78.8

"i set up a game to reinact ww2. it was an 8 player game with the chinese, japanese, germans, russians, polish, americans, british and i played the french. i minded my own business until just before the modern era, the germans unloaded a full scale assault on paris. i wasnt surprised. everything was going according to plan until the americans backstabbed me at orleans. it was completely uncalled for. the historical inaccuracies really bring this game down from a 10/10 to a 5/10. would not recommend ever playing the french. much betrayal, such conspiracy, so war.",167.7

"this is by far one of my favorite pc games of all time. the reason i think this game is so good is that it never really gets boring, there are so many mods for the game, and its so dynamic, its just really hard to get actually bored of this game. to top it off, it has great graphics, which in all honesty arent really required for a game like this. i might be a bit biassed of course since i love all of sid meiers games, but this one really takes the cake, i would recomend buying this game to all of my friends.",183.3

"whether civilization v is better than iv is a debate that has raged on for many years. in my own opinion, this game is the superior of the two, mostly due to the expansions. yes, it sucks to no longer have to worry about the health of your cities, and golden ages happen far too frequently, but at the same time, the combat and movement systems are far improved, and you wont have to worry about having massive stacks of hundreds of units just to have an effective military. if youre new to civ, this game is the best choice for you, but if youve been playing civ for a long time, iv might be more up your alley.",117.3
"i am so unbelievably addicted to this game. i have stayed up until 4 in the morning for the past three days, just trying to beat it on easy. i shudder to think what the tougher difficulties have in store, but i am definitely looking forward to playing with friends. and leaving it open to the steam workshop is awesome, because who knows what crazy  stuff people will come up with.",71.4

"civ5 is an epic and complex analytic game. whatsoever, i can recommend it to everybody who likes turn-based strategy and folks who like to use their brain. when youre playing call-of- and else, dont buy civ5, i really believe your neurological structure mass will be damaged when you try to find out how the game mechanics of this dainty videogame would work. hm, yes, im really certain you would die. exruciating and without blessedness and love. doesnt matter, the game is easier than civ iv and it has its own stupidity (click the right thing, next round, click the right thing, next round - oh a nuclear bomb! - click the right thing, next round) but its in principle good mastered so that it isnt in evidence. enjoy - or buy civ iv, both are good, the older is better but the recent is more modern.",34.2
"really fun, but can be time consuming. i start a game at 2 p.m. , and before i know it, it is 9 p.m.! very addicting, and requires strategy. i built the great wall of brazil. ghandi made the great pyrimids of canada. washington made america where china is today. i lost the space race to the aztecs. 20/10",198.7

"civilization. sid meiers. its as great as it will ever get.",52.1
"out of all my games on steam civ v is by far my favourite, and most played game. as a game it offers some of the most sought out content: choice (the ability to choose your nation and how to build your civ), strategy (the need to make plans and revise them as the game goes on), great ai (sometimes ruthless ai), multiplayer, etc. all in all a great game!",367.3
"if you are new to civ like i was at first this game can seem a little overwhelming due to the vast amount of content offered. however after a few hours of gameplay you can expect to be navigating the overlays and maps like a pro. this game is non-stop fun and super addictive, i often find myself playing for hours and hours even after i say to myself that im going to play only one more turn and save. highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in turn based strategy games. game also has steam workshop which adds to replay value.",135.0
"dont trust gandi.... he will kill you, and wont care.",283.2
"each game takes hours to master. especially if you set for large scale maps (i favor earth personally) and slow times with many players and city-states. i seem to have a problem completely taking over enemy capitals in war. ill deplete the entire health but it wont give me an option to make it into a puppet or anything. be prepared to spend days combating other players missionaries (man i hate islam..) and never trust gandhi. great music, good voiceovers. its a thinking-mans game and i give it a badass stamp of approval!",19.1
"im not the best at this game, but its super fun and addictive. youll get sucked into a vortex. stay away.",36.7
"great game i would recomend this game to enyone who likes controling a city and domonating conterys",23.5
"this game is awesome! i sat there for 6 hours and it felt like 15 minutes. also im friends with the one more turn logic so i keep saying ill play one more turn, but that turns into 30 or 40 or 178... must buy this!!!!",43.4

"to be honest, this is one of my all-time favorite games. many mechanics are different than civ 4, so do your research first. in my opinion, they are all for the better. for example, cities can actually attack units. furthermore, you can no longer stack units. civ v now uses hexes for movement instead of squares. both of the expansions change the game in several ways. gods and kings adds religion and the ever-so-fun espionage. brave new world adds ideologies (which can become powerful enough that you can convert cities to your empire), revamped-diplomacy, revamped trade, and encourages working with other civs (not that you have to). the base game itself is fantastic, and each add-on only makes it better.",553.9
"must have for every civilization fan! great turn-based game which mixes classic civ-approach with some new features like hex instead of square fields and more tactical approach in battles. if you want to try it i have to warn you - have a lot of hours prepared, because it is really time-eating game!",322.7
"dont buy this if you dont want to spend the rest of your life staring at your computer screen watching as you dominate enemies. also, that excitement when you are about to get nukes. the game is seriously good though. since the game is slow paced (unless you are in a war with someone who is near you) it makes it easy to eat and play at the same time. there is a problem though, none of the ai (i play with ai since i dont think any of my friends have this game and you cant save in multiplayer. or atleast, as far as i know you cant) the ai barely accepts anything. want some peace with that guy who hates you and started a war with you? too bad. he doesnt want peace. and even if they do allow peace, you have to trade in order to negotiate peace, and usually they never accept that. overall, this game is pretty solid. once you start to know the mechanics you can enjoy the game.",42.5
"please dont buy this game. it will corrupt you. you seen frodo with that ring - its like that but much worse. my friend has been driven to constant paranoia for fear of nuclear strikes. if you choose to buy this game, run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye, cos nothing will be able to save you.",841.8
"this game is great if you play with your friends. when you go online people are very cheap and get things rather quickly because they find ways to make one city be a power house and for them to win a game quick. which is why i never recommend on playing online but only online with friends to just have fun.",399.1
"this game is amazing. have played over 200 hours and would highly recomend this game to anyone interested in this genre or looking for a new game. it is fun to play with friends and also solo.",225.5
"an absolutely addictive game that will keep you entertained for many hours. build up your civilisation as you expand into new territories, making friends and foes alike. using its simple turn-by-turn basis, your actions will shape the future of your empire. there are many ways to win, and that is the beauty of this game - there is no set path you have to take. if youre the type of person that likes to wage war on others then you can win by military strength. if you prefer more peaceful ways, you can win by achieving a cultural victory. or if youre keen on winning via scientific means, be the first to have the parts needed for space exploration.",182.8
"this is one of the best games that i have ever played. most of the time when people play games they get really bored after playing it for a while, with civilization v you get a lot of replayabillity and endless descisions which make it really fun to play over and over again. one good bonus to this game is that, if you choose to, it provides a lot of historic value in it telling what certain heros, millitary units, and even time frames did, why they were important, and how they shaped the world today. the game provides quotes after each technology is reserched which provides interesting, motivational, and even funny parts in the game. i 100% reccommend this game to anyone. although i am a little disappointed that i paid $15 about a week ago for it and it just went on sale for $7.50. even with that being stated i would buy this game even if it was $30.",356.5

"just got into the civ series with this game. as a new civ player, the single player content alone was worth buying the game. civ veterans seem to disagree on this based on other reviews i read. i let my brother try it and he got hooked. i woke up to him still playing the next morning, so i got it for him for and unlike others, we havent seen any multiplayer issues, yet (hopefully this continues). i think its important to note that i found this game looking for a new rts and it is filling the role quite nicely even though it is turn based and not filled with the fast paced battles i am used to. if anything, the slower pace and individuality of each unit makes it more fun than your everyday rts.",261.4
"its better than civ4, and thats all i need to say.",181.2
"i cannot stop playing this game! i had tried civilization: revolution on the xbox 360 before, and also seeing that i was raised in a household where my father played the older civilization games, i couldnt ignore this game. the experience was definitely enhanced by the graphics and the new hex grid. nearly all aspects of the game are amazing, whether it be the music or the assortment of civilizations. needless to say, this is one of the best games i have seen.",110.4
"lol this is a big little kid game. all you do is click on these little toys and fluffly stuffed animals that look real and you make them do crap and the game does most of the work for you lol. it takes no skill and its worst than farmville. it proves that steam has a bunch of little kidz on it because thousands of kidz play it.",1.6

"like strategy? like challenge? then you will like civ v. in short it is an improved version of the previous games but with some added content which is also a blast. although i have been playing with gods and kings dlc added on so it may be slightly different with the standard version. also having online is a lot of fun especially with friends as you can have a lot of people playing at one time. its also nice to backstab a friend once or twice for not giving you that bit of oil...but thats just my story. also with a large and active workshop community new mods are fun to use as it only expands more on what civ v offers. although if you are not interested in long game times then you might want to avoid this one for now or get it in a steam sale as games can take hours and even days. although there is saving so you can take a rest but dont think you can rush victory in twenty minutes.",154.2

"amazing. thats all i can label it as. nothing is more fun than watching your enemies capital be ingulfed by a mushroom cloud from your nuclear arsenal. with plenty of modding capabilities, the possibilities for this game are endless. this game overs a great variety even without mods too! will you be a kind and benevolent leader, or a merciless tyrant? will you be a religious fanatic, or a rational heretic? will you pull the world into nuclear conflict, or make world peace? will you stomp upon those weaker than you, or will you make allies and fight the neverending war machine? will you build a nation, that will stand the test of time?",137.3

"one of the best strategy games i have never played, and here is why. 1. pick your own civilization from about 12 diffrent civilization. 2. is your play style peacefull, merchant or militarist? pick your own civilization that fits your play style. 3. nice diplomacy and trade system. (sometimes its hard to get the computer to trade with you) 4. there is random personalities option, whitch grants other civs random personalities. (if it wasnt self-evident) 5. workshop, there are tons of diffrent civs in workshop. gives the game alot re-playability. 6. nukes and xcom-squad. 7. it kicks",99.2

"i have always been a fan of civ, and this game has to be the finest one yet. it felt lacking in some places, so the gods and kings expansion is one that i feel is very important. overall, this is an essential game for anyone even casually interested in strategy gaming.",536.9

"this game has stolen many hours of my life. i surrender them happily. combat makes sense, except when you have a modern tank taking on barbarian warriors with axes and you still lose one hp for each one you defeat. everything else is fantastic.",313.4
"extremely addicting. im not good enough to win on normal difficulty, id rather play on easy and feel like a god as a obliterate all the other civs or build everything beyond every civ. the interactions with the others civs has improved. previous civilzation games made me feel like a twerp to be bullied by every other civilization... either by demanding money and gifts or demanding i go to war with my ally.",99.9
"great game. however, dont play without a clock because you will lose track of time.",93.4
"civ 5 is really really good. unfortunately so was civ 4 and the streamlining and simplification of civ 5s systems dont quite make it a worthy successor. if youve never encountered the civilisation games before civ 5 is the best entry point, but people familar with the series may be a bit disappointed with the omissions and simplifications civ 5 brings to the formula. better with the expansions, but still not quite the evolution of civ 4 that you might be looking for.",10.0

"if you used to have any free time, it has now gone. its time to set alarms to remember to eat and sleep because the call of one more turn is going to reduce you to a gibbering mess. give up your career or university degree because civ 5 is here any you dont really need anything else.",35.9

"my only experience with civilization before civ5 was freeciv, and this game is a big improvement! note, though, that it may not actually run on your linux install. i have to boot into windows to actually play it, which of course means i only play it very rarely. this is sad, because its a good game. if you run linux, only buy this if its on a serious sale; that way, if it doesnt work, you arent out the full price.",65.7
"very fun, but not sure about the mechanics, and games take a very long time; which i guess is good :)",22.4

"a fantastic turn-based strategy game.the best representation of the series and certainly the most accessible for new and old players alike.",154.1
"sid meiers civilization v is probably my most beloved game, and deserves all the praise it is getting. when playing the turn-based strategy game i found that i could play for hours on end, letting my civilization grow and my army conquer. i loved playing the single player of civ v, however i found that i enjoyed the multiplayer muc more. online multiplayer with my friends was probably the most enjoyable part of this game for me, we ran around, conquered empires and razed hell... however the multiplayer with strangers is a different story. you will find that these people either kick you, never join, attack to quickly or just leave, and even when you do find a game they are probably playing on a dlc you dont have. overall however, its awesome! rating = 9.5/10 great!",157.8

"this is the most entertaining strategy game ive ever played. even though im somewhat of a latecomer, its never to late to join the party :3. so much replay value, and the dlcs are definately worth the investment, especially gods & kings expansion. so if your a fan of turned based strategy or even just strategy have a look at this!",135.6
"some features surpass civ4 but the combat system is still something i sorely miss. however, with the brave new world dlc, the game became more interesting for me! trade routes and defending them game my game new life. i still wish paradox would get a budget like this for their games.",162.3

"good gameplay the mods support give you even more interesting stuff to do worth 30 dollars dont buy for any thing on top of that",75.1
"an amazing game if you are into strategy. my love for this game is mainly because you get to build a civilization from the times of cave men to the times that have yet to be seen. during this time you do not only build your empire but you see the technology that society has discovered and the world views that the world has lived by. 10/10 - ign",339.2

"built the great pyramids underwater and was then nuked by ghandi",59.6
"civilisation v is a quite complex (and lengthy) strategy game. if you are into strategy games and have several hours to kill, then civ v is my prefered game of choice. despite what you may hear, even the worst of computers can run civ. however the problem with civ v is that for it to be a decent game you need to get dlc. i personally suggest saving up about 30-40 and buying all the dlc in the summer sale, where it is much cheaper.",173.9

"very good game, i would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy genres. the graphics for me are supurb and the little animations when you battle singleplayer! in my first game, my tank anihalated a spearmen and the animation to me very funny. great game!",92.5
"if you like turned based strategy this is the game for you. countless hours fly by without even realizing it. multiplayer is there as well; its fun to get two other friends on the same team and watch your research skyrocket while you gang up on all the other cities. great game, well made, and all round fun to play.",81.8
"accidentally nuked my own capital when trying to move the nuke there. s good.",194.1
"i played this game, i wanted to love it like i love civ iv, like i loved civ iii before that and civ ii before that (and yes, i also played the original civilization) and i dont. it just doesnt feel right. i hate the silly combat system that seems designed to frustrate the player, rather than to add an extra dimension, and i hate it so much that i cant love this game. so with regret and probably one of very few, i dont recommend this. and i put 75 hours into it, which might mean something to you.",75.3
"great game that you can play multiple times and each time is different.",644.0
"this game is definately built for people who went from risk to axis and allies because risk was too basic, then thought this isnt complicated enough either... that being said, i love it, 5 stars.",308.3

"excellent but very addicting game turning minutes into hours of competitive strategies of awesomeness!",9.9
"i really like the new civilization. some people were critical because they simplified parts of the game and didnt add anything revolutionary. i think they did a good job of streamlining it while keeping core gameplay elements the same.",104.4
"this game is a true must-have for any pc gamer. i read an article, i believe on pc gamer, that said that this is one of three must-haves for any pc gamer, and i agree. the addictiviness of empire building in a stregy setting may not be readily apparent to the average gamer, and i must admit, i was skeptical the first time i heard of this game. but then i played it. and i fell in love. the depth of the simulation is offset by the simplicity of the interface of the game, and it can be as in-depth as you want it to be, allowing it to be a deep, hardcore government strategy game fore the more hardcore fans of the genre, or a simplistic delve into some fun empire building for the more casual. 0 outta 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",195.2

"i got three things playing this game. time leap, joint stiffness on my hands and waist and a great fun!",17.1
"civ v is a great turn based strategy game which lets you take history and make it submit to you as the master of all history and other boshtets. in all seriousness, the best part is being able to bomb poor s who still use crossbows and swords and crap. id reccomend this game to turn based strategy fans and people who really like seeing rome become a world power and stuff.",127.1
"an excellent addition to the civ series, streamlines a lot of micromanaging, uses hexes instead of squares, and has a totally overhauled (for civ) and awesome combat system. not quite up to alpha centauri levels of greatness, but superb nevertheless. on balance, better than civ iv (i say this as a former civ iv addict).",230.7

"considering this is a turn based game rather than a shooter it is ridiculously addictive. ive owned each release from civ. 1 onward and have enjoyed them all. if you dont like the relatively slow start then use a small map and begin in the modern or future eras. this is a really good alternative to shooters if youre willing to think and plan, connive and weasel.",228.6
"i dont normally write recommendations but for the sake of the steam promotion, heres one! hard to go wrong recommending any game in the civilization series, this game being the latest. it doesnt improve upon (or replace) civilization iv in every way, but it is prettier than civ iv, and introduces some interesting new mechanics. i dont play it frequently, and thats because a single game of civ can take tens of hours, and is consistently difficult to tear yourself away from once begun. if you look at civ screenshots or gameplay videos and you think, that doesnt look fun or that looks too hard - youre wrong on both counts. you need to play it to understand why its so compelling, and its not as difficult as it looks. if youve never played civ, id highly recommend it, and this isnt a bad place to start.",70.6

"great game, time consuming though as you never find it in you to quit, youll always wish that you got 1 more turn before you go to bed or work. the expansions are worth it too, they really add alot to possibilities. i wont reccomend this game if your someone that isnt patient.",30.4

"playing with a good group of friends who wont troll will vastly improve ones experiance. playing with people you do not know is a crap shoot. single player feels like a waste of time.",420.0
"civ v is a really fantastic game to play with your friends. the single player, though, is good at first to learn the ropes but you will become bored of it after the first few games. this is probably because the amount of fun you have with your friends in the game is in sharp contrast with the amount fun the single player is. if you have friends that have or want this game then get it. if not then i would recomend waiting for a discount or price drop.",118.9

"is addicting and fuun... i would tickle sids  for a copy of this game. 11/10",24.8
"i love this game. ive stayed up for countless hours just playing away trying to win. its easy to learn but hard to master especially if the game is not set in your favor. i would recomend this to good strategists and people who just like having fun with there own civilization games.",67.1

"okay this game is still by far my number 1 recommendation. everytime i play it i have a new experience. i mean really a game that has unlimted possibltys. i mean spelling aside, this game is wwhat i would recommend for anyone who is intrested in this style. pros- amazing -fun to solo -fun to duel -amazing scenarios -ai isnt a push over on normal(prince) and diety is super challenge mode it can be said this game has covered all the bases cons- if someone dcs in the game it blows",195.5
"if you do buy this game i only have 1 thing to say never under any conditon im meaan anything (seriously guys) do not let ghandi mass destroyer of worlds take your uranium (seriosuly he will take it build nukes then nuke you with your own uranium i mean common)",62.2
"ive just recently bought the game, and have played it for 4+ hours non stop. just as soon as you think you are at a good break point, you just keep on going. i had my doubts about this game, but even with the arcadish, non rts, battle mechanics, the game makes up for it in content, and flexability to bring your empire where ever you choose. coming from a real time strategy enthusiast, this game, definitely delivers. a must have, especially if you have friends to team up with online ;).",22.7
"fun, if you like a game in which is very time consumeing and alot of stragity involved. also when playing mutyplayer you can have great team work , or just try and kill as much as you can",246.4

"nice idea, bad realization. if you click trading, youll see that computer can play well with huge debt and negative happiness. that makes all single gameplay useless. when im building second city im have (-) in gold and happiness, need to w8 a lot to build simple building, while he already has max number of units... and this happens even at simple difficulty level(",109.6
"its different from the previous civ games. not worse, just different. the old ones 1-4, were only really strategically challending, but civ 5 is much more tactically challenging. its still about the overall strategy of where to build cities, when, how and how much you want to expand... but in civ 5, you have to think a lot more about the placement of your troops. i like this change, and if you want to play each eras units in proper wars (and have the time to do so), a marathon length game is quite fun... but its going to take some 50-100 hours to get to the endgame!",244.6
"a massive ing timesink, definitely fun when playing with friends, im not too big on this kind of game tho so i cant say how it compares to others in the category.",30.7

"i have been in love with civ since i played the timeless civ ii. whilst civ v will never capture the simplicity of civ ii it is certainly worth the investment especially if on sale. the add ons do add a lot so it is worth checking those out too.",8.3
"good game, was russia, expanded my empire, end up fighting their riflemen with giant death robots, had 30 uranium, launched at least 20+ nuclear missles, turned world into radiation hell. needless to say i controlled every city on the map and dropped nukes on myself and still won. 10/10",448.2

"remember what happens in a civ game stays in a civ game",376.9
"this game is one of the best games ive ever played great improvement from civ 4",22.5
"amazing game and i absolutely love it. the only reason i say no is because they wont let you upgrade to the complete edition and instead make you rebuy the game and i dont have that kind of cash to splash, which really sucks cause the dlc looks amazing.",73.8
"fun strategy game. would reccomend to any fan of the series or to any turn based strategy in general.",332.8
"this is a really fun game. i had only seen one civ game before (civilization revolution) and had only played it for a few hours and wasnt a huge fan of it. but this game is truly extroardinary. i didnt play turn-based strategy games before but know i do. definite buy. 12/10",9.6

"civilization v is one of my favorite games i have on my computer. its like creating your own history. da is good :)",486.2
"250h+ and still so much to learn, play and do! start with just civ5 and move to the expansions as you get bored with the mechanic and switch it up!",235.8
"why dont you own this yet? the game is its best when you have both the brave new world and gods and kings expansions.",173.5
"die hard civilization fan here so the only thing i can complain about is the inflated price of the dlc packs, i really want the new brave new world dlc but 30 bucks for 1 dlc is kinda ridiculous especially with civ6 scheduled to be released next year. i already bought the game and all dlc available seperately, so i have already spent more on this game than the price of the combo. on top of that i didnt get some scenario games with some of the earlier dlc and a few of the civs, i tried steam and civ support and they each blamed the other and ended up giving up after fruitless hours of customer service. awesome game but the support sucks from steam.",506.9
"this game is great i could play it all day long if it wasnt for the fact that i need to eat and sleep.",71.9
"if you are going to buy this game, you need the brave new world dlc. once you have that it will be great expirience. i recommend this game extensivly 9/10",636.2

"even after playing this game since it was released im still finding out new things about it, and the mods sure can make it alot funnier. have yet to try the multiplayer, as im still pretty happy with the singleplayer ai. if you like turn based strategy games you, wont be disappointed buying this one.",159.8
"i would greatly reccomend this game for anyone who likes strategy games. this has already given me hours of fun, with many more to come, im certain. the multiplayer featre is epic, allowing you to save and resume a game at any time later, which is very useful for me. the ai is very good, it is reasonable as far as i can see. i have not played the other civilization games, so i am not comparing this game to others like it, but i would definitely reccomend this game for you to purchase. it is well worth your money.",166.2

"any essence of a life i had this game has taken,,,",40.0
"a simple learning curve allows series newbies to be able to pick up the game and enjoy it, while a host of new features will keep civ veterans engrossed for hours. also, the dlcs are something to pick up, they introduce game transforming elements that make it feel like this is civ 6.",479.7

"i modded this game and destroyed the vanilla version. 0/10 no multiplayer mod support.",130.3
"games kindda stale. the new game mechanics are certainly welcome for anyone familiar with the civilization series. with that said, its the same ol cheating ai. your comp opponent with still be in the stone age, but attack with tanks and watch how the next turn all its citites are amazingly teched to modern armies, as well. dimplomacy and trading is still a joke and useless.",44.6
"a real challenge for the strategy players among us ;)",138.9
"this game is the epitome of global conquest and strategy games. although it is turn based, it keeps you interested and intent on taking over the globe. the ai has improved tremendously, and can be extremely challenging. it features multiple difficulties, for beginners and experts, and every type of intermediate out there. this game even has a multiplayer, so buy and we can battle or work together to rule the world!",134.3

"great game if you are looking for a game you can invest time in, would reccomend that you get the gold edition for the gods and kings dlc.",60.2
"its definately worth it, i love it. its for the type of people who love strategy and long-term games.",78.2
"amazing game, but dont expect to play a quick game. i have spent over 50 hours on this game (at the time of writing this review), but have only just finished my first civ. simply wonderful strategy game.",54.7
"a real turn-based strategy, balanced your civilation with military, diplomatic, religion, technology and social policy. own the world, win the game.",50.2
"11/10. one of the best games ive ever played, sid meier again makes a fabulous game. smooth gameplay and infinite replay value make it top notch! with more than a dozen awesome civs, and dlc that is very much worth the purchase, its a game i asbolutely love. cant wait for civilization: beyond earth!",281.1
"people want money and power. in the game, you can have both.",107.2
"awful game dont even bother, a complete total let down the turn based style is dull and very confusing. the grapics are ok at best the story is so ing dull. i wanted nothing and still felt let down.",3.3

"its so much better now than it was at launch. great game to just drop some time into.",390.1
"you know what? i love civ games, but this one finally pissed me off. the hords of dlc is matched only by the shocking price if you didnt buy it all in one go. what a shameless repulsive way to make money with these  little micro-transactions - individual civilizations can be purchased like collection of ing pokemon as long as you are stupid enough to pay the money, and you even have to pay... for map packs. thats right, something you could make as free dlc from the steam workshop now has to be paid for. they have literally chosen a bunch of great features of civ 4, taken them out of the game, and made you pay for them.  you 2k...",66.0
"yes the stacks of doom in civ 4 were ridiculous and needed to be cut down, but firaxis decided from one extreme to the other. on the scale of civ 5, the no-stacking rule makes combat kldugy and artificial. there many other over-reactions, such going to free roads to 1 gold/turn maintenance, and having most city buildings cost money to maintain as well. i read an artidle in which a developer said that they going to try to do almost everything differently in civ 5. they certainly succeeded. but point was supposed to be not to just change it, but make it better. there, they failed.",59.2

"dont ever buy this game or you will lose all your social life... you have been warned...",180.8

"first time trying out the civilisation series. must say this game really got me hooked.",19.8
"better than civilization 4 but not as good as actually ruling the world.",67.4

"except for the fact that a short game takes forever this game is boss.",32.5

"culture, science, religion... gold.. these are the stuff of civilization. an excellent marriage of strategy, turn-based combat, and resource managment. lose sight of your civilizations goal... and neighbouring leaders may leave you in the dust. leaders come and go... cities crumble... so too will the tangible relationships of your family and friends as you whisper to yourself just one more turn",66.9

"oh god, how long have i been playing this game for?",295.5
"man, this game was one of the first games i got on steam, and i love it to bits. the best part about it is the historical inaccuracies of it, like discovering the nuke with the maya and bringing about the actual end of the world. when you get bored of playing the game conventionally, mods can completely change the feel of the game. for me however, i was playing the vanilla version of civ 5 for 100 hours+ (i have no life), so when i got gods and kings/brave new world, it was like a whole new game to explore! i am still enjoying the game to this day, and i most definately will buy the next sid meiers game on the line-up. 69/10 - swaggy as  !! :p",520.8
"i have spent too much time playing this game. it is too addictive, save yourself dont buy it. the only thing i have agaisnt this game is that the ai seems wholy incompetent and the multiplayer interface isnt easily customizable.",629.2
"this game is amazing, just buy it if you havent already. even if you dont like turnbased strategy games, you wont regret picking this up!",121.1
"there is nothing quite as satisfying as growing your empire in a world of bright faced, young new nations, hoping to find a nice place to call home. then murdering them one by one, taking each of their cities for yourself and burning their best and largest just to prove a point to an ai that just wants to cover the world in trading post.",280.8
"i built the great lighthouse next to a small enclosed lake 11/10 would play again",164.5
"this game is fantastic. if you dont know how to play it can be a bit overwhelming but once you learn time will fly...like for reals. youll tell yourself youll go to bed after just one more turn....and then all of a sudden the sun will be up and you wonder what happened to the night time. it is utter crack, i cannot reccomend it enough.",95.3
"great game. very accurate, lots of strategy, and long matches. turn based game that takes days to complete a match. great dlc and interesting combat. different units and diffeent time periods. on the bad side. opposing leaders dont have much common sense.",106.4
"one of the best strategy games ever, i never get bored playing this game i always come back and play more of it! i highly recommend this game :)",445.7
"id write a review, but, im busy playing civ v. so sorry about that.",101.1
"this game is really fun if youre into strategy games. there is a lot to learn and i have a lot to go through before i can call myself savvy in civilization v. all in all, as a beginner, it is pretty user friendly and the help menu has all the info you need, and more.",16.9
"i really like this game. i got into civ when revolution came out on the ps3. ever since i spent alot of time playing the other civ games and by fart this one is the best. when it comes to details, civ 4 might be slightly better, but overall this one takes the cake.",103.4

"i picked up the complete edition during steam summer sale. fully recommend this game to anyone who even remotely enjoys strategy games and has a decent amount of spare time. this was my first real experience with any civilization game and after completing tutorials and one full game so far, i am totally hooked. it will consume your life but youll be perfectly ok with it.",44.6

"meet interesting people of ancient civilizations... and nuke them.",58.0
"this is one of the greatest games ive played, and one of the first big-time games i really went into. sure there have been bugs, and sure there have been moments ive really gotten annoyed at the way its worked, but overall i give it my highest approval.",223.9
"fun? yes. perfect? almost. maybe. depends on what you want out of a game. i think the game is really good and very enjoyable. some factions might be a bit redundant, sometimes barbarians wreck your early game when sometimes they dont bother to show up, certain aspects are even plain stupid like the spying system but all in all the gameplay is solid. my only critique would be that the game options are a bit to limited. i always wanted to play between certain eras for example. say you can only play from the stone age (or whatever that early age is called) untill the medieval era. sure a technological victory or diplomatic victory would be booted out of the door but if thats my decision why not let me? i think it would open up a world of possibilities, new tactics, and lots more fun. 8/10, prepare to sink a lot of hours in this one.",159.2

"the endless possibilities, scenarios, and beautifal gameplay make civ 5 an easy game to lose hundreds of hours in. smart and stylish civ 5 will can make burning the midnight oil easy. it really does embody all the greatest things about the franchise and the expansion packs fill in all the wholes left in the original game. highly recommend this title.",270.0
"this game will eat your time. if you like turn based games or want an amazing time killer, grab civ 5! it feels amazing to build up a nation of nothing and win in more than just the traditional military way. play this with a friend its even better! ill be on this one for a while.",51.8
"right now, i would say that the game runs (with all the dlcs and expansions) like it should be in beta. the gameplay itself is fun and enjoyable, but they havent bothered to fix the stability of multiplayer, or allowing multiplayer games with mods on. these are relatively simple problems that a team of programmers should be able to fix relatively quickly, because of these issues and the lack of solutions i would rate this as sub-par when compared to other games both in the same series and the same turn based style of gameplay.",333.8
"if u are a 4x fan i would definitely recommend this game. and likewise if your not really a 4x fan it is still a great game to play. not just hours but weeks of fun. 10/10 from me.",164.3
"this is a great game and a must have for pc players. it is easy to get the hang of. get the complete edition the normal civ v is ok. the complete edition is what makes it a really good game. 9/10 only due to the fact you need to get the main dlcs.",52.5
"great game, still needs community support in the form of multi player mods.",238.1
"complex game.. certainly for thinking gamers, overall, i find it quite good, but at the same time, its not really my type of game, i prefer more sandbox kind of games. quite good though.",1.2
"this the 2nd strategy game i had played in years and i became addicted to it naturally. really easy to learn, hard to master. although i may not understand the intricate mechanics and strategies that can be applied to the game, i still have a blast with it. japan all day every day.",4.2

"great multiplayer game, has a few bugs though but the game itself is pretty good 8/10",25.1
"simply amazing. for people new to civilization, this is a very intellectual and complex strategy game that never seems to get old. one playthrough is fairly short but i come back to it about once per month and play another. you can also customize the games so much that every time the game is a little bit different and i would challenge anyone to beat it on its hardest setting. for fans of the civ series, i believe they keep getting better. graphics improvements are great but i like the unit and tech changes, i would highly recommend it. also, the leader screens are a lot more involved and interesting. sadly they removed the city view but have the city change dynamically on the map. they also removed the throne room. not sure how i feel about those but at least they put spying and religion back in, in the expansions. definitely worth the money.",155.2

"slow, strategic, gameplay about building a new civilization (not customizable) in a world. history is remade each time you start a new game. unfortunately, ai is bad, and a feature i found on civilization iv which i expected to have in this game is not here. wish when a player disconnects, we could vote again to either wait for the play, save and continue, or save and quit.",354.9

"good game, a little bit boring compared to total war games. its pretty much turn based and i found the xbox 360 version much more fun. wait for the specials to come out and buy it then. if i compared this to total war, i would chose total war. graphics are not that amazing but its believable. my score would be 7/10. total war score 9/10. sim city 9/10.",11.0

"recently, my computer had been having overheating problems, which kept me from playing games other than minecraft for more than a few minutes. this was the one i missed the most. civ v is easy to learn, but difficult to master. a good introduction to strategy games for someone as inexperienced as i was. despite my initial confusion and minor information overload, i found it rather simple to understand, and soon, i was playing it for fun against computers far more than with the friends that wanted to play with me in the first place. i played it so much that i got bored and played around with the things in the workshop. its really quite fun. in the end, it really is more fun with friends, so i would definitely recommend you learn from an experienced friend, if thats possible.",310.7

"addictive. watch your afternoon turn into the evening while trying to survive the world stage! the dlc is a must as it completely revolutionizes the game. sad about the mac version not having mod support unless you get tricky with the files, but even then it causes instability. still glad to have it on both devices.",118.4
"civilization is known as one of the top turn-based strategy games on the market, and rightly so.",281.9
"great strategy game if you like turn based games that allows you the choice between different victory types. more fun when played against human players as opposed to the ai in my opinion as the predictability is much lower but there are a large number of options and player mods to help change the game up if it starts to feel a bit stale. a really good pick up if you can catch it in a sale for around 5 - 10.",154.1

"play this game, you philistine. i dont even know how to describe this game. no other game is so well designed. the systems are simple in their ability to be comprehended, everything is boiled down to pretty little icons but the level of complexity behind them is staggering. no other game permits you to so gradually remove your training wheels. and dear god will you need training wheels when you start out.",311.4

"i purchased this game during a summer steam sale with my roommate, and had no idea what to expect. 12 hours later and we were still playing late into the morning, even with work and class just a couple hours away. while it might not have been the smartest decision of our life, this game was worth every penny and every minute of sleep lost; over 600 hours later and i still havent had close to enough. whether youre a newcomer to the series or a civilization veteran, i cant recommend this game anymore highly to anyone who thinks they have the capacity to enjoy a solid rts. the expansions of gods & kinds and especially brave new world add many needed mechanics and empires that turn an incredible game into an amazing masterpiece, great for singleplayer and multiplayer fans alike.",871.8
"having played every civilization game since the original, at least the pc ones, i can say i really enjoy civ v. especially with the expansions i really dont see myself being able to ever go back to another civ game. for fans of civ games it opens up the flood gates to make any victory style a viable choice. for new comers you have a lot to take in but then again it is a strategy game and if strategy games are your thing a) you are use to learning curves and b) you cant get much better than civ.",322.6

"was not that thrilled with it at first as i found it a bit lacking compared to civ 4 but with the brave new world expansion its a completely different thing. possibly one of the best expansions released for a game in recent years.",78.6
"good game, wish new one was remotely close to this",382.9
"this game has taken a lot of my time; probably not even close to as much as other people who play this. it is a very accessable game but also can be complexed. i recommend getting the expansions as the final expansion adds more importance to faith and culture. this game can be addictive though. i played 3 playthroughs; by the end of the 3rd night, i had 20+ hours into it.",44.8
"do you like good games? do you like the thought of being the ruler of one supperior country that will enslave all others? do you like war? if you answered yes to all of these including the last two then youre insane!:d but seriously... this game is so cool!",237.6

"i have played civilization since it was first released, the latest version has got to be the ultimate in strategy gaming. it is easy to get lost in this game, where you control most every aspect of creating your own unique civilization from the ground up! definately a casual game, yet with complexities that can and will rob you of endless hours!",149.6

"this game along with all of the dlc (the complete edition) is an astounding game, the game looks beautiful and is very enjoyable to sit playing for a few hours at a time. the game is at its best with a few friends with you in a few sittings. if you like turn-based strategy games and are willing to play through a few games not understanding what the difference is between left and right, then this game really is worth the money put into it. i plan to release gameplay of civilization v on my youtube channel, but have not yet done so d:",91.4
"a really simple and easy to pick up strategy game that even people new to strategy games can pick up and enjoy. its a really good game that goes into a high amount of detail on the map and in terms of facial animations of each leader (of which there are lots of). i would really recommend picking up the gods & kings and/or the brave new world dlc as these add new features to the game and fix a lot of bugs. well worth a go if youre even slightly interested in strategy games, it is definitely a good time sink.",164.0

"hello! i have done a few stupid reviews however i am going to do a real review so lets begin. so civilization v has many dlc packs however people will rush straight into brave new world but dont its a great dlc pack however you will miss alot that civilization v offers to begin with, i see many people only getting this to download modded players like winston curchill: with the united kingdom of great britian and northern irelan, or lenin with whatever the ussr stands for (sorry my patriotism is showing xd). but lets be honest you are missing out on alot of content which in evry enjoyable! so civilization v by itself is 8/10 but with brave new world is 10/10 for me!",74.6
"you like good turn-based games? you prefer staying at the computer all day? well, civilization v is your choise now +good gameplay +pretty cheap now +add-ons are really cool! new civilizations and game mods are included. expansion packs offer a variety of new features +multiplayer (players vs players or players vs bots etc.) -expansion packs are much more expensive than the game -civilization v without add-ons becomes boring very quickly so if you have some spare time and 2-3 friends playing this game -buy it!",110.0

"i first played civilization when i was very young. i didnt understand it, at all. it was far too complex for me at that age. as the years went on, i always heard about civ, and how fun it was. when i looked up gameplay trailers though, i thought, theres no way id enjoy that. i was wrong. eventually, i bought the game on a whim, because a friend suggested it to me. i figured, why not? it was on sale. this game redefined strategic gaming in my eyes. the thrilling political aspecs, military, and multiple victory methods. its nothing like i thought it would be. although it is slow, considering the game style, its still thrilling. ive spent hours sitting and strategizing my next move agains the enemy. games can take days to complete. it truely is amazing.",15.4
"as a civ ii fan ,i got to say this is a massively beautiful game that brings out the true charm of the civ series and is yet simple enought to be play by a 13 year old ,if not even younger",61.9

"this might sound like apocrypha, but when combined with the expansions and dlc, civ v has become my favourite game in the series. the gameplay mechanics and additional civilizations added by the expansions and dlc make it a rich and rewarding experience. i have a particular soft spot for the aesthetic style of the game, which feels like a beautiful board game. ive spent many hours playing this installment and dont regret a second of it.",309.9

"the endless possibilities, scenarios, and beautifal gameplay make civ 5 an easy game to lose hundreds of hours in. smart and stylish civ 5 will can make burning the midnight oil easy. it really does embody all the greatest things about the franchise and the expansion packs fill in all the wholes left in the original game. highly recommend this title.",270.0

"simply amazing. a good games takes some time though.",611.1
"to be honest, i would recommend buying this game if you dont have exams coming up. i am speaking from experience here as my friend and i spent almost an entire weekend playing co-op. the addictiveness is incredible, as i just want to play just one more turn, and of course at the end of that turn, war begins or you complete a world wonder or you complete your nuclear missile that ou were planning to fire against amsterdam. in other words i thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it almost 100%. 92/100",74.7

"i have been a huge sid meiers fan ever since civ 2 and i love the civilization series, you can really get bored of ir and you can make your own nations and armies and attack others, control currency, build education, resources and much more. very well made game. the only thing that grinds my gears when it comes it sid meiers is that the dlc cost so much money. the gods and kings dlc is $29.99 which is the cost of the whole civilization v game itself.",10.3
"all-time classic. each installation in the series has been a welcome change and re-balance to the consistently addictive gameplay.",190.3

"what was already good just got better! highly recommended!",107.3
"this is really an upgrade from the old versions. the complexity and multitudes in achieving victory combined with the different civilizational aspects provides an extreme diversity in each game. the multiplayer experience is really the pinnacle of what started as civnet. this game is truly enjoyable in the company of friends in multiplayer mode.",80.9

"veterans of the civilizations franchise may be immediately put off by the lack of features in this hexagonal iteration, but the expansions (gk+bnw) add a lot of content back and steam frequently has them for sale. to be honest the smaller scale of warfare due to 1-army-per-square and reduced warfare abilities in general as a result put me off at first. however, i really came to appreciate how much more significant country borders became as a result of this, making each expansion risky due to quick flanking maneuvers by the ai. i still think the ai for civ is still too predictable and even when set on random, a bit harsh depending on your difficulty level. still recommend the game for fans and newcomers, you will easily end up spending way more time than you thought carving your perfect civ.",132.1
"i think i may have just found a game to replace tf2...",21.8
"civ is a gerne defining game, an absolute must play. the good: - one of the best turn based games youll ever play - every civ has his own strengths and weaknessess - you can customize the map, victory conditions and opponents to your liking - dlcs actually add good content to the game the bad: - some civs are stronger than others awesome game and a must own 9/10",17.3

"one of the best things about civ5 is its replayability. advanced setup, randomly generated maps, and dozens of civs that all act uniquely, this game never gets old. even in the middle of a game, theres always the next thing to do, whether its to reseach a new technology, make your cities happy, or nuke your opponents into a firey oblivion. ive spent entire days playing this game. i regret nothing.",161.8

"it was going great until gandhi started nuking me.",111.0
"civ 5 is a great game and undoubtly the best in the series! however even with the latest patch it still suffers from minor bugs. satisfying an achievement doesnt always register and ai script can be further improved. overall though, there are enough options and features to ensure appeal to all types of players. the gameplay is so much more streamlined and faster than previous versions. not yet perfect but highly recommended!",731.8
"an utter piece of  unless you have every piece of dlc, especially gods and kings as well as brave new world. with these dlc, the game goes from being an abomination to an actually fun sequel to the brilliant civ iv. it has its issues even with all the dlc and patches, but there is definitely still a lot of fun and enjoyment to be had with it.",310.4

"really liked the game, however it is worth taking not that the recommended settings arent always the best ones. i chose recommended and i got through to the renaissance era and it crashed when i recieved the spy and i lost my progress. i found a way to fix it by selecting another graphics option but it was a bit too late and it ruined the fun. since then however, ive been having a lot of fun on there.",79.6
"great game for any strategy fan, several difficulties make it easy to pick up, but can make it frustrating if you jump straight in at too high a level. no real complaints besides rather long loading times, but thats hardly a gme breaking issue.",195.4

"if steam had a boycott list for publishers, i would be the first to subscribe. i regret spending money on this crap. im sure the game is good if you can load past the intro video. i dont know. i never got that far. i tried everything to get this game working but come on, if i had try that hard, then this publisher obviously did not create such a fantastic product or a finished one. it should work with minimal technical knowledge. this is my first review and its a negative one. thanks a lot, 2k games.",25.2
"if you need a high quality time sink, this is a good game. the game isnt boring and is fairly easy to get the hang of. some turns require more thinking and some turns require less. when i first started playing, my ocd to be far more prevelent than in most game. some turns require more thinking and others require no thinking. this is something that is rough on simplier methods of managing ocd. i did manage in the long run. the linux port is top notch. full screen behaves way better than most games. graphics are nice but dont really matter much for this type of game.",157.8

"why is the dlc around the same price as the game itself kill me please",442.7
"great game to start into the franchise even if youve never played previous installments. i would also recommend getting the expension as it fixes a lot of minor inconvenience from the main game. pros - interesting unique ability from each civ - smart different type of ai (conqueror passifism etc) - each game is different from the last playthrought - more to come con - once you become too aggressive, there is no redeeming yourself - no defense against certain things (ie : atomic weapon) - ai is smart, but single minded, they should change with time",619.8
"170+ hours on record and at least an extra 100 off record from before, so yea; this game is a lot of fun if youre into strategy games, but be prepared to spend countless nights awake at your pc taking just one more turn",184.1

"fun in single player, fun with friends. i enjoy the extra game play from the dlcs, was impressed with the culture revamp with brave new world worth getting the complete pack. only problem ive seen with the game is slow loading sometimes in multiplayer matches with several human players, mostly due to the game trying to process every players actions at the same time with shared turns instead of consecutive... i would recommend to any strategy/world domination game fans.",233.7

"to anyone who hasnt played the civilization series, i definitely recommend it. building whole civilizations and destroying others, while choosing your path (militaristic, cultural, etc), building wonders, are a few of things that make this game addictive. the mechanic of having fairly short-term goals under a main longer-term goal makes you forget time and this is the game that inspired the termone more turn. :d",151.3

"fun strategy game. while there are some minor bugs and glitches, as well as some minor annoyances, there is still that just one more turn play that has been with the civilization series. the game looks great, and allows many playstyles. just be aware of sometimes scumbag ai, happiness issues, and most of all, be prepared for the long haul. one game ive been playing accounts for roughly 15 hours of my playtime, and im only about 75% done with it. this is on standard time and map size, and normal difficulty. but anyways, great game, highly recommended.",962.4

"this game really makes you lose track of time. fun and very addicting!",35.5
"i really like the new civilization. some people were critical because they simplified parts of the game and didnt add anything revolutionary. i think they did a good job of streamlining it while keeping core gameplay elements the same.",104.4

"oh this game...i poured so many hours into it. its nothing like attacking the enemy, sucessing and then repopulating their entire territory with your own population. watching their cities turn into your own. i love this game! negative sides are...the siege units are pretty useless in the early stages and the early units are...pretty useless, especially the special units which are shown up early in the game, because you can barely make enough of them that it matters any, because the progress in technology are faster then your cities.",658.2
"ruined my life? well, thats pretty big talk from someone who isnt the empress of greece.",318.8
"great game, ive already put a 100+ hours on this game. its replay value is very high after playing one match your interested to see how another civs plays. by that time you want to try a game as every civ in the game! with some of the add-ons like brave new world and gods and kings this game becomes very enjoyable and interesting.",134.3
"i have always loved civ and have played them all since original and i love this iteration. my favourite change is making each hex only able to be occupied by one military unit. no more single stacks of doom, your units will need flank and rear protection to be successful.",461.8
"awesome game, totally different feel than four(which i consider the pinnacle of the classic civ style of play). introduces city states love them or hate them. the dlc is way too expensive though. i bought the game pre-release which was a huge mistake and resulted in me paying twice as much for the games content where as people who waited for the complete edition(about two years), get a way better deal still to this day. its cheaper for me to buy the complete edition now which duplicates half the content i already own than to buy the content piece meal which is total bs. good game though.",162.1
"if you have any respect for your free time, do not buy this. it has a small tendency to suck you in (in a good way). you play for hours in what seemed like minutes. also, got denouced for being a warmonger by atilla the hun. 10/10",62.9

"this game is probably the best strategy game i have ever played. its extremely fun with friends, and its not too difficult to understand while still being somewhat complex. i think it deserves its metascore rating of 90. however, it crashes on me frequently. so frequently that i may have to reload 20-30 times in order to play a single game. after researching this problem, its apparently common in the steam version.",54.8
"this game is a really enjoyable game for those people that have the time, it does take a while and has a deceent learning curve but it is extremely enjoyable and also a bit of a learning experience at the same time.",91.6
"a brilliantly addictive strategy game and an excellent introduction to the civilization series! great fun over multiplayer (if you have the bandwidth)!",275.8
"this game is probably the best turn-based strategy game out there. it is best with all dlcs and expansions. there are many different options when it comes to leaders and strategies to achieve whatever victory you want. the multiplayer is also very good.",174.7
"the greate and best strategy ever! there are a lot of kinds of development of ur state in this game. you can become a rich person and make boom to other countries. on the other hand u can fight for every piece of land and struggle seemingly insignificant from the poor state. so this game is rly enjoyable and diversful!!!!!! 9.5/10",31.8

"probably my all-time favourite strategy game, if not a tie with the starcraft series. what gives this the edge is that it is all turn-based as opposed to real time, like a board game. with multiple ways of winning and games that could potentially last months (though i havent bothered trying that), the options are endless. highly recommend this game for strategy buffs.",135.1

"its awesome - has a lot of various civilizations to choose from, well-thought game mechanics. the most important truth about civilization 5, though, is that its immensely addictive. once you start playing, theres no going back -",100.9
"i have always been a fan of civilization and this is the best one so far. it sucks they only added religion through dlc but atleast its there. this is definitly a fun strategy game with some serious replay. multiplayer has always been my focus when dealing with civ. the multiplayer is fantastic and i have spent countless hours struggling against my friends and others online. the base game itself was weaker than i wanted it to be but with the addition of the major dlcs such as brave new world there has been much added to the game that makes it feel whole.",127.4
"fantastic game, very well balanced and alot of fun in general. difficult for begineers to civlization though, there are plenty of guides and to my experience just playing on your own your way ends up to be the most fun and addictive gameplay instead of you just using a tactic that everyone else uses and trully ruining the purpose of learning the game your way, just like any individual shoulf play it, but thats only one mans opinion.its a great game, i have 510hrs played of it, and i taught myself everything about the game even though it was my first civ game i had ever played without using the internet xd.",820.4

"civ 5 theirs not much to say that has already been said i mean other games have done what this game does but better. civ i find is much to long and i find myself never finishing games because you have to play one game fo like 20 flippin hours. also the theme in civ is ssooooooo boooring i mean its just ;like real life no space of fantasy relams not even intesne future technology, gayyy. civ is a strategy which automatically makes it a piece of , oh and did i say their was no campign, yea no campagin or a good one atleast. overlall i give civ a.... 10 out of 10 cause is sucks balls, winky face",62.4
"another great addition to the civ series, and now that they have finally made politics a little more viable, it finally has a good depth of play aswell. this game is one of the must have for strategy fans. i have found myself playing marathon games over several days... worst part is that i find it time well spent.",357.0

"civ v may be pretty, but its a very shallow game. it was obviously rushed and released in a very flawed state. unfortunately, the expansions werent able to fix so many broken things. im a fan of the franchise since civ i, and i must say that i have returned to civ iv, a game that i still enjoy immensely. i would recommend this one over civ 5 to almost anyone!",180.4

"great game for anybody, definitly worth your money",411.3
"when i first played this game i thought i only played for an hour. turned out i actually played for five hours straight. this is one of the best strategy games after all. youll be engrossed in building up cities, conducting diplomacy and trade, and warring with other nations. youll find several ways to win, from being the first to reach alpha centauri, becoming the most culturally interesting country, or establishing military dominance; and each historical leader has unique traits to construct your ideal empire and achieve victory. its understandable if you lose track of time.",356.2

"you start with little and keep playing one more turn to unlock that new tech that no other player has, or one more turn to strategize a a siege against the other civs. then you realize its been a hour. ok well just a little more. one hour turns to three then five. great game.",68.7

"one of the greatest strategy games ever. diffinitely a good choice for hours of endless fun.",432.2
"to somebody wanting to pick up this game: wait for a sale, and get the complete edition. itll be worth it. once youve played with brave new world and gods & kings, its impossible to go back. also, do not go for an epic or a marathon game on your first try. id go with quick, just so you figure out how it all works. its kind of an oxymoron, though. a quick game of civilization? impossible.",165.9

"as a monarch ruling under the divine right of kings, i must infallably declare, regardless of my spelling, that this game is very enjoyable. this is a fantastic game for anyone who is into stratagy games. however, i must say that diplomacy in this game is impossible. dont even try. trust no one. beware ghandi. dont blink. blink and youre dead. dont turn your back, dont look away, and dont blink. good luck.",318.5

"25h on record, almost finished my first game! thats some value there.",27.9
"this version of civilization is pale in comparison to its predecessor when it comes to depth an complexity, and i dislike it for that fact. however civilization 5 is one of my most played games. civ 5 is part of the new accessible breed of sequels, designed to bring a known franchise down to the knuckle-dragging level of complexity so xbox kids and fratboys dont feel like total dip when trying to master the intricacies of the lowest difficulty. it is simple, it is fun, you really only need to know one or two tricks to win on any map at any difficulty, and then thats it, you get to master civ 5 and brag to all your friends about it. its fun, simple, different, and more akin to a board game than previous civ iterations.",345.4
"one of the best civ games out there, i wont debate with you why i think its one of the best, but i will concede that its has to be at least in the top 3 sid meier games. i dont think i have to explain why i love civilization games, i mean civ 1 came out in 1991 and sid meier has been making games since 1982 (thanks wikipedia for having a sid meier page) overall civilization games have been one of my favorite strategy games out there and i hope that the upcoming civilization: beyond earth (can anyone say alpha centauri?) is also a smashing success!",11.2

"hands down the best strategy game you will play. given the complexity of the game, the learning curve is steep, but not that steep. ive invested 200+ hours into the game and am still learning new things. many improves in v make this game not only more approachable, but tactically different than its predecessors. various victory conditions and civilizations to play make this game such an amazing feat by firaxis games. a must buy!",314.6
"a great way to spend a lot of time on a strategy game. first time playing a civ game and it was very easy for me to get into and understand after a few playthroughs. the achievements for this game definitely give me something to play for, as well. highly recommend!",119.7
"i have decided to write this review, because i myself wasnt sure about buying, but reading reviews changed my mind. all i have to say that i was doubtful at first, but you learn this game pretty fast, but you master it pretty slowly. just one more turn.... and it is 2 am and i have to get up at 7 am, god... i hate and love this game at the same time. 10/10 would not sleep again.",362.2
"this is based on a game where you can expand you can kill and you can recruit",50.2

"i love this game with everything that can happen in it. there are unlimited possibilities to what your civilization can turn into. as you can see with my hour record that i am an enthusiast of civilization v. tip for people with slow computeres: use a mod called quick turns, it allows you to play in 3d mode rather than strategic game board mode because it speeds up all the processes. and with the hundreds of games ive played with it, i have come across no problems.",775.7
"beautifully made game, but if you fall for the menacing next turn button you will never see the light of planet earth again, aside from in a virtual world on your tiny computer :)",69.5

"this game was a bust at the begining. but the 2 expension make it wothwhile. for sure, everything is streamline. it minimize the micromanagement. unfortunatly, at the higher level of play the ai is not better, it just get some bonus over the player. overall a good buy when on special.",675.6

"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",14.1
"simply incredible. id never played a civilization game before civ 5; its easy to learn and great fun to play. recommend to all strategy fans",220.9

"every want to take over half a continent, or name all your cities tick? in this game you can, as you strategise on the plan for your civilization, wether it is building the notre dame or conquering every civilization in sight. it is rather hard to finish a game, one game can last for hours. i rate this 8 curries out of 10 curries",71.6
"great turn based strategy game. very in-depth with lots of worthwhile dlc available that adds significatly to gameplay.",201.2
"you will need all the dlcs to realy enjoy this (not the maps silly, the game mechanic changeing ones) or it will only be 4/10. i am no fan of the new combat system so for me its an overall 8/10. no must havebut a lot of fun, 3 and 4 are still better imo.",299.4
"this game is fantastic. it has a great gameplay, great visuals, however it is a little bit difficult when you start out. its easy to create games and just play, but requires some amount of thinking, which most games dont require now-a-days. i rate this game 9/10",72.9
"with the bnw expansion the game is now very deep and enjoyable. there are many different and well-balanced paths to victory. as someone who started playing civ 2, it has taken me awhile to adjust to civ 5. they may have the same names but they are fundmentally different games. in one the key to win was near constant expansion and the creation of doom stacks. civ 5 is pleasantly different. pros: culture system is finally come into its own ai is no longer horrible at war all systems well balanced and thoughtful stratagy is rewarded cons: the non-cheating ai (prince) is still not nearly as good at the gam e as any human",133.1
"utterly addictive. its always fun to ttake over the world.",271.3

"you start as a lone settler. from there, create an empire and make it grow as time moves forward. fight your way to the position of dominance or win the hearts of the other leaders. regardless of the choice, you will enjoy many hours achieving victory.",704.5
"great game, many hours lost to it. i cannot comment on this vs the previous releases as i have not really played them.",97.7
"with the gods & kings expansion (and now brave new world), this is still the best grand strategy game overall. you could cherry-pick features from old versions and probably make the ultimate strategy game, but as it is, this is great work.",97.4
"after 4 years of game play; it still gives the first days enthusiasm.",361.0
"very entertaining when played with friends, not less in singleplayer. developing strategical thinking and situational awareness , also providing countless hours of fun at once. its an unique feeling to lead your nation through centuries of always-different-worlds histories. though the base game is a little bit poor compared to the game with all dlcs.",461.5
"a fantastic strategy game which is extremely addicting. where you lead a civilization from prehistoric times into the future! you can play on your own or with friends. if you get bored of the game you can purchase some dlcs to make your experience even better. a must buy for anyone who loves strategy games.",20.2
"what can i say, it is civilization one of its kind, legendary since 1991. i am really glad it has finally got linux support. it needs the latest video drivers, but you should update them regulary anyway.",21.4
"buy the expansion packs. civ 5 vanilla is okay, but the expansion packs (gods & kings, brave new world) make this game as amazing as it should have been at launch.",111.5
"this game is so addicting! too bad i failed a french test for it though.",89.1
"out of all of the games ive played on steam, ive always found myself coming back to this one. its very unique, and you wont find anything like it. its very accurate, yet also intriguing on how precise you can be while playing as that certain civilization. the game revolves around strategy, and unique abilities that only certain civs have. you have to play to your strengths as your civilization and use it to triumph over all. a very unique and challenging game to play with friends and to test you mettle!",196.8
"love these more in-depth style strategy games it keeps you on your toes managing all the aspects of your kingdom and keeping an eye on your fellow civs",29.8
"very good game :) , tutorial is boring, unintuitive and wordy though.",166.0
"one of the most engaging and fun strategy games ive ever played. although, not quite as mechanically interesting or deep or as the previous game in the series (civilization iv, my personal favorite), it still manages to steal hours of your time. highly recommended.",46.4
"alexander the great? more like alexander the grape",39.2
"amazing game. a game that you can just delve into for hour and hours, trying new strategies for different win conditions, each civilization offers unique advantages to and the depth and breadth of gameplay offered is just phenomenal.",328.0
"while this game has been given high scores from professional game reviewers it has also been given bad marks by some longtime civilization players. i dont think these naysayers are necessarily in the majority though. personally the game is pretty good. it is not as good as civilization ivs beyond the sword expansion but i do like it a lot. 1upt (one unit per tile) is a refreshing change that will only get better with further expansions. build choices matter more than ever now because you have to balance happiness, culture, expansion, defense, & conquest all through gold or buildings. it is no longer as simple as adjusting a slider.",883.2
"do you know that feeling when you lead your civilization and become the greatest in the world? its awesome.",282.7
"i bought the gold edition (the one that inclues all the dlc packs) when it was on sale for $12 (usually worth around $50). the last civ i played was civ 4 and it was decent but needed alot of work. i saw my friend playing civ 5 a while back and it looked pretty awsome and jumped on it when i found this one on sale and i do not regret my purchase. i havent had much time put into this game but so far i love it, each game you play is different and nothing is the exact same. this is one of those games where it seems like youve been playing for an hour but then look at the clock and realize that 3 hours have passed. great game, would definetly recommend even if you cant afford the gold edition. if you love stretegy games then this is a great one to try out.",63.6
"one of the deepest yet most accessible strategy games, civ v is superb - i do recommend you get the gameplay-enhancing expansions to get the true experience, though.",191.4
"i have played civilization since the original version and love it to this day. this version has some drastic changes that are unique in the series but is still very much civilization. highly recommended.",876.6
"worse civ to today. id rather play alpha centauri.",15.1
"greece, they randomly produce a persian army in two damn seconds, then they surround the hell out of you by building cities all around you. then, to make it worse, they spam warriors from the ancient era to piss you off.  this game.",78.4
"i have mixed feelings baout his game. i like civ4 better but i like the hexacon map and clouds on civ5. also the multiplayer on civ4 is wayyyy better. if youre new to civ5 and/or want to play send a request.",334.0
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played. i have loved all of the sid meiers games and this one is the best to me. the dlc would make this game entirely out of this world. the only game of this type i think could top this is distant worlds only because... micro managing rawr",97.1
"9/10. play with a friend and u haev time of your life. not a 10 because it takes time to adjust, u dont just start playing and become a master",2.2
"totally sucks , hate it so much , takes 8h to finish a game i can finish 3 skyrim quests instead",27.0
"awesome game. definitely a must have for strategy lovers",202.3
"10 hours at a stretch / 10 would stay up late again",348.4
"i played civ v for 4+ years before i got the expansion packs. i love the game as a whole, but unfortunately the expansion packs have taken away a lot of the fun that i had while playing civ v. there is quite a lot more going on than there was in the original game, so much so that the it is almost too much to handle. im sure ill get used to it in time, but, as of now, i would recommend either only buying the game and not the packs, or buy it all, but play without the packs until you get the hang of the game.",340.1
"if you enjoy destroying your enemies with xcom squads and giant death robots, forcefully convincing other nations to listen to your pop music and wear your blue jeans, or just want say screw you guys, im going to alpha centauri and hop in a rocket ship, this is the game for you.",230.2
"extremely good, gave me the opportunity to recreate history, i loved!",16.7
"this game is perfect for the someone who hates the outdoors, free time and other people. buy this game and those three things will be distant memories. just remember to eat and sleep. luckily thanks to the games turn based nature and continuing memory leaks you can most likely do both between turns. this game is the equivalent of digital heroin. go watch the movie train spotting and if that kind of lifestyle appeals to you buy this game.",427.3
"its a really good game and all, except that the multiplayer mode is broken. everytime i try to play it with a few of my friends it crashes and has to reaload everything every 25th round or so. also, its really slow in multiplayer.",285.5
"take over the world. mess up anyone who dares cross your borders. 10 out of 10.",20.6
"the best waste of time ever devised 10/10. probably one of the few must have games on steam it runs on practicaly any machine and has some of the most addictive stratagy that never gets old. even if you are not usualy a stratagy fan this game is for everyone becuase of its simple nature and easy to get to grips with systems. this game is best enjoyed with a low paced netflix series for maximum enjoyment and time wasting.",411.3
"best stragedy game out there and so many things to do!",350.6
"i vouch for this game if you got ocd like me. ill beat it, then say im gonna do it a different way next time around... then i done played it half a dozen times and still wanna try new ways.",292.6
"this game has a complex set of algorithms which the ai bases its judgement on, and it is incredibly well made. i would not recommend this game as a starter for strategy game for beginners, but it will teach the theory behind most strategy games.",123.5
"finished installing at 1am, ended up watching the opening scene. next thing i know its 4 hours later and everyone on the map hates me. 10/10",30.6
"playing civilization v is basically selling your soul to the devil himself.",68.1
"i have been playing civilization since civii. i can say that his new installment is not necessarily the best; i most favor civiii, and i loved most of the updates in civiv. hopefully, like civiv to civiii, the civilization game after v will be a more refined version. brave new world is a must for this game, as it provides much more options as far as strategy and challenge. overall, would definitiely recommend this game, another legend in the sid meier series.",55.9
"this game pretty much sucks all your free time away. be aware it is more addictive than crack cocaine and you may need to visit rehab if it interferes with your social life.",59.5
"this is an amazing strategy game thats fun and will always be challenging your skills",139.2
"come enjoy the worlds first fifth nation management simulator!",65.9
"fabulous, deep, engrossing. the move to a single unit per tile is a double edged sword - on the one hand, it makes you consider how to best use your army (rather than the stack of doom seen in earlier iterations of the series), but on the other, the ai does not use it effectively (pre-brave new world - this may have improved it but i havent played with this expansion), and it can be easy to crush the ai militarily. that aside, the game is otherwise outstanding.",132.1
"first i was a littel skeptical about the game. but then i tried it, and i been hook for 11 hours in one day.",123.5
"its nice but you must play it in long durations of time in order to enjoy the game. playing in in a short period of time is like eating one potato chip",52.5
"an exceptional and highly polished game with dlc that is pretty solid. i love it!",130.0
"civ 5 is a great game! cant stop playing and recommend it to anyone.",436.5
"this is rediculous that the game stops responding regularly......how much did i pay for a game that doesnt always work?!",13.5
"this is one of the best turn-based strategy games i have ever had the pleasure of playing. a must-buy for the fans and a great way for newcomers to finally get familiar with the series.",310.4
"great game to play alone or with friends. steam workshop is always adding new things to the mix as well and the dlcs mix up the gameplay",98.0
"a new twist on an old classic, civilization v brings a whole new experiance to the civ series, be it leaders, or gameplay in general civ v is worth a try.",51.3
"it was a great game for the short time i played it. it is much like aoe, but mixed with risk, it is lots of fun. im not so sure its worth $30, but im tempted to get it. im getting the demo immediatly. 5/5",4.7
"this game is dangerous. you sit down to play for 2 hours after dinner, aaaaaand its 1am. loads of options for nations, strategies, best civ yet.",35.5
"this game destroyed many friendships of mine .... but exploding nukes are so pretty *_*",45.0
"this is one of the funest games that i have played in 2013 and am exited for the new game that is about to go onto this amazing game series",391.6
"this game is an awesome strategy game. for those chess players who like to build like in games like minecraft. pros- in depth gameplay. multilple difficulties, various game modes. always expanding and you can always find a mod to build whatever world or civ you want. con- lengthy for anyone who only wants to play for short periods. some civs are imba and others stink.",623.7
"this game answers the hard questions. how are people created? wheat stocks. how to win and keep friends? bribery. how to create happiness? eat whales.",835.0
"ive sunk hours into this game saying just one more turn and then realizing it was 2 or 3a. very fun game and lots of ways to play it!",101.9
"awesome game! not as much micromanagement as civ iv but for me that is a good thing.",171.1
"civ5 is a fun game to play when you have lots of time and its better with friends",98.1
"its civilization v, the just one more turn game that will get you addicted and make you play for hours. get this game, its extremely fun.",26.4
"cant stop playing! this game is just awesome. buy it now if you dont have it, you wont regret it.",143.1
"i liked civ iv more, but v is also nice. and it has a better fighting-system.",55.5
"i once decided to start up civ v, hoping to play a couple turns, then get back to work. i managed to quit at 2:00 in the morning.",103.1
"combat is better than iv but everything else is a little less fun. from what i understand bnw really makes this the game it is supposed to be. it is still a great game though.",670.3
"this is by far one of my favorite strategy games, even though it is turn based and i usually prefer rts over tbs. warning! this game requires a lot of patientce.",109.7
"been playing the civilization series since the third installment. i was worried at first when reading articles about the game long before it released - concerned that this might ruin the franchise. when i picked up this most recent installment i was glad to see i was wrong. the changes made to the series in this game are welcome in my opinion. recently, the gods & kings expansion came out that has rekindled my passion for this series. i expect great things to come out of future expansions and the newly integrated steam workshop.",390.7
"i have owned civilization 4 and civilization 5 has expanded on every thing i liked about civilization 4. this game was worth every penny i spent on it. i highly recomend this game to everyone.",482.1
"a massive time killer, well worth every hour given over. civ 5 is a solid advancement to the series. the expansions are fantastic, though it can take awhile to adjust to new features. overall a solid investment.",287.4
"the reasons to play any other game besides this one are very few indeed.",266.8
"simple, but still challenging. great mods (canada mod!). worth it.",155.1

"hatch an evil plan to dominate the world, control the land and kill everyone! or just get beat to death by a horde of barbarians as you struggle to research about the wheel. such realism. 8.5/10",97.8
"such a great game. really deep system that makes you really get attached to your civ with so many different ways to play it.",93.7
"this game is a stagedy game and that is perfect for this game. the map scales are perfect, but the only problem is that, if you have bad wifi and play a big map with a lot of players then good luck!",141.5
"my rampaging aztecs and i have found this game to offer countless hours of quality world-conquering entertainment.",987.4
"with 207 hours and counting, its safe to say i enjoy this game. and i do. while i was somewhat sceptical about the base game, just as with civ iv before it, civilization v has blossomed with its second expansion. with the ruturn of religion in the first expansion and trading in the second has made this a true heir to the civilization legacy. if you like this kind of game, you should grab a copy of civ v.",226.4
"lots of fun, can be replayed infinitely with many different settings and lots of interesting strategies",157.5
"clearly one of the best games ever created. to miss this game is to miss a masterpiece.",213.1
"my friends told me not to go japan. i went japan and we lost our friendship. 10/10 would lose more friends again!",47.6
"real classic: it would be shame to miss it if you are even slightly interested into strategy games.",179.4
"this game is the best strategy game i have ever played hands down. although i have not played many strategy games myself this game is still amazing. this game is easy to learn even if you havent ever played a game like this. it is easy to start this game and before you know it 6 hours have passed, yeah its that good. there are many different ways to win including, war, launching a rocket into space, diplomatic, and outlasting other civilations. i cannot explain this game without turning my recview into a book, this game is huge. get it.",182.0

"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",51.1
"great game especially with al the dlcs i recommend for everyone who loves video games that take awhile but are extremely fun for a long time.",50.0
"one of the best strategy, turn-based games ive ever played, but the thing about this game is that it becomes really interesting when you buy 2 dlcs, which are gods and kings and brave new world, without them game looks kinda unfinished. but overall: no dlcs - 7/10 with 2 dlcs - 10/10 would recommend!",172.6
"best game ever. but dont trust ghandi!!! also you should get g&k and bnw",175.4
"pretty fun. optimized greatly on all platforms. works at a great pace on my laptop. gameplay: 8.5/10 multiplayer gameplay: 7/10 overall: 8/10",2.7
"you will never lose more of your life playing a game other than this one, and for good reason, because this is probably the most time-consuming, addictive game there is.",193.0
"finally available for linux, and works even better than on windows! :)",28.8
"civ v is the most comprehensive strategy game i have ever seen and with the steam workshop it makes it more fun than ever.",617.7
"its an excellent 4x game. its almost like a really comprehensive version of risk but on your computer. offers very large replay value has a high skill ceiling while still being accessible for new comers. easy to play hard to master. would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a quality strategy game.",68.2
"must own! we all need to play together and run the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",407.4
"excellent and vastly time consuming. great game by itself, but really starts to come into its stride with the brave new world expansion pack. love it!",104.4
"probably one of my favorite games. makes me feel . in a good way.",240.7
"an extremly time consuming game that is just amazing. the dlc for it is well worth it if you have the extra money and overall this game is just simply amazing.",371.8
"great way to lose an afternoon. its always just one more turn",486.6
"surpassing 250+ hours and counting, civ v is and will continue to be the greatest strategy game of all time. nothing ive ever come across can top the attention to detail, the vast number of playable nations, or the replayability of civilization v and ive played a lot of strategy games. theres a reason this is #1 on my steam list for games played. its outstanding.",315.6
"my review for this game is that i love it. it is a great game i would recomend it if you wan to try it out use the demo for anyone that is not sure if they like it or not",90.9
"i have been using this game to predict upcoming world events, and it has been about 85% accurate in 60 cases. 9/10",104.5
"this is the one game that any of my friends or i can rack up 100s of hours of gametime on and still be dying to play more. this is the epitome of the easy to learn, difficult to master mantra. the many different civs to choose from, multiple win conditions, and map generator mean that this game never quite plays out the same twice. the permutations are endless. definitely buy the expansions, as they add new units and mechanics that are fun, interesting, and well-balanced as well as fine-tune existing units and civs.",813.2
"great game but mainly only worth it if u buy all the dlc and it was deffinatly worth the $25 usd i paid. it is a great time stealer and keeps you entertained for hours",41.1
"ive played this game many times, and i think it is amazing! its an amazing rts game, and it is seriously worth it!",16.7
"i might need to play a game or two, but after 5 minutes of trialing it, im very uninspired. to be fair, i was expecting something else and this was far from it.",2.2

"the most refined and elegant civilization yet. a must have!",23.4
"i cant find the right words to explain how i feel about this game. its just...just perfect.",123.8
"this game is proof of time travel, 8 hours will have gone by before you can click the mouse.",24.2
"this game is amazing! it is for sure my favorite strategy game of all time! the options of what you want to do with your empire is unlimited, you can conquer the world with an iron fist or let the arts flourish among your people. some things i would want to change but nothing you cant fix with a mod or two. i would definitely recommend this game.",121.3
"when i purchased sid meiers civilization v i had no idea what i was getting into. **note** people have said you need the complete edition (dlcs and such) to make the game better, and theyre soooo right. being someone who has played with and without the dlcs i strongly reccomend buying the complete edtion over the standard edition. i played 7 hours in my first real sitting of civ v, and started out as playing alexander, ruler of greece, which was fun and all, but i didnt really enjoy playng as him. after that i convinced some friends of mine to get the game (since it was on sale) and now ill mostly play multiplayer with my friends. they all now love civilization v also and they always thank me for having them buy it. graphics - 8.5/10 gameplay - 9/10 replayability- 9/10 personal rating - 10/10 game! ps never trust ghandi",83.8

"positives: diplomacy is very strong, combat is fluid, very balanced among ai and players, large variety of nations, use of steam workshop, can set up games to your liking and use of historical figures negatives: branching paths of upgrades could have been upgraded a bit more(too small), city-states have very little usefulness aside from getting a new unit every once in a while, and even though certain leaders have a specialized unit, they are actually the same as a normal one. verdict: 8.75/10 recommendation: to those with too much time on their hands. get it. now.",62.7

"is there a better game out there than civ v? i guess only when civ vi is released. great game!",222.5
"its the best turn-based strategy game ive played so far. 20 years of gaming. anything better than this is going to blow my mind. $30 is a fair price. youll find yourself coming to this game for years. for me, this is a game ill play with friends until were all dead (in rl).",37.2

"excellent game. various options and long playing time.",117.1
"this game is amazing well worth the money and it has endless replayability.",149.6
"endless hours of gameplay potential. civ 4 may be the all around better game but v is in my opionion just as good and newer and better looking.",43.0
"all you civilization fans may have heard civ 5 decried due to its seemingly sharp departure from the regular civ formula, witht he one-unit-per-tile rule and the game being focused around that particular rule. take heart! the gods and kings expansion made some sweeping optimizations while adding religion and espionage to the game, and now it feels like a fantastic, top-of-the-line civilization game again. while the one-unit-per-tile rule still stands, the game feels more cohesive now, instead of feeling like its fighting your every strategy. civilization 5: gods and kings saps hours out of you as you become immersed. definitely worth every single penny.",136.3
"15 minutes in and i know i am going to love this game. just what i needed to get my strategy/war fix.",62.3
"interesting game. really liked it. i pleayed it with the mediteranian mod which made me so proud to play alexander the great! i had some problems with it crashing but a quick google fixed it",8.6

"buy this game if you have nothing to live for and you want to ruin your life",63.0
"if you ever played ron you will definitely love this game, some features does not work as good as, but its still an awesome game in the overall panorama, very relaxing to play.",268.0
"awesome game, great polish and presentation, very easy to get started, and can really eat up your time into the wee hours of the night, in a fun way. with the newer patches, the game has become very strong in all modes. playing with friends is a blast. it gets better with time, and the new scenarios help mix up single player and add value to the dlc. all the civ dlc is pretty good, nebuchadnezzar is not quite worth it however. the map packs are a bit weak, as maps are random normally, and you can get map mods for free if you want specific maps. the developers are really showing this game love and support, so give it a chance.",162.8
"have only played in local co-op and have enjoyed that, will probably make further comments as i play in sp. have satellite for internet so that does limit my games that i can play.",43.1

"civ is never a bore, one of my top 3 games for sure!",98.3
"civilization v (5) review this is a really great strategy game. you choose from one of 20 different civilizations to start out with. you build your city, expand your empire, construct buildings, and choose governmental policies. certianly not a fast paced game. it may even take hours to complete. overall a great game for people that like strategy games and have alwasy dreamt of ruling the entire world. a must buy if you have the money!",9.3
"this game is fantastic. once you begin to play you cant stop and you loose track of time.",37.3
"pretty good game. not for anyone who is unable to spend hours planning one move only to lose the game. over all though very fun.",52.1
"one of the best and most accessible strategy games available. i do not recommend this game if you have anything important to do because a single game can be a 15 hour+ time dump.",102.6
"a great game to play with friends or on your own, only downside is that you can lose hours at a time to this game so when you sit down to play best not have anything else planned for the next few hours",424.3

"best game ever! i cant stop! what i really love about this game is that it is completely different every time. no two gameplays are the same and each outcome is completely different. what strategy could work in one gameplay, may not work the next time around. ive played civ 4, and it was awesome, but civ 5 beats it by a long shot!",384.4

"overall, civilization v is an amazingly addictive strategy game. i was skeptical at first, but upon purchasing, i couldnt stop playing it.",53.9
"probably one of the most fun turn based strategy games i have ever played. great with friends! get it now!",666.9
"i really wanted to like this game but in the end i couldnt get into it. the movement tile system is extremely limiting, and to simply move your army a short distance takes quite a while. also the cities are really screwy - you cant build large cities or your citizens will get angry, so you end up having to build numerous small ones. its just way too limiting for me, but who knows, maybe youll like it.",14.9

"once, it was about 11 oclock on a saturday. i had just finshed downloading civ v the night before, so i decided i would play it. i just kept on playing and playing until i got tired. i thought wow, it feels like ive been playing for 4 hours! i should take a break. so i turned off the game and checked the time. it said 5:34 am. i had just played for 18 hours sraight without eating. 9/10",66.8
"i honestly dont have much to say aside from the fact that this is the single most boring thing ive ever spent money on. a very popular game that gets lots of love from everyone, but requires too much patience for me. im having a hard time finding fun in this very slow electronic board game. i paid my hard-earned money expecting a fast-paced strategy game of wars across the world, piliging my way to victory. instead, i have to shove a tazer up my  to be energized enough to stand to play this for more than fifteen minutes. if youre dull, boring, and hate having fun, this is the perfect game to blow you money on. if you like fun and excitement, a cardboard box is much more enjoyable for a much smaller price.",0.6
"ohmahgahd this game is incredibly good and fun and i will always recommend it 90,000% of the time. seriously, play this game.",339.2
"with the brave new world expansion this becomes literally the best point in the series. no stacks of doom, trading, religion, tourism...only thing missing is that espionage could be a bit more fleshed out, with spy units that could poison water and sabotage and whatnot.",123.4

"this series has always been a major upside to my gamer life. i love a challenge, and i love games that take me a long time to 100%. civilization has always fufilled both of those requests for me, and it just keeps getting better. civ v is no exception.",48.2
"good ol civ. soon it will be cheap to buy, so dont hesitate and give it a try!",123.7
"ive been a civ fan since the very first by sid meier. i remember impressing adults that in 4th grade, i knew a lot for my age about geography (capitols and major cities), as well as major political figures. i like civ v, but wish some things like the city view from the day, or building a palace would come back. i also used to plan out my cities with the whole 3x3 thing, but with civ v the geography rules are way different. i also, in all honesty, dont really like the city state thing... i almost always cut the number of city states in half when i play (usually like having larger civs). overall solid statigic game and will play it for hours still, but some features i wish theyd bring back and some shouldnt have been introduced.",91.3

"honestly this is one of the best strategy games out there, i love the style and their attention to details when it comes to the different playable factions. the music is absolutely fenomenal and the graphics are great, maybe not crysis, but its great for what kind of game this is. asbolutely recommended for anyone who loves strategy games which involve more than just warfare. an important thing to note is that if youre looking for an rts like c&c or starcraft 2, then go somewhere else, this is turn based, just like it should be.",71.1
"educational, interesting, fun and all out great game fun to play single-player and multi-player takes up a lot of time however 8/10",61.0
"civ 5 is the high watermark thus far in the series. at this point in time, the game has been patched to be more than balanced and versatile. i hope in future iterations of this game that the music will be evermore expanded to include not only cultural influence, but developmental and incidental playlists.",91.9
"a really awsome game i only with all my friends could play this also!!",39.0
"dont worry, you can always eat/sleep/socialize right after you finish this turn... or after this turn.... okay, after... well, you get the idea. its addicting and time consuming...",67.9
"if youre a huge fan of the older civilization games you may be disappointed by the vast amount of changes they made in this installment of the series. i, however, loved all of the changes. the game feels sleeker, more streamlined and is just a lot more fun. whenever my friends and i start a game up together we find it hard to get off.",75.6
"just one more turn... seriously addictive. its an easy game to learn but has that something games like starcraft have in which you have to sweat every little decision to really master the game.",123.1

"planning on getting anything productive done today? nope 10/10",29.1
"with both expansions this game rivals all other civilizations. a solid 10/10.",69.9
"this game was a highly enjoyable game at all levels. in the beginning, you are still getting used to it and the exploration part is the most fun part in my opinion. when you discover more lands, civilizations, and tehniques. later on after you have mastered everything, the strategy part becomes the most fun part. the game offers unlimited strategies and unique gameplay every time. the one downside to the game is if your pc specs arent quite good enough as when the map gets larger and larger, the game tends to lag. but regardless, this game should be owned by everyone. rating: 8.8/10",146.2
"8.5/10 pros - awesome multiplayer - history lessons? - addicting - good balance cons - buggy multiplayer occasionally - some parts are boring. - large learning curve.",92.0
"this is the best entry level strategy game there is. get brave new world before you play though, it adds a lot of improvements to the base game.",100.9
"the gold standard when it comes to turn based strategy. this series has time and time again proven to be endlessly entertaining offering a great deal of complexity and depth. i would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a game like risk.",275.7

"this game gave me nightmares of being gangbanged by genghis khan attila the hun and shaka of the zulus 10/10",466.8
"this game never gets old. i never truly stop playing this game. i only take breaks in between the addiction. this is one of the best strategy games in my generation with an endless replayability. its simple enough for people new to the genre and complex enough for the people who really know what theyre doing to have a challenge. every time i play i pick a different nation, each one is compelling and i try to adapt the way i play to the civilizations strengths. ...just one more turn.",804.7
"great game. you can get lost in it for a long time.",891.9
"i was dropping nukes on the spanish while they were attcking me with pikeman. 10/10",224.9
"this game is amazing. ive had it and played it for years, and it genuinely never gets old. it has an infinite amount of replayability, and no two games ever end the same way. id fully recommend getting the dlc as well as the standalone game, seeing as youll lust for more content after you play 100 hours or so, and the dlc civ has to offer is fantastic.",357.9
"hey, ive got a couple hours, why dont i play a bit of civ.... oh god its already saterday",220.4
"this is probably the best strategy game ever. if you like strategy games, you should, no, you must buy this. its fun and very, very addicting.",212.4
"hours and hours worth of gaming here. playing now for almost 4 years. its amazing how theyve been able to keep basically the same formula since the first civilization game in the early 90s and it has the same addictive feel now in civ v as it did then. there are many different scenarios to achieve victory in this game. it doesnt have to be about conquest. you can win this game diplomatically, scientifically, culturally or time (highest score at last turn). you dont even have to quit your current campaign when you run out of turns. scoring will stop but you can build your empire for as long as you like. if you are able to get the expansions with this game, i highly recommend doing so. they add so much to the vanilla game that i dont think i could ever go back to it. they just keep making it better.",338.0

"why you no let me sleep! its too good, run while you still can.",324.5
"if you like dynamic strategy games then this is your fix! 9/10",64.1
"the game is a time sink not because its fun, but because the game is slow and takes an hour for what would have been a minute in an rts. the game is polished and clean otherwise. but has no keybind and uses arrow key as screen scroll like a god dayum game from 1980s. use wasd like real people, fraxis. its 2014 and theres no excuse. also conceptually the game fails because its always weird to see washington from 5000bc all the way to 2000ad. they should have scrapped the leader idea altogether and gone with the race as identity instead.",49.3
"if youre going to get this game it would be best to do so with a couple of friends because it has an excellent multiplayer. although you should prepare for some very long gaming sessions! xd",273.8
"great game, played the original and now i even play beyond earth. civilization v is still my favorite.",167.3
"what cant i recommend? this game will eat up your hours, turning day to night. its indepth game play and full on strategy can take you away leaving you wide eyed thinking what the hell happened to you life. note: i am only mentioning this if you really are into strategy and mostly games similar to civ v. the addition of ranged bombardment i think is awesome, it just allows players to fire weapons from behind the front lines, you also have fully animated leaders interacting with players from a screen-filling diplomatic scene which i guess is not too bad, kinda just adds a bit of spice to it. if you have friends, group or a party to play with then this is definitely a bonus.",146.0
"very unique game, crafted to balance out fun and strategy but it in a more light-hearted way. remodel the world from the ground up and see how it turns out for you.",10.4
"great game and very easy to lose track of time while playing. started playing a game at 4 pm and ended up not stopping until 3 am, causing me to fail a test and then having to stay after school. 10/10 would recommend.",127.2

"good game, when i start a game i cant stop, kinda addicting.",292.2
"civilization isnt a game so much as it is a hobby, but if you are into turn-based strategy, civ v is some of the best. ive been playing this series for years and i am still learning things about improving my game. ...just dont buy this one if you like sleeping. civilization and sleeping are not compatible.",460.2
"beware, this game is brutally addictive! only buy and play if you have the time and are prepared to lose it. civilization v is one of those games that is surprisingly easy to learn, but difficult to master. every feature from warfare, economics, spying or politics is fun and lets you lead your country to victory on your own terms. when it comes to turn-based strategy games, they dont come any better than this.",25.7
"the pricing structure for this dlc is so bad, i want to cut my eyes out. buying two expansions is more expensive than the game, and the $120 worth of dlc. i cant even....",31.0
"civilisation v is a quite complex (and lengthy) strategy game. if you are into strategy games and have several hours to kill, then civ v is my prefered game of choice. despite what you may hear, even the worst of computers can run civ. however the problem with civ v is that for it to be a decent game you need to get dlc. i personally suggest saving up about 30-40 and buying all the dlc in the summer sale, where it is much cheaper.",173.9
"a moment comes which comes rarely in history but we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and a soul of a nation long suppressed, finds utterance. build courage when courage sees to fail, gain faith when there seems to be little cost for faith, create hope when hope becomes forlorn and remember....the future belongs to those who believe in their dreams....i have to say, this has been the most fantastic, most amazing game i have ever played. especially when you get the dlcs that can be be bought to go with it. a generally good game with regular civilization 5 but the excitement and intensity of it increases when you get bnw and g&k dlcs. definetly consider getting this game if you havent already and be sure to get the dlcs!!!!!!",367.1
"a great game, but pretty b ullshit for one main reason: dlc; expansion packs which actually make the game worth playing, is priced at 40quid (20 for each). thats 5 quid more than the complete edition. this means that people who bought the original base game are now shafted. this price point is unacceptable and 2k should suck my knackers",138.9
"if you lost this in hb sales, you lost your gaming world. basically i ask to myself why they did not included the bnw expansion, but... no matter, still be the best strategy game i ever played. i had to make a choose, at 3am, my bed or civ, and... i miss my bed.",19.2

"fantastic strategy game (with the expansions-- its still pretty good without them). challenging, satisfying, and replayable.",487.9
"this is a phenomenal turn play statagy game, well worth the money you would pay for it, it runs great not glitchy at all for me and its just hours upon hours of a good time.",545.7
"never play this game before an exam. one more turn will end up being 3 hours later.",302.4
"love the game but i have a problem with is air units like if the other civilzation has guns they shoot it down but im cool with that but if your like 1 era ahead than the one your fight spears can get them?",683.2
"this game is such a huge waste of time, you start playing it and next thing you know, a whole week has passed and youve grown a beard and have poostains all over you. i wouldnt want to waste my time any other way. im currently sat in hospital for not eating or drinking for a whole week while playing this game but it was worth it. its my turn now so i must go, i would write more but gandhi is currently launching nukes at my cities.",50.4
"mixed feelings: pros: -its civil. it has been simplified on some parts, but is good. -nice graphics. cons: -unbearable wait times. i really mean it. on a huge map, on advanced turns it took about 10 minutes to just load a saved game! and about 5 minutes each turn just waiting the machine thinks. -very bad diplomacy. its almost impossible to get a balanced deal. the computer always want to have a very unbalanced deal. -no spies, no sharing tech between cultures. -spain as a dlc?! come on, they were one of the main cultures on every civil. the wait times killed the whole thing. it cant be possible that it took too long each turn to think.",166.0

"superb strategy game. plenty of interseting mods to make the game even more unique.",248.1

"i would say a downgrade from what civilization iv was. the game seems more dull and repetitive. the price also has not gone down much but i guess that doesnt matter. one improvement to the game was the new hexagonal map and being able to culturally expand via gold and improvement of the production. i would say save your money an buy civilaztion iv though.",156.5

"i founded new berlin right on top of where modern day edinburgh sits today. we built such wonders - the brandenberg gate (naturally), the leaning tower of pisa, big ben... we even built the great wall of china right across hadrians wall. people loved that city and came from miles around to marvel at its majesty. great men were born - rommel and alan turing, marching arm and arm across the rooftops of the world. at one point one of my famous playwrites even penned the fabulous wizard of oz. but then, just as we were on the cupse of the atomic age... the manhatten project poised to usher in a burning nuclear dawn over the south of england (and a unit of stone age archers id left forgotten down there), i was confusingly defeated by a random vote at the un which appointed my hapless opponent as world leader. game over.",157.5
"very good strategy with loads of fun ;) however i need to warn that: - next turn button is bugged; 50% of cases it doesnt do anything, 40% it shows some unit which needs new orders and only at remaining 10% it trully ends turn, - workers forget what they were doing almost every single turn, - game starts up and loads save very slow. other than that its really cool and you probably wont regret buying it ;)",35.2
"i started playing this game, lost track of time, i now have a grandson, late for his wedding, bye.",292.5
"one of the best turn strategy games i have played so far. the numerous victory systems will constantly keep you on your feet - rushing towards your victory of choice whilst keeping an eye or even impeding enemies from doing the same. the expansions have brought in fantastic systems for faith/religion and new mechanics for culture. the additional civilisations also bolster your choices and help you refine your playstyle. the sheer number of buildings and monuments you can build also give you a chance to specialise in different areas of the game. wonders are a particularly exciting system, buildings which take many turns to complete but then give excellent bonuses. the historical background found within the game has also amazed me, gameplay and depth top notch. player, will your civilisation pass the test of time? mine sure did, and it shall for many years to come!",153.5

"i love civ 5, i play it often and it has so much re-playability and i think its just an all round outstanding game.",687.5
"ive whiled away many an hour playing every version of this game. civ v has its detractors among those who want a highly detailed wargame along the lines of civ iv, but i like its focus on immersion and versatility. its still not the perfect version of the game it wants to be, but brave new world is a giant leap toward that ideal. the layers of possibilities for your civilization have never been so diverse and interesting. all hail the king of turn-based strategy!",698.3

"wanna have a strategic ? there you go! civilization v probably the best multiplayer-based strategic videogame we have on the market. a bit rough to start, but smooth as ice when it comes to dropping nukes on your enemies or pillaging enemys trade routes. you will find yourself using ultimate strategies in a few days. the game isnt as close to reality as it seems on the first look. for example, how do you research archery into the wheel? still, it is a great world-simulation to play with your friends. you should stay on your friends side, when it comes to 10-player multiplayer game and then backstab them with no harm. as far as ive seen, the dlc-s are also worth getting. the price is a bit high, but when you already have a scouting badge, you probably should get one.",38.4

"one of the best strategy games ive played - an improvement in many aspects over civ iv. as of the last expansion the game feels fully realised, balancing combat, economics, diplomacy, religion and culture superbly. ai, graphics, and ui are all up to scratch, while the mechanics are accessible but with time-consuming depth. equally fun alone or with friends - no other game has the same one more turn addiction - 10/10",364.1
"in the end, i got enough enjoyment out of this game to recommend it, though it still feels off and game-y - it really punishes you for doing things the wrong way, and i never really feel like i can attack anybody until civilizations have guns, when most of the appeal for me is playing as ancient empires like the romans. but anyway, its still worth playing.",38.3
"fun game, though there are some features that are just annoying, or seem relatively useless. perhaps just because i dont understand everything about that feature yet.",115.0
"another addition to one of the most successful strategy game series out there, sid meiers civilization v retains the one more turn addictive gameplay that its title is famous for. and, with great bonus content, quality dlcs, a great expansion pack with another along the way, civilization v certainly holds all of the elements from hours upon hours of strategic and fun gameplay.",376.1
"ive spent hundreds of hours on this game and its still extremely fun. definitely one of the easiest strategy games to get into but there is still plenty to learn and get out of it. two major downsides are that the multiplayer is unreliable and you must have all the expansion packs in order for it to be a high quality game, as vanilla is terrible.",642.1

"no words that have been discovered by the human race can even begin to describe the feelings that you develop while playing this game. not to mention the engaging realism of world politics and your choice of different, scenarios, victories, friends, enemies and allies. this can provide days of entertainment while thinking its funny that countries like germany and poland get along in the completely unique game you have created. this game is absolutely brilliant as a time waster, strategy and muiltiplayer. 9.9/10 can you lead the people of your chosing to victory? can you create a civilization that can stand the test of time?",250.4

"this is an amazing and very well-made game. all of the aspects in the game (such as production) are linked to each other (building the great library for science, building a worker for happiness, etc) in such a way that every choice you make will shape the outcome of the game. it also offers wide range of potential playing styles, so that no matter what mood youre in you still want to play the game. because of this, it has amazing replay value and appeals to a large amount of people. 9/10 (the multiplayer is weird) 0/10 if youre playing with ghandis ai.",252.5
"this game is great and the only real cons that i think are in the game is the fact that the ai are diplomatically(they get really mad at you if you dont want to help by giving them a resource they ask for) and sometimes militarily (they mostly just throw units at you with no thought at not trying to lose one) , its hard to manage a large army of units since you cant stack them, and i always randomly get kicked from multiplayer servers. otherwise its a good sequel to a great game and is actually diffrent from the last civ. game (call of duty im looking at you)",108.2

"awesome game i highly recommand this game if you like turned based strategy game",118.1
"apart from skyrim, this game is one of the top 3 reasons i got into pc gaming. i love everything about it and feel like it could never get old. as much time as i have put into it, i feel like i have only skimmed the surface of what i believe is one of the best games ever made. one more turn will be a though that crosses your mind constantly and on into the hours of the morning. if youre into strategy, get this game immediately. my only complaint is the loading times, but that is my only complaint.",164.1
"before playing this game, my swag percentage was around 63%. after experiencing this icly sexy masterpiece of strategy gaming, my swag percentage reached the new height of 92%.",154.6
"i cant belive that i played it for 1000 hours! every game has needed various situation and tactics.",1028.4
"well, now that its out in a nearly flawless port for gnu/linux, and apparently runs on a wide variety of distros, this is as good a turn-based strategy game as exists (well, except for dominions 4...), and it looks and sounds terrific. with all thedlc, you can play a game that is among the top 5 games available on steam, and have a good old time doing it.",29.1
"i was never much of a strategy guy myself (save some strat rpgs when i was younger) and this game got me hooked on the genre! if youve never played a strategy game before, give civ a try. itll introduce you to turn-based strategy mechanics gradually, but always give you room to make your own goals and do what you want. while the game is pretty damn deep its not as esoteric and complex as most newcomers to strategy games think they all are. you just have to accept that the game is not going to be realistic in the slightest. altogether id recommend this to anyone whos been scared to try out a strategy game, since strategy fans probably know all about it by now.",43.2
"great strategy, worthy continuation of the series.",48.1

"im not gonna lie, games like this i dont really enjoy. but this is something else. it can look quite confusing to begin with however from the guidence of a few friends i was running my own empire, founding new cities and creating a religion. under my control japan was ruling the world. and i was loving it to say the least. the multiplayer works slightly differently but with a few friends its still great fun! overall and amazing game. and i cant really complain when i got the full game plus all the dlc for only 8.99!",44.2
"civ 5 removes many aspects of the game that bogged down the game part of civ. if you need those extreme micromanaging things in your civ game you probably will not enjoy this game. but if you are looking for a game over a hardcore simulation you will find that the changes in civ 5 are very welcome to those looking for a game and not a simulation.",60.1
"a really immersive and detailed game, that explores branches of strategy boldly. well worth my money, and i would urge everyone to try it.",90.9
"great game! very good replayability. steam workshop mods really make for an excellent buy.",234.4

"this game!!!!! im not usually the type to enjoy a game like this, im more into arma and the such, but picking this up in the sale was a genious idea! everything looks so crisp and clean, a little hard to get used to at first, but thanks to the tutorial after a game or two youll pick up everything you need to know. this game is made even better if you have friends to play it with too as thanks to the steam cloud saving you can load up your saved game with your friend anytime, and stop playing whenever you like.",56.1

"the latest in the long and impressive civilization lineage. while the core mechanics remain the same there are quite a few fundamental changes that really alter the flow of gameplay. the lack of unit stacking requires much more careful strategy when it comes to war and the games balance of culture, military might, and science pursuit really does mean any strategy has a viable chance of succeeding. if youre a fan of the civ series at all or even looking for a good starting point, id highly recommend it. beware of the dreaded just one more turn... oh god its 3 am syndrome! if you do buy civ v i would highly recommend picking up the gods and kings expansion. it seriously rebalances the culture tree, adds religion back in, and is generally more of a sorely needed patch than a seperate game but whatcha gonna do?",361.9
"this is one of the best games i have played in recent memory. multiplayer is incredible. got nuked by ghandi 10/10",41.0
"i love this game. the graphics are great and the animation is awesome so you should totally get this game.",185.6
"good game, was russia, expanded my empire, end up fighting their riflemen with giant death robots, had 30 uranium, launched at least 20+ nuclear missles, turned world into radiation hell. needless to say i controlled every city on the map and dropped nukes on myself and still won. 10/10",448.2
"absolutely the best turn-based strategy ever, in my opinion superior to earlier parts... ai in battles could get some tuning, though. i reccomend this game for everyone.",762.0
"this is probably the most fun and addicting game ive played yet. i would not recommend playing this when you need to do homework/study, or else this happens; -paper due tomorrow, should probably start on it -decide to play civ for a while before starting paper -next thing you know, its 3 in the morning -cry",557.1
"over the years (and the expansions/dlcs) this game has become better and better. the one-more-turn-feeling is hard to resist and this game is as deep as it gets. i highly recommend getting the addons, as they really add to the experience. also, civ is often on sale, so that shouldnt be a problem. this game offers hundres of hours of gameplay youll love, if you like turn-based strategy games. by the way, i think that its kind of odd that people who spent more than 500h with civ claim that they cannot recommend this game",370.3
"best buy you could make on steam. will give you hours and hours of fun and entertainment.",678.8

"1 turn until un is finished! yes! egypt has won a time victory! f*******************************************************************************ck",70.1
"love this 10/10. the only bad thing though is that every once in a while, when it is processing a turn for another major civ and the leader wants to talk to me or a new civ meets me or i meet a new civ, the game glitches out and it opens up a small window saying sid meiers civilization v has stopped working. this also happens when i want to engage in diplomacy with a leader.",152.1
"stupidly addictive. ive just begun playing and i already cant put it down. looking forward to getting my hands on brave new world.",228.3
"best game i have ever played. soundtrack is the greatest thing ever. although not enough can be said about the vanilla game, the dlcs and modding community add almost too much replay value!",184.4
"better than the previous civs big maps, small maps, very intuitive pick it up again after a while, and its still as if you played yesterday definitely worth it.",43.2
"excelent game in the series, my favorite since call to power. the game complexity is such charming, and youll hardly find any comprehensive material about it. most of times, youll just need to learn on your own. hex tiles and non-stacking military units resulted in a very strategical militar combat planning, as opposed to the death stcks of the game predecessors. graphics are just gorgeous. sometimes you want to go to war just to watch some swords swinging. soundtracks as always are excelent and immersive. infinite city spawn is sadly still a problem, but much better than the other games in the series. recommended!",169.0
"it will take over your life, but its worth it....if you win!!",176.0
"amazing game but the ai cheats on the higher difficulty ratings. i mean the ai shouldnt cheat it just makes the game feel  when suddenly the ai get 50 units out of nowhere in 2 rounds. but other than that it really is quite a good game 8/10",332.0
"be very careful playing this game!!! you make think you know what time it is, time to nuke gandhi, but you realize that 3 days have passed since you have started your game and you havent drank or ate in the last 18 hours. this game keep you saying just one more turn! but dont let it make your decisions for you, like when you should use the bathroom or when you should get another sandwich. if you see this game on sale buy it immediately, oh and brave new world did amazing things for this game, buy it as well.",133.5

"i dig it. an excellent (if not overly effective) way to pass an entire day without realizing it.",296.1
"an amazing strategy game, would definetly recommend, 9/10",84.4
"this game is not for the faint of hearted, sure there are lower diffuiculty levels but this game is not for the casual gamer. that is the thing i enjoy the most about this game is that you really have to think and the victor is determined by whomever has the best strategy. growing up on civ iii and then civ iv this one is by far the most fun to get into.",106.3
"ive loved every civilization game since i played civilization iii way back in the day. the scope of these games has always impressed me, and civ 5 does not disappoint in this regard. some die hard civ players were taken aback from the hex-combat mechanic of the game, but personally, i think that the change was a step in the right direction, making me not dread waging war with my neighbors (which in previous civ games always felt like a chore.) the base game is fun, but ive found that the two major expansions really have improved the experience (gods and kings and brave new world). brave new world, especially, is an excellent addition to the cultural victory scenarios. civ 5 is the most played game in my small steam collection, and with the wide array of mods and community support, it will probably stay that way for years to come.",295.2

"excellent replayability. addicting, especially multiplayer.",190.3
"this was my first civ game so i cant compare it to past games, but ive thoroughly enjoyed this game since it first came out. each expansion has added a ton to the game. the first gods & kings expansion gave civ v a lot of depth and introduced a lot of new elements, i wouldnt buy any less than the gold edition for a new buyer. then the brave new world expansion added even more, so if youre able just buy it all.",118.1
"i was expecting it to be way more complicated thanks quill18 for getting me into civ this ones fo you man",179.9
"rather honestly, this is my favorite game to play. both with and without online players, i love to play. the freedom to do what you wish and the repurcussions of those actions just make the game that much better. plus its not like the third game where you could practically pump out anything you needed, but the computers could always pump out more troops to you no matter what.",142.3
"easily one of the best strategy games at the moment.",29.5

"great game to play with others or even solo just watch out for just one more turn syndrome. that one more turn can cost you hours! go buy it and play it!",169.5
"such a great game! make sure you have a very powerful processor, or turn-times near the end of the game can take a very long time. really though, if youre into strategy games, this is the best one out.",1081.5
"one of the best strategy games ive played, its also a great game to pay with friends.",368.4
"me and my friends have had hours of fun playing civ!",205.3
"this is one of my favorite games ever. by getting rid of the stack of doom from the previous iterations of the game, it really brought in a new level of strategy, and by making cultural a viable path, it has really added to the series in ways that previoius iterations didnt.",675.6
"honestly, after playing this game for over 200 hours it is great fun. if you like building your civilzation from the ground up, this is your game. the only downfalls of this game are the online. it has a tendency to loose connection from the game and can sometimes delete those worlds. although of the one flaw, this game is great for wasting time in a way. lets say call of duty black ops 3 is comming out in 10 hours, this game is great for wasting that time. the mods for this game also are good. if you are questioning buying this game, you wont be disapointed in a stratagy veiw.",283.8
"you play as the undisputed dictator of your own nation in this fantastic national socialist germany simulator, you win can through other methods like diplomacy but thats no fun.",53.7
"good ole civilization. this is a classic strategic turn-based simulator, however, this one is a little different than the previous civilizations. for starters, you dont choose directly if you want to be a monarch or dictator, instead you adopt social policies that shape these different forms of government. secondly, there is no tile stacking... which kinda blows, but it does make for a more realisitic gameplay. other than that this game maintains its integrity and you will surely lose your soul if you are one of those people that easily get sucked into games like this!",126.8
"this game series, just goes from strength to strength. brilliant!",93.6
"as the astects ride nearer they have brought all there millitary troups to the war they started its six to 2 citys with cannons 1 horseman troup and 2 war chairiot troup witch im pretty sure only egypt can get sinces it one os rameesees abillitys anyway i wipe out more then half and the astrects  out and decide to make a peac treaity wotch i sigh and i know i won because egypt  yea ten outta ten",16.8
"you dont even need to know history well or be great tactician to have pleasure from playing that one.",39.1
"i like this game alot. there are quite a few ways to win at the game and all of them have their own ineresting aspects of it but i do suggest if you get the game to get gods and kings too. the vanilla version has pretty bad ai so their armies could sit att their base during a large part of the game but they get better in the gods and kings expansion. in brave new world it adds onto cultural victory and allows you to benefeit off of money even more. the ai also get more intelligent in the gods and kings expansion as well.",372.2
"addicting!!! watch the clock when you are playing this game because time will get away very easy! the games very good though there are some little things like getting a boat traped when another player buys slots around it and if you move it war breaks out.....but other than that its a very good game if you like board games like settlers of katan this is the game for you! (dont know if katan is the name but it sounds right)",16.4
"this game brings real time strategy to a whole new level. this game is a must buy for anyone who likes rts games.",724.1
"the base game is a little weak compared to civ 4. with both major pieces of dlc (gods and kings, brave new world) however, civ 5 is the best in the series. the playable civilisations are very varied, the diplomacy and faith systems are solid. city-states add an extra element of risk/reward and trade routes are very lucrative. multiple play styles are viable game winners and fun. the only real negative is the high cost of the dlc. overall the game is fantastic and offers huge replayability. a must have for fans of the civilization series and 4x strategy in general.",327.2
"its civ, if you dont know about it youre doing something wrong",33.5
"super addicting. ive never played a game more than this one.",1066.4
"so addicting... starting to even like it more than civ 3. its sad you cant stack troops though.",68.8
"this is a very good and relaxing game. i highly recommend buying this game its worth every cent",66.1
"my brother and i downloaded this game at the same time... i made fun of the gamers that played around 200 hours. then i realized this game was terrible, annoying and it was way to simple of a game. all it wanted was to just be played more, and i had to comply with its demands. i hate it, and yet i continue.",215.1
"ive never been into rts or anything of the sort, so i figured i wouldnt enjoy civilization or similar games. but i was very very wrong. i highly recommend this game! :d",44.9
"if youre looking for a game to joke around with your friends about, this is the one. who doesnt love the great warlord ghandi? a little caveat, though. if you are a history buff, prepare to cry your eyes out at all the inaccuracies. 8.5/10",170.4
"my all time favourite game, strategy that is really easy to get into.",216.2

"built the eiffel tower in sparta, then found oil and the usa declared war on me. only 50% accurate. 5/10",15.0

"having started my civ career at a young age i felt that the game was overly complex and hard to grasp the city management and such. years later i pick up the fifth iteration, and with such happiness, understand now why this game has the lineage that it does. only recently have i invested serious time and i am dumbfounded as to why i havent sooner. grab a couple of friends and start playing. my only issue with this game is that there is no real world clock to make you aware of how many hours youve been sitting and enjoying your time. grab this, the expansions, and go lose yourself.",14.2
"do you not like change? are you a diehard fan of the previous civilization games and dont want to change to this new, dynamic sequel? well suck it up and play it.",98.3
"amazing game if you like strategic turn based games.",96.2
"this game has so much content that you can start playing and not run out of things to do for a year, especially with friends.",106.8
"i used to make fun of people who played this game. but- i was wrong. it is pretty much the best game ever.",138.4
"after doing a few sex favors for a horny gamer girl that ive known since the vietnam war, i finally traded naked pics with an australian mafia to smuggle videogames and one of them was civ which stands for cant into vidya, if only starcraft 2: heart of the quickscope were on steam id be reccomending that instead but civ was made by people who clearly failed middle school world geography because i started as mayans and found the city of venice a few miles or tiles away and those crazy italians tried to culturally enrich my  but i called the powers of montezuma and la muerte peluda to overthrow their , but that wasnt the end because later came the dunegook empire trying to take over my new land and i had to 1v1 quickscope with the arab nerdlord and put them to shame because im american and i still remember the alamo",5.7
"good casual strategy game for people who like to lead.",84.8

"great game, you have to understand the game is great!!!!!! but if you dont know how to play, dont give up instantly... actually try to learn it. if you dont know what youre doing youll love it.",434.7
"fantastic game, i strongly reccomend you purchase the expansion packs however. the game feels incomplete without them.",101.6
"i didnt know if i would like civ or not since ive never played a turn-based game. i am addicted. buy this game",52.2
"this game blew my  off. i now have feelings of ambivalence of whether to sue, or to congratulate the devs on achieving such a feat.",164.7
"bought this in the sale as to, essentially, go back to my childhood of playing it with my uncle and dad for hours on end. bought back all my love for the series, sat and played it for nearly 4 hours instead of going to bed (aka between 2 in the morning and 6 in the morning) would recommend this game (any game in the series especially tot) to anyone whos an old hand at stratergy games and even those that are interested by the genre but never played any of this kind of game before :)",5.6
"probably the best strategy game ive ever played and i am now going to be a long time fan of the series",664.3
"civ 5 is a turn based strategy game. if you need more, i would include board game, as it has many qualities a board game would poses. you start civ 5 by choosing a nation(or a random one). then you will find yourself on a randomly generated continent, where you must order your people to perform tasks, to begin discovering the wheel, expandin your nations borders, trade and war with your neighbors, and finally, either win by building a space ship to travel to alpha centari, becoming leader of the world by the united nations, dominate all other nations with your supreme culture, or simply taking everyone over with your supreme military. if you have hundreds of hours, you alone or up to eleven friends could play together to dicsover if you have what it takes to rule a nation. do you have what it takes, to forge a nation that can stand the test of time?",831.7
"the game is cool, the constant crashes are not. tired everything from updating graphics drivers to playing in windowed mode with dx9, nothing fixes it.",193.8
"this game is great, hours of entertainment, beware giving uranium to gahndi destroyer of worlds",124.3
"well designed. love to play it with friends and family. wish the bots could be persuaded more when it comes to trading when playing soloplayer. otherwise 4.5/5.",125.5
"this game, even without its dlc, is absolutely phenomenal. how many other games let you progress from men with pointy sticks all the way to the nuclear age, while juggling your empires growth and spread, citizen happiness, resources, culture, diplomatic relationships with other civilizations and technological advances? and thats before you get into its dlc which adds tourism, religion, espionage and trade routes. the only flaw is how long it takes to play a game.",134.2
"really fun game...tbs game and from a great maker.",172.7
"amazing game that i would recomend to everyone. everytime i play its for a couple hundred turns before a break. definitely worth it.",24.2

"great strategy game. you can make it as simple or as in depth as you want.",82.8
"this game is awesome! both multipalyer and singleplayer are great. you can play online with teams of friends. and also help each other out by sharing and trading! in single player you can do that too, but not as easily, they have to be your ally. this is a great game that i recommend truly. one of my favorites.",211.6
"10/12 best game. gaben is now a titan, not a god. kappa licked his lips over dis title. serious note here : good for the whole famiry.",71.5
"love the replay value and the interesting aspects in the game. the technology tree, geography, and different civilizations keeps it fresh every play through. a standard game takes about 5-8 hours so you get a pretty good bang for your buck, and its not too hard to learn. i would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of turn based strategy games.",62.4
"civilization 5 (civ v) i s one of the greatest strategy games ever just like all the predecessors. lots of difrent way to play and never ending game time",594.0
"great game for anyone who likes building civs/dominating civs. very good user interface, everything is placed correcetly, everything is balanced. multiplayer is excellent as well, and you will for sure dump countless hours into the game. just one more turn....",407.3
"great game. it is accomidating to both beginners and veterans alike. looking for hours, and hours, and more hours of replay value, this is a great option. and who doesnt love a good sid meier game?",136.0

"you can end a war by giving all your cities to another empire, or win one with the power of religion. so yeah.",183.9
"awesome game, very deep and satisfying! it was worth every penny! very fun to play with friends and alone, but kinda lacks the giant freaking huge maps that the previous games had, in my opinion. but that might just be my brain playing tricks on my! anyway, totally worth it! buy it!!",57.3
"this game is a total blast. you have options for success and a million ways to achieve just that.",30.3
"very good game if you want to pass time like youre doctor who, golden pass more than worth the extra money. this is one of those games that youll play for a week then stop then later on in the sycle youll start again. once again a very good game to pass the time with praticly no effert.",356.8
"this game will devour your time like a greedy child hovering over a cookie jar. when played in conjuction with gods + kings and brave new world this title is everything i love in a turn based strategy; addictive, fun, complicated and fun in single or multiplayer. it improves on many aspects of the previous games and introduces quite a few changes for the better. its a steep learning curve, but once you know what youre doing youll be stomping across the map like the english empire reborn! im just shy of 400 hours game time as i write this review, 95% of this in multiplayer and im not bored of this game at all. if you enjoy games that span a few days, where your decisions really matter and every move can lead you to defeat or victory, buy this game - you will not regret it.",627.3
"damn good, but make sure to get the 2 expansions (god and kings, brave new world) otherwise dont bother.",416.0

"the best civilization game that i have ever played.",168.0
"great game, still playing for hours per week. still miss some of the features of civ4, like slave states, etc. could really use some additional diplomatic options (like demanding surrender, slave states). and what i havent encountered yet in this version, in older versions if a huge empire lost its capital, it split up in two adding a new nation to the game. would be nice if that feature was also introduced again, or in case of unhappiness for a long time, certain cities rebel and form their own nation (which is actually how many nations were formed).",312.4

"i would highley reccommend this game if you are into grand strategy games",78.3
"i have to admit that i never thought i would like this game. i was a die hard civ iii fan (and i still love it). but this game is gorgeous and has some great things about it. i found the hex grid hard to get used to, but after getting used to it, its much more intuitive than civ iiis grid. i actually like the fact that i cant stack a hundred things on top of one another (though ive heard people complain about that) because i keep track of my units better that way. one thing i really dont like is the extra restrictions on movement. you cant even go through an enemys space at all, even to pass through and you ship cant risk dangerous deep water (a gambit i am very fond of in civ iii). other than that, i love this game. it may even be my favorite out of the civilization games.",206.8
"veryy good game. amazing with friends but also very good for playing alone.",524.1
"grand-strategy game that consumes more of your hours than is healthy. just one more turn easily turns into 5 hours. not for people looking for a quick-and-dirty strategy game like starcraft.",183.3

"it took me a long time from buying and downloading civilization v to actually playing it. theres a reason behind it, which is i never liked turn-based games. it took me a long time to actually give this game a try, and boy do i regret that it took me so long. without a shadow of doubt, civilization v is among the best games i have ever played. i absolutely love it.",811.6
"not all sid meiers games are awesome, this goes for the civilization series as well. this one is a must-play if you like turn-based strategy games though. it is really interesting and offers a long play-time, almost never gets boring.",33.9
"this game is amazing. its one of those games that never gets old. wacth out though as youll think that 1 hour has gone by, but really have :)",177.7
"improving every aspect of the civilization formula, this is a must-buy for fans of the series, and a strong reccomendation for just passers-by.",250.7
"do not buy this game. seriously. and thats not meant as a bad thing. once you start playing this game it will just suck up all your free time. it is way too addicting. if you have lots of free time,this game is a must!",31.1
"civilization 5 is a beautiful game full of strategy and horrible multiplayer 0/10 kill it.",345.2
"i absolutely love this game. it is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable turn-based strategy games i have played in a long while with very indepth strategy behind it. however i cannot recommend this game. why is that? i have had a game breaking bug for the past 3 months that has made it impossible for me to get past the opening cinematics. i cannot enter the loading screen and there has been no attempts to fix this glaring issue and i know i am not alone on this. i have even went as far as to try and fix the problem myself, but to no avail. without this and some other completely terribly game breaking glitches i would highly recommend this, but for now i feel somewhat cheated.",213.8
"not hard to recommend, really; it has sid meiers name on it and its a civilization game. oh, and it now uses hexes instead of squares, has a skill tree for social policy and counts roads as part of your upkeep. really, the only downside i experienced was the intense feeling of racial guilt after conquering the iroquois.",273.4

"i played the previously sid meiers civilization 3 as well as this one. i love this game obviously. it is like playing chess but with your civilization at stake. but it is not really realistic because the historicial figures are who they are, not who you are. like for example, some of the famous warlord like genghis khan achieved his empire by letting his mongel enemies join him or die, and the roman empire expanded not because of its army but because of the use of making roads that made it easier for the roman soliders to march on in caesars conquest. the game would be made more challenging if the world leaders were forced to follow their ways rather than change with the todays thoughts on the success of civilization building. if only if we could renact history and see if the gamers could create alternative historical worlds based on the strategies of famous or infamous historical figures.",113.7

"civilization has always been a god tier style conquest game. unfortunately civilization iv added a cartoony feeling that ruined the concept entirely. now comes civilization v, all the goods thing found in iii and iv combined with an awesome graphics overhaul. 5/5",7.7
"absolutely amazing game. love it. you do need to buy at least gods and kings + brave new world to make the game better than civ iv, and the combat is a bit, well clunky, but aside from that it is one of the best strategy games on pc right now. 10/10.",341.2

"really seemed overly simplified. the dlcs are all terrible, and pretty much the only differnce between factions now is a singular special unit (which is what most of the dlcs were). the hex system is okay, but not great, but overall your better off playing the old games, unless you really like casual gameplay. if you want a civ game to play go play galactic civ. much better series of games. overall with the ratings for this game being as high as they are im a bit horrified by the lack of relevent reviews this game recieved. it feels like a stripped down version of previous games with very little new improvements aside from the grid system (which you can only move one unit on a square at a time which many folks like myself hate). overall this game is less then previous civ games in every way i can tell and gives you a civ aftertaste, but no substance to chew on.",6.0
"even without the major dlc, this is a totally awesome game. lots of content, challenging gameplay, tons of civs to play,tons of units,tons of buldings, tons of wonders...yeah its pretty cool. the only major problem is the price, not only for the game but for the dlc, a bit overpriced. wait till a sale and then buy the heck out of it. then buy the dlc to make this game 200% more awesome.",349.2
"sure, it starts out slow, but once you take out an entire nation you know, you just know, that this game was made for you.",71.2
"fantastic game, its a shame that the base game itself isnt the best. the dlc (g&k and brave new world) are basically needed to get the full game experience, which ramps up the price quite a bit. still, one of my favorite games of all time.",171.5
"so deep so amazing. in my first game of brave new world, i guiled my way into the position of head of the world congress, renamed it the unholy satanic confrence of glorious byzantium, forced the world to accept satanism as the official world religion, watched as the various populations of the world adopted my cultures rock music and art against the wishes of their leaders, and eventually was asked by the whole of the earth to step up as leader of world!!! god ing damnit i love civilization v.",670.9
"i love this game. its so much fun even tho games take forever",19.6
"the highly moddable nature of this game really adds considerably to the life of this game. tools are provided to allow users to do anything from adding new civiliations, to changing the ui, to changing game rules and ai behavior. definitely worth a look for anyone who is a fan of turn-based strategy.",504.7
"if you dont have this game.... you have no taste in good games.... or youve never heard of it. in which case, buy it ffs!",114.4

"this games going to ruin my life. calling it now.",4.7
"very different from civ iv, but equally as fun. took me a while before i knew what i was doing, but me an friends playing multiplayer is so much fun. the mods also add alot to the game that the game never did (i.e. stalin, fdr, hitler, middle earth, etc.)",78.3
"fantastic fun, but be warned; its very easy to still be playing 2 hours after youd planned to stop.",30.6
"i didnt think this was going to be my thing, but after realease i had missed two meals while doing my first playthrough it became obvious how well-made this game is. if you like anything about history, turn-based games, or simcity - but dont like cities - then this is the game for you.",14.1
"this game is brill as long as you play with other people, after playing by yourself for a while it starts to get a bit boring.",66.8
"this game is one of the most fun games i have ever played in my entire life and its even more fun with friends. i absolutly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a fun game. also it gets even better when you get the dlc.",9.7
"base game has large amount of content and is very good. brave new world dlc added new breath of life into a game that was staring to get a bit boring, would reccomend buying after getting a feel for the game.",102.7
"a classic that keeps getting better with each iteration. the change of interface and tile-set are welcome features and adding the expansions on top of that gives it an even greater depth that leaves players with a near infinite amount of game time before ever getting bored.",39.3
"pros: great game, and it is lots of fun, has tons of hours of play time. cons: a few small things that are annoying in certain situations.",72.1
"this game will rip your balls off and have you begging for more.",69.6
"at first i was like:yeah this building is nice. but right now i am just starting to discover the game and its ways. strategic thinking is a must, just as patience is. but the game is worth it. the expansions gods and kings & brave new world do make the game a little bit more difficult, but theyre also worth it if youre really into it.",220.7
"this game lets you choose how you want to progress as a civilization. whether you choose to relay on scientific research to develop more efficient mechanisms or you want to build a huge powerful army to eliminate the competition. civilization 5 seems like itd be boring and a waste, but i found it engaging. the freedom of how you progress and solve problems is definately a plus. i like it.",178.8
"probably one of my favorite games. the dlcs are awesome but even the vanilla version of the game is great. 300+ hours over the course of 2 years",367.7
"last time playing civilization 1, now it is civilization v. what an incredible graphic change.",40.5
"speaking from the perspective of someone whos never played the earlier civilization games here. the stories about civ 5 being a great time sink are incredibly true, but i find myself somewhat hard pressed to start up a new game after sinking a lot of time into my first game. just dont expect to be able to please everybody, and dont expect to be able to do all there is to do in a single campaign, and you should do just fine.",184.6

"do not purchase this version of civ v if you intend to run in windows 7, with directx 10 or 11. simply put, ive experienced nothing but crashes every few mintues with the steam digital version of civ 5.",19.8
"while vanilla civilization v was a solid entry to the venerable series, the expansion brave new world really makes the game shine. id go as far to say that civ v: brave new world is a contender for best game expansion of 2013. the expansion reinvents how culture works in civ v and offers more interesting gameplay choices when it comes to trading and diplomacy. the only real criticism you could make is that they shouldve had these in the game in the first place! but thats just the way it is with civ expansions isnt it? :)",618.6
"excellent game. i guess when something gets as much praise from the community as this game has done and continues to so, its well deserved. perhaps my one complaint is that there are not many shipped scenarios; i personally do not like playing against human opponents (i dont trust my skill all that much, i suppose). for more scenarios one must pay a pretty hefty price for the dlc (which of course, despite the price tag, are worth the money). all in all, 4.5 out of 5.",114.1
"addictive as hell once you get into it. fun both singleplayer and multiplayer. be sure to get both expansions.",106.7
"this game is just perfect, as a total war veteran i was a bit put off by the lack of tws real time combat. i thought that id loose interest in managing a single map, well i was wrong. this game is so amazing that even if theyd scrap the combat entirely id still love it. being my first civilization game i found it really easy to get into and enjoy, the expansions are great too, although i didnt have much time to play brave new world yet. i wholeheartedly recommend this game to veteran strategy fans and newcomers to the genre alike.",61.0
"it has a lot of replayability and is pretty good mini hitler simulator. seems pretty balanced, all in all. nukes dont feel nearly as devestating as they should be - late game on a warrior run i tend to toss them out like vowels in a sentence and i never feel like as big a monster as i should be. has the steam workshop too so you have even more crap to stuff in when you run out of love for the vanilla stuff. gods and kings is pretty balanced save for the initial pantheon powers (you have a choice between +10% population growth and other stuff like +1 production - so needless to say, there is no reason to take 90% of what is on the list because there are one or two things that offer bonuses that will actually mean anything late game). still, nothing shattering or bad.",293.1
"im going to try and keep this review short. so ill just start by saying, this game doesnt cease to amaze me. if your interested in buying it, i would highly recomend it. the only downside is multiplayer, which is often secluded from the vanilla version of the game, as out of the servers open for playing, most require mods. but overall, a very good game. it nevers stops being fun, and is brilliant for strategy lovers.",324.4
"holy  balls is that civilization v?! you bet your sweet non dairy  it is! this game is ing hardcore to the max. commit gennocide, brainwash another culture with your propaganda,  space with your giant science ! this game is so ing good you would suck a  to play it, then play it, then suck a  again to say thank you for the game.",42.1
"i spend far too much time on this game. loved them all.",132.9

"the best stratagy game i have played highly recomend to all",29.5
"civ 5, like the whole series, is the biggest timesink ever. you can keep a single game going all day and into the next day. if you like strategy, you really cant do better than civ. if you dont know if you like stategy, you really cant do better than civ. there are ways to customize this game so that its suitable for complete beginners and for serious experts.",142.7
"awesome game, definently recommended for those who love strategy games.",25.5

"definetly finer graphics then 4 and alot more interesting options plays slightyl differently but gods and kings is a fine addition",1.8
"this is definitely one of the greatest games ive ever played. i wouldnt reccomend getting the vanilla version though. with gnk expansion its very good but really starts to shine when you add brave new world. watch out though its really addicting and a single game can take up to like 10h but if you can spare this game some time you definitely wont be dissapointed.",99.9
"you will play 10-20 hours and never pick up this game again, but you sill sure as hell love every moment of it. world domination does that to you.",23.2

"i learned more history in this game than in history class,",67.6
"such an amazing game! lose hours of your life in it.",167.1
"an addictive and time consuming strategy game. would recomend getting the complete edition, as i would guess it might get old a little more quickly without dlc.",79.1
"civ 5 is just a awesome game in general and with its xpacs (gods and kings + brave new world) the game is on steroids... with the introduction to faith / trade routes / tourism / revamped social policies / archaeology / new units are added for every era / more civs / more city states (faith / mercantile) / more luxury resources / more great people (admirals / writers / musicians) spys (engage in espionage and steal other civiliazations tech or make them diplomates and spread propaganda about the wonders and glory your empire is) world congress (vote new laws for the world.. embargo hostile civs or usher in grows in science or art) the game has totally changed in terms of strategy; more angles, more possibilies, more fun!",404.9
"this is simply one of the best games (if not the best game) ive ever played. for new players, the long game span may be quite intimidating, but if you start out on easy with the tutorial on, its very simple to understand. if i were to verbalize every feature that i like about this game, it would probably be several pages long, so ill keep it concise by saying that there is almost nothing i dislike about this game.",324.7

"over the course of the last week i managed to play for one day. the rest of the time the game refused to start. i tried everything from driver updates to windows updates, from restarting steam to rebooting the whole machine... but no, the game doesnt work correctly anymore. there also seems to be alot of people who also have that problem, while others dont. i dunno why that is so and i dont care. if its an error with the program itself, they have to fix it. if its an issue with steam, they have to work wit valve to fix it. since its pretty much gambling wether you can start the game or not, if you dont have the game yet, i would say save your money. also the last civ ill buy for the next years, since i dont trust them to do better with the next one.",256.1
"excellent game, especially when playing with friends. easy to get lost and spend hours and hours in this game, very addictive.",29.4
"i would recommend this game because of its immersion and alteration of history, it is worth the money.",93.2
"you dont think youll play for very long when you start, but then youve got six cities and the ottoman empire is threatening your allies and trying to get on your good side, and you stop playing civ and actually become a world leader with a cry of  what the hell am i gonna do?! as you hover over the declare war button. also its now 4am and you cant remember the last time you ate.",35.5
"dispite the fact of war being a little to server punishement (i dont mind my people mad just i am disappointed that if you go to war every one but you allies and friends will want you 6 feet under) this is a intensly fun game and it is much more intese with mods because, you dont have a clue what to expect. if you want most of the workshop addons though you need g&k and brave new world dlcs but you will still have fun vinilla style.",201.9
"this game is ing fabulous. highly recommended. the gods & kings and brave new world expansion packs are a must have.",435.7
"i have been playing civilization games since i was about 8 and have always been impressed. it has only gotten better over the years. if you like turned-based strategy games with multiple ways and fun interactiveness, then this is the game for you.",126.8
"excellent, addictive game...so many scenarios, and situations to build or conquer, may pull some all nighters for some games.. my only complaints are the multiplayer(its like running the game on the lowest settings) and sometimes the ai is just plain stupid. i highly reccomend this to anyone who likes strategy games!",478.3
"cons: not ready for new mac os maybe stick to pc on this one. i cant recommend becuase it crashes constantly on my brand new top of line imac. the game is awesome if you can play it i have to save my game so often as to not erase hours of moves after a crash this stinks. i think os x mavericks could be casuing this game issues need patching to address the issue which doesnt seem likely from vendor from what im reading this is huge issue just read the reviews on apples app store version same thing.... i have purchased civ iv since v seem like a dud with technical issues. pro: when you can play it it has depth n greatness in redesign. they have taken this to a new level. im a long time player of civ iii on pc i will try and run v on a pc and see if this thing is stable and return to this review to update.",61.6
"civilization v is one of the best games ive ever played. as a lover of strategy, i would recommend this to anybody that enjoy thinking long hours. if you love to build empires, fight wars, and conquer and rule empires, then this is a game for you!",122.0

"do not purchase this game if you want to do anything else. prepare to wonder where the time went, wonder why you havent eaten all day, and wonder what that stain on your chair is. civ 5 is the ultimate time sink, even more so than any illegitimate children you might have. barbies op.",232.2
"i had never experienced being awake through the night until 5am. until i got civilization v. and despite my sore eyes the next day, no regrets.",112.7

"like nukes? like giant death robots? like strategy? good. you will like this game",155.8
"this game is an  plasmated into code. i never truly liked this genre of gaming, but this game changed my mind completely on it. it gives the player a lot of freedom on how he wants to play and getting things done is quick and easy. the game makes you think hard before doing something, as just starting random wars with everyone may lead to a very quick game over. the only thing i can blame this game for are some online problems ive had whilst playing the game, but they arent too bad. it is perfect and it completely deserves to be in your steam library. 10/10",50.3
"a very addictive game. countless hours of (re)playability. the gods & kings, as well as brave new world, expansion packs add so much good stuff, it is strange that some people dont have this game yet. as you can see from the amount of hours played, you will not be disappointed when you buy it. only gripe is that if you play with friends against the cpu in multiplayer, the ai is very stale. furthermore mods are not enabled for multiplayer, although they are for single player though (and irecommend the european and world maps made by the community with true placement). buy it and prepare for hours and hours of fun gameplay!",634.2
"this is an exceptionally great turn based strategy game. i havent played many other games like this but it has encouraged me to. i actually hadnt played the other 4 games in the civilization series and i found getting into the game a bit tricky but with the help of some mates and the wiki i managed to love the game. i ended up creating a relatively awesome empire only to be crushed by a backstabbing friend. so if youre wondering wether to buy this game or not i would recommend you do and buy the dlc brave new world, it adds so much and makes it so much better. buy it, get into the game and start up with your friends.",93.6
"fun fun fun get the game its very fun and you can start a world war and trade with other countries.",28.0
"i have mixed feelings for this game. its great fun but it feels a bit naked without the dlc. multiplayer is where this game shines in my opinion the only trouble with this is that multiplayer is broken... very broken... it seems the developers got half way though and called it a day before they published it. youll be lucky to stay in a multiplayer server without having it backtrack or just stop working fullstop. id reccomend buying this and the addons when it comes on sale. otherwise just give it a miss.",85.3
"great game, good fun and brilliant multiplayer, best with all the dlc.",120.0
"at first i was a bit alienated after playing the 4th game for so long, but after a time it grew on me and with the gods and kings expansion it ended up being definitly the best game in the serie so far.",433.0
"start playing at 12 am, boom, its 3 am. start playing when you wake up, boom, its time to sleep.",32.1
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",316.9
"this is an amazing game. if you like strategy games buy this!",20.9
"so i owned this game for about 6 months before i started playing it. i have fallen in love with this game, whether because i feel like a badass when i crush each little city-state, or because dido is one hot mistress, im not sure. but i would definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes to feel like a badass, and play like a cheat. this game is also a good way to get your brain into a very strategical mindset. after 150 or so hours of playing, im sure i could be a 5 star general. in short: buy this game. stock up on extra food first.",23.2
"having not played civ since my old uni days (many a decade ago) i found the latest iteration simple to pick up and get my hands dirty with, the ui is pleasing and aside from some minor gripes well thought out. gameplay is still addictive and the one more turn ethos still permeates through and it is very hard to put down i havent yet played mp as yet as i am just getting my old head round all the mechanics before i dip my toe into that",104.4
"best game i have ever played 10/10 i recommend espically if you play with friends i had about 20 hours vs ai then about 5 of my freinds got it next thing you know 247 hours its just so much fun and has a huge re-play value.",251.4
"this game has the most replayability i have ever seen. not just map changes, or nations, but how they all interact to produce a whole game. playing this game for over 300 hours and it has never been the same game twice. keeps you on your feet and worth the price.",405.6
"i really enjoy civilization v. exploring the world, building up armies, learning about the different artists and empires. pretty fun!",300.4

"its an exhausting game to play, but once you have the bnw expansion, its also one of the best strategy games youll get your hands on. **edit:** i have now played the game long enough to know what all my quirks with the game is. i still believe its a really good game. for a future civ game, id love to see a pitboss mode that allows you to use a shared steamcloud save, and gave steam notifications when it is your turn, rather than having a dedicated server running hosting the game 24/7 while it is played (which could be months potentially). a pitboss mode like this would be even more attractive if a future civ game was focused more around optimization and lightweight-ness than pretty polygons. the perfect civ would be an epic game spanding several months, where itd take you 20 seconds to sign in, take a turn, and leave the game again.",280.8
"an absolutely amazing turn based strategy game, where you play as a civilization out of the ones available ( the more expansions, the more civs) choose a world type which can be even based on the world itself and work your way up to a modern day of life and even the future. you can go to war or be buddies with everyone. but you must always be prepared in this highly addicting game",112.5

"this game is brilliant. the problem with turn based games is that they can get a bit dull if done poorly. civ 5 does a great job, really only with bnw (brave new world), which is not a point in its favor. however even without bnw this game has enough tension in combat to keep me hooked.",492.3

"great soundtrack, has some sense of education to it for people who are vaguly interested in history. obviously if you play with ghandi he will be historically accurate and stock up on nucleur warheads and put the entire world consisting of 3 continents into a cold war or m.a.d. and when you play as venice make sure you become a real life banker and get loads of bonuses and make sure everyone is denpendant on you for their economy. also the multiplayer experience is not that bad the connections between players can be dodgy so frequent saving is an order, and combat is ok despite the quick animations. if you dont have this game....get it on sale or wait until the next civ gme in a few months....listen to your advisors....exept your military one...dont be like me",540.9

"tl;dr version: civ v on its own: not just no, but hell no. civ v + brave new world: hell yes. this is a review for civ v on its own. no dlc. civ v is easily the worst game in the series. it seems unfinished. buggy. short on content. inordinately dumbed down. insultingly easy. its missing basic core features present in other civ games. ai civs will declare war for no reason. it sucks! but! the brave new world dlc makes it really good. why? it basically adds all the  that should have been present in the game at the very start. bnw also tweaks many of the insultingly crude features that obviously (likely intentionally) werent finalized in the core release.",598.9
"this is a very fun and interactive game. i love how they used real world leaders in the games. nice going sid meier!",31.4
"civlization v is one of those games that becomes very addicting once you get the swing of things. minutes go by like hours, and this game [appears to be] somewhat educational, so i dont feel as bad for playing this game for hours at a time. looks pretty good on directx 11, but will take up a lot of memory on your computer, so having nothing else running in the background is recommended.",131.0
"not worth it. stay with civ 4. i tried to like this game, but its not catching on. civ 4 had more polish and was a very good game, civ 5 even with the expansion packs just does not compare to civ4.",11.6

"i love this game and have dedicated almost 600hrs to it....yeah i know thats kind of sad. the only thing i would have liked to of seen is in civ 4. you started out in the location on an earth map where your civ was historically located. and played through time to see if you could make your civ survive history. thought that would have been nice too",681.8

"in all honesty, a game that is fun for the first few days but got boring really fast. there was no editor and really nothing else to do but the campaign. the mods were fun and entertaining for a long period but also got boring. not game worth 60$ but if they added some extra stuff i would definately buy it for 60$ again.",413.0
"it is a great way to spend your hours of uselessness",20.2
"one of my favorite games of all times, it can be equally realistic and ridiculous and is a definite must buy! i have become a little obsessed with the game and i have hundreds of hours of playtime and have still only scratched the surface of what i can do, and what civs i can play as. you can spend hours developing strategies and plans for the ultimate empire, or just dont give a care and nuke everybody. in my time in civ i have been able to: -take over the world as the might warlord ghandi -get my butt kicked by siam within 20 turns -watch the babylonians burn after they dared to defile me -say that ill only play for 2 more turns and end up playing another 200",780.4
"i think this days that game is the best strategy game in the market! i so like the way how the turn based combat is geting mixed with the pure strategic elements. when you start to play is so hard to finish, because every game you learn some new things. like a new player i miss a bit better tutorial. hardly recommended!",74.3
"ive always been a great fan of the civilization series and have played all of them, except 2, as they came. though no aspects of it are anything id consider too radical from the original ideas, the steady improvments built on the previous versions have made it better and better. if you enjoy these style strategy games, civ v wont let you down.",756.2

"this game is by far one of the best game i have ever played. vanilla is outstanding and is different each time you play, mods make the game more fun by adding new things to the mix, renovating existing ones, and bringing back aspects of other civ games into this one. i never played the older civilization games other than this, but i can say that this game will please every fan of the old civs. while the games are long, taking many hours to get through one civilization, it is immersive and dynamic, and full of surprises from the somewhat quirky ai. i love all 2k games, but this and xcom are tied. if youre looking for a quick fix, civ 5 is not your game. but if you enjoy seeing the hard-earned results of long playthroughs ending in victory, this is definitely for you",254.4
"dont like strategy games, love this one. great game, even for newbies in the strategy genre. really good fun with friends, shame the loading screens take a little while, but it is all worth it to play a relaxing game of civ with mates.",32.3
"one of my favorite games, never get bored of it! 10/10",153.2
"one of my favorite games ever. civ v features such great variety that you can play for 600 hours (like i have) and it still feels fresh. the game is well rounded and each of the victory options is obtainable in an enjoyable fashion. each civ for the most part feels different, and most are tailored to a specific victory type. the ai is strong and on higher difficulties very capable of beating you, however its through boosts not skill.",842.9
"this is a game that just keeps on giving. hundreds of hours into it and still enjoying every match. dont buy it for the multiplayer tho, while it is really fun to play with friends its sadly very broken and has heavy lag that really gets annoying later in the game.",288.4
"fantastic! a very in-depth game with a variety of ways to win. you will find yourself in many different situations that require decisions that are both difficult and unique.",85.5
"there is no reason not to own this game. have played lots of hours with the base game and all the expansions and even if i got tired of it there is a large moc community on the steam workshop.",452.1
"people say this is great, and it really is. i just played it properly for the first time and it turned out that i cant stop playing even when i realised its 2 in the morning and i have school tomorrow. this game is additive. playing it is like selling your soul to a devil or something. i dont think i have a life anymore.",62.9
"sid meiers civilization is the perfect fix for anyone who loves a strategy game. v is just better and more refined than its younger bretheren. it is totally worth the buy, though it must be said, that if you havent heard of civ before this review than you must be a damn barbarian.",187.8
"this game is beautiful. does it really need another recomendation? im sure youve heard of it or seen gameplay. one of hte absolute best turn-based stratgey game. p.s. if you get the gods and kings expansion, be prepared to look at an ugly pubic haired jesus wanna-be staring off into the sunset wandering where his life went wrong every time you start the game up... freaking hated seeing his face.",129.3

"as a massive civ fan, this game was a bitter dissapointment. i wanted to love it. but i cant. a great interface and some cool innovations dont cover the many flaws. ill be sticking to civ iv i think. however, if youre new to 4x games, this is a good place to start. civ v has a much smoother learning curve than any other game in the genre.",433.3

"i love playing civ 5. you can spend hours on this game building your civilisations and making stories for them as well as your neigbours. i like how you play and i like how you can be anyone really... the mods make the game even better and i applaud the mod makers on steam who continue to surprise me with what they come up with. apart from a few crashes every now and then and the sometimes grindingly slow gameplay in later stages of games, i throuroughly enjoy this game and recommend it fro anyone who enjoys building,strategy and/or roleplaying games.",222.8

"this is a very good strategic game. it is a lot of fun, very visually appealing, has a ton of options for how to build your civilizations, and is not too difficult to get the hang of. it does have some issues though. games take a long time. this can be mitigated somewhat by changing settings, but even so this is not a quick pick up and play game. sometimes that is what i like but not always. in addition although there exist ways to win the game without domination over the enemy civilizations, none of those options feel very interesting or satisfying. there are some other minor things here and there i dont like or feel i could like more, but generally this is a very solid game. 7/10",103.6

"very good game, highly recommend, but only if youre going to play in a group of 4+ people. single player gets very repetitive and boring, but in a group of friends, it can get competitive and will last for hours. graphics arent bad, and the view/ controls are simple but more than enough for what you need to do!",40.6

"civilization v is a solid game. not too much more to say. its fun to play vanilla, with many different ways of achieving victory (culture, science, and domination, for example) and no two games turn out quite the same. then when you include mods into the equation, and you get even more playtime and fun. i recently played a match as the kingdom of rohan on an 80x80 hex map of middle earth, and man was that fun. there are also mods that add enhanced functionality, unique units, gui tweaks, and a whole slew of other changes that serve to spice up the experience. definitely a solid pick up. however, id definitely advise getting gods and kings with it at the very least. the gods and kings expansion adds a lot of content to the game that was sorely needed, and they have added even more content to it with the newest expansion brave new world.",34.5
"this is a very fun strategy game and one of the best ive played. it has a more in depth research and construction side to it then most stragety turn based games i have played. plus you can nuke cities as you see fit, icbms are pretty sweet",145.4
"you like strategy? you have a hankering to take over the world and subjugate its inhabitants under your rule? you want to spend the next 5-6 hours of your life doing just that? then this game is for you. if you are a busy person i would not recommend this because it will suck your life away. but hey, if you have some time to spare then i would higly recommend this game. 10/10 would play again.",278.8
"good ol civ. soon it will be cheap to buy, so dont hesitate and give it a try!",123.7
"incredible title! (although i recommend getting all dlcs) a easy to get into strategy game that oozes with fun. you never get bored whether you want to be serious and try to win or have a mess around randomly declraing war on every country it simply does not matter. i recommend waiting until a sale tho. the game with all dlcs (brave new world included) costs a lot if not on sale.",49.7
"one of the best games ever! :d recommended for everyone who wants a strategy game. i mean, everyone!",106.4
"one of if not the best 4x turn based game to date. if you want to play, anything less than all the content would be uncivilized.",1065.1
"built the great wall of mongolia, the eiffel tower of new york, nuked chicago, and went from being besties with bismarck to wanting his head on a plaque hanging on my wall... all in one game. oh, and all that scientific research being done on the possibility of time travel? just play this game, youll jump forward pretty quick. 10/10 would nuke chicago again",74.2
"the civilization 5 gold edition rocks.(i have just begun playing brave new world) the only thing i have a complain about is that why is there a future tech? i personally am a fan of civilization 3.the reason being it has a bit of a science fiction side to it(technology wise).when are they going to make some thing parallel to it i wonder.but civ 5 is good too.it has religion and espionage.one thing that bugs me why is the espionage branch unlocked late in the game?but other wise its good as it is.i give it a solid 8 out of 10.",1.8

"extremely addictive and engaging. and if you think youve done it all in the vanilla game, add ons like brave new world changes the gameplay and victory conditions dramatically. by the very virtue that ive clocked in 260 hrs on the game says a lot doesnt it. but dont just take my word for it. give it a try. youll definitely have no regrets. :)",298.1
"im just gonna do a quick match -10 hours later- i cant feel my legs !!! 10/10 would chop off my legs",21.7

"this game is the best.i thought who the heck would want to play a game with turns but when i played i loved it so much it kept me hours on end with so much stuff to it you dont have to play civ 4,3,2,1 just play civ 5 and you will have fun and get brave new world dlc it would make it more fun",116.9

"just... one... more... turn. im with the civ franchiese since civ i back in the 90. this is simply the most beautiful and easy game of the series. its like never-ending fun, with so many different strategies and possibilities, you can be sure you wont play the same way twice. also, many mods. cool mods. lots of cool mods like new civs or policies or maps or like everything. and lots of achievements. also, poland can into space!",270.7
"really awesome game! especially when you play it with your friends.",61.0
"great soundtrack, has some sense of education to it for people who are vaguly interested in history. obviously if you play with ghandi he will be historically accurate and stock up on nucleur warheads and put the entire world consisting of 3 continents into a cold war or m.a.d. and when you play as venice make sure you become a real life banker and get loads of bonuses and make sure everyone is denpendant on you for their economy. also the multiplayer experience is not that bad the connections between players can be dodgy so frequent saving is an order, and combat is ok despite the quick animations. if you dont have this game....get it on sale or wait until the next civ gme in a few months....listen to your advisors....exept your military one...dont be like me",540.9
"this is a great game, and a great addition to the civilization saga. i have spent many days playing solo and with my friends, and will spend many more in the future. if you are a fan of stratagy games/ rule the world games then civilization v is for you. with many different ways that you can win this game has something for everyone. you can win a scientific/space race victory, a diplomatic victory through votes in the un, cultural victories, and of course you can just pound your enemies into the ground under the boots of your soldiers. the unique units/buildings as well as the special perks that each nation recieves makes this game interesting no matter who you play as. all in all i would give this a two thumbs up rating and now i think i might start playing myself.",391.9

"just started the game, but im already getting hooked.",70.9
"you begin to play your first game of civ 5, curious. after a few hours, you are pleasantly surprised. you finish, and you are addicted. this game will consume you. its strategy... you say to yourself, attempting to justify the days you spent attempting to keep ai citizens happy. 100+ hours later, you look back and wonder, why didnt you just play tf2? 10/10 must buy immediately.",217.0
"remember the good ol days of playing age of empires for hours on end, and still barely scratching the surface? well now imagine that you do the same thing but you havent even seen the surface yet. civ v is one of the best, and in-depth, strategy games ive played. its a classic example of oh ill just play for an hour or so and the next thing you know the sun is rising and youve been up all night declaring war and toppling empires. highly addictive, enormous fun, and multiplayer is brilliant, even locally. this game is worth whatever the price tag says.",16.2
"this game is just awsome! civv worths every cent that youll spend with it. the strategy is complex at the same time its easy to understand the basics -thanks friendly interface, you rock -, basically you will develop hour by hour your gameplay untill you see yourself completly in love with this game. the fact that this franchise uses the turn gaming style makes civv the best game for who just dont like the crazy speed of aoe or starcraft. ps: this is awsome to play at work, as you can minimize the window and stop playing without getting killed or losing smtg. my recommendation about civv?: -why are you still reading this and isnt playing the game? hahaha",161.2
"the best turn based strategy game you will ever play! not only is it a massively multiplayer game with workshop integration and dlc, but it also has a spice of education involved in it. at the start of a match, you will get a little history on who youre playing as (bismarck, washington, etc.). civ v has a massive community and will always be worth the price. you dont have to get the dlc, but if you want play with your friends who have brave new world, id suggest getting the gold version because its 100$ worth of dlc simplified to whatever the price is now. i strongly reccommend this game to and history junkie or someone who just needs a new strategy game every now and then.",42.2
"you can play this game for hours at a time. honestly you lose track of time as you head right through the game into the modern era. 66 hours is a lot if you ask me and thats how long you can spend time playing this game. they did a great job with the game. my only complaint is the automatic camera movement. it can get annoying at times and you might accidentally move your unit to the wrong spot because of it. other than that is an overall great game and i reccommend it to everyone who loves turn based strategy games.",97.7
"its fun but has a ton of achievements and long games. i suggest a guick game which can be chosen in set up game. the first difficulty is really easy and i suggest starting on a higher difficulty like 3.",54.8
"very rarely does a turn-based strategy game appeal to me, but damn, i cant get enough of this game.",25.8
"not much else needs to be said after you see that ive played this game for almost 700 hours since it came out. im a huge fan of civilization and have played every iteration since the first. each has built upon the last and i cant wait to see if there will be a civ vi sometime in the near future. a turn based strategy classic that will remain in my top 5 of all time.",1027.9
"get drunk and invande small european countries because they wont give you a few gold.",360.9
"civilization v is a fantastic turn-based strategy. ive personally have been a fan of the series for a long time and this is by far the best one. there is many different modes to play and multiple ways to win and no two games are ever alike. there is also a ton of mods for this game! so check out the workshop. you will easily lose hours to this game and i cant keep track of how many times i say just one more turn and never realize how late it is until after the fact. if you dont own this game already you are seriously missing out.",185.7
"civ 5 is a fantastic game. the graphics are nice, gameplay is smooth and all factions/countries are balanced. i would recommend this game!",46.0
"its a great game full of adventures and upgrades. you can research really excisting projects and monuments. it looks a bit like age of empires ii, but i think this game is more fun (and more expensive).",548.8
"this game is one of my favourites of all time. having racked up plenty of game time, its clear, from my point of view, that the game is addicting and will chew through hours and hours of your free time once you start playing. 10/10, would buy.",459.6
"10/10 one of the bests strategy games out there and the dlcs are great too you must play it",315.8

"ive put more time into this game than most so id say im qualified to write this. i really enjoy the gun attachments and the killstreaks. however, the nudity is very excessive and overblown. id rather jerk off my grandfather sometimes.",41.0
"civ v is one of those games that you want to play a little bit after dinner and then you realize its almost breakfast. with all the expansions, this game is so vast, so varied and with so much written into it you wouldnt even scratch the surface 100 hours of gameplay later. i highly recommend it for people that arent strategy fans too  playing in an lower difficulty still gives you an enjoyable experience from end to end.",132.6
"youll make the choice to play for a single hour, then before you know it five days had past and your girlfriend left you, but youre on the brink of killing ghandi is doesnt even matter.",50.0

"compared to other civ titles #5 leaves you wanting, that maps never set up like you tell them to (eg. earth, terra) and the flow is sluggish..... 1/5 stars 1-gfx no playability - repetative no story..... controles are not user friendly, and the help tips dont provide much info ai cheats, still cant beat me, but it cheats, sure they can propse unbalanced deals and expect me to take them but then when i make the same offer they always refuse sayng its not a fair deal and thats garbage if i clearly overpower them they should be fear me and take anydeal that downst involed me killing them.........",94.4
"i stopped wearing towels as a sign of rebellion to my master gandhi 11/10 ign",201.7

"good stratagy game, and a good time sink. always find myself playing longer than i thought i would. if you like other civ games you will like this one",89.2

"its an old, but still great game. lol jk, it sucks hard  lol jk again. 8/8 would review it again",45.9
"it is one of the most addictive, entertaining games i have ever played",25.8

"always an awesome game, but one that i like to marathon instead of splitting into too many sessions. i wish it had a notepad where you could leave notes to yourself on what you were planning next.",79.6
"wow, i didnt think id like this so much, im glad i bought it. 10/10",69.5
"new installment in civilization series. now with hexes!",790.1
"with the two expansions, civ v is a brilliant 4x game, perhaps one of the best out there (although i couldnt say; i dont have a lot of experience with the genre). an epic strategy game with an accessible learning curve but a very high skill (and knowledge) ceiling, with hundreds of different techs to research, distinct units for different eras, a functional diplomacy system, stellar religion and covert ops mechanics and big- nukes made better with friends. just make sure you pick up brave new world and gods and kings with it, because without it the game feels bare-bones.",117.2
"one of the best single players games out there. once you get some friends to play with you it is 10 times better, but its still amazing either way.",374.2
"a really pleasing and exciting strategy game that i highly reccommend. 9/10",392.2
"nothin like a good ol 16 hour game of civ on a rainy day.",43.9
"fantastic game, better with the expansions. so fun to play.",145.0
"best turn based strategy game ever made. i have played over 1000 hours of civ 4, and while people like to say it is the best i dissagree. civ v with all dlcs is by far my favorite. besides crusader kings 2 it is the deepest strategy game that is also enjoyable.",251.7
"a truely addictive game , the game contains so many awesome moments like when you get surround by enemy troops as you fight them to your last unit and you legendery civilzation has been vanquished... or vice versa you take out a powerful might foe and you add his city to yours and then set off for the world... such moments make this game a classic if you dont own this game ... just buy it already!!!!!!",42.0
"one of the most addicting games ive ever played. this game is a must for anyone who loves strategy games. i highly reccomend it.",115.0
"there arent many games that can keep you interested for much time. this is surely one of them. truly a masterpiece. there are so many ways to play it, especially with bnw expansion. whether you focus on army, diplomacy, religion or tourism, you will be astonished and youll never be bored. america founded relgion: taoism 100/10",91.5
"i love this game by far the best game you can get for wartime fun. the strategy that goes into building your empire up and making everyone happy and fat with food. after you build it up i normaly shot for a fight to death to see who wins and its epic the way you feel after beating the  out of your bff in multi player.",538.6
"if you want to play civ 5, suck it up and buy brave new world. it adds the religion system from g&k(you dont the few extra civs) and fixes cultural victories. bnw is what civ 5 should have been on release.",231.8
"if you like previous entires in the series, youll likely enjoy this one as well. the fourth game still stands tall as my favorite, however civ v is a pretty fun entry. sometimes it feels like it could use a little more depth, and id like some advancement beyond the information age, but overall im quite happy with the game.",30.7
"the game is so much deep and lot of mod to keep you have fresh experience everytime",50.5
"this game is great for strategists. youll sink in hours and hours of time into this game and will never be bored. just one more turn, one more turn. thatll be the chant you repeat everytime you make a move.",56.4

"just 1 more turn always turns into 3 oclock in the morning lol . brilliant game .",64.4
"a fantastic stradegy game that allows you to take the role of almost any civilization and allow your to take them thoughout the entire history of time. its very avaible for newcomers and even caters towards long time fans. its appeal it aweosme it its almost impossible to stop playing. howeve the only issue is that the expansions are waht really makes the game fantastic. the base game is godd but it doesnt compare to the amazingness of the expansions.",90.8
"the game is good but alot of buggy especially brave new world dlc..... wasted usd 29.9 on a piece of crap.",105.2
"civ v is a game that i would recommend for anyone interested in strategy games. the building of your own empire is something i had been looking for in a game for a long time, and the fun only grows if you can convince your friends to play along!",483.3

"another great civ game from firaxis, sure to keep you busy for years to come. some good improvements over civ 4 while remaining faithful to core civ mechanics.",542.2
"one of the more addicting games out there. you will find yourself thinking i will play until i reach the renaissance and hours later realize that you have tanks and that they were definitely not around during the renaissance. my main criticism is that for the game to really shine, it requires the purchasing one of the expansions in addition to the base game. the base game alone is a bit strategically bland compared to civ 4.",609.4
"after a lot of patch and fixes, this game is finally incredible ! browse the workshop for useful and fun mods (such as doge as a nation) this game is as tasteful as fried potatoes with pop corn and bacon !",254.3
"the best thing i liked about this game was the realistic approach towards battle and improvements in a country of your choice. if you have the dlc for this game it gets even better! not only does one understand and go through a learning process since the beginning of time and how war was waged and how countries and small states had alliances with each other but you get to make your decisions and they effect you in the long run. you can play a short game starting from the nuclear era and nuke cities and civilizations or you can go back all the way when iron and coal was found and work your way up into a new era! superb game with great and realistic rulers, buildings, monuments, wonders and warfare. a must if you like strategy games or were a fan of games like generals. but believe me, this is way ahead of generals or any civilization game you have ever played !",34.3
"a really good game! the single player is very good and the multiplayer is even better. but its the dlc that really makes the game come alive. the mods dont always work.",116.4

(during single player, its actually quite quick). i disliked it a lot at first, and there is a learning curve. just sit through the tutorial and mess around a bit, it grows on you. works great on most pcs, and you dont even need a mouse to play since it is turn-based. i highly recommend it!",267.2

"just amazing, turn based, think ahead strategy game. when on sale, its really worth your money.",161.2
"civilization 5 is an amazing strategy game with no equal. the game can be played at a leisurely pace and comfortable difficulty all the way up to a mind melting marathon pace and the extremely challenging deity difficulty. not only are the single player games fun, challenging, and well crafted, but the online multiplayer adds a new dimension to the game with added challenges and excitement. lastly the scenarios allow you to reenact some of historys greatest moments. 10/10.",417.0
"this game is honestly one of the best games i have played. 10/10 would play again!",66.5
"awesome game, great turnbased combat. love the different victories and variety of civs and leaders you can play. great time sink, which is to say that this game will take hours to get through one playthrough. but you can save and whatnot so why not? yall just gotta go rambo style and play mongolia ya dig?",122.7
"this game is simply amazing! i def give it 5 stars.",12.0
"many annoying little things, but overall, pretty fun strategy game.",444.7
"civilization v should be any and everyones turn-based strategy dream game. its been sharpened to the fine edges of perfection, you find yourself repeatedly saying... just... one.. more... turn! a good investment of your money.",95.7
"i buy game. i like game. i love game. you do anything to my game i hate you. i hate you i invade you. you ghandi. you nuke me. i invade you. you nuke me. im sad. 10/5 best game",299.6

"buy this and the brave new world expansion 7/10 civ v 9/10 civ v+ brave new world",620.7
"great for strategist and history-buffs alike. win with war, culture, technology, and stylish creativity.",79.2
"the game is a blast in multiplayer. i highly recommend this game for groups of friends to play.",68.3
"best strategy game ive ever played pros= +looks great +handles well +great modding community +basic controls +addictive cons= - you will lose so much time to this game (i booted it up for the first time thinking ill let it install then play another game. i didnt play another game for about three days. i just did homework and played this game",5.1
"i have played this game for so long, but yet it does not get boring. you can keep on starting new games and it will always be different. with so many civilizations to play, it is almost impossible to get sick of this game. i highly recommend it.",306.5
"wow. civilization v. probably one of the funest games i have played. you need to make important decisions all through out the game. think simcity with combat, and much much much more. this game allows you to rule your very own empire. i suggest and recommend getting the complete edition because this includes so much more things to do, which makes the game play so much more detailed and dynamic. be warned. a standard game on this will take around 8 hours. this isnt a game you can simply pop onto and leave, it is extremely addictive and enjoyable!!! get this game if you love tactical games!",119.0
"this game is really addicting and well worth the $13.74 cad, keeps you busy and has many options to chose from and more than one way on how to play the game. the complete edition is what i got and its very fun to play. the only annoying parts i see in the game is when you use any nuclear bombs near a mountain the fallout stays there and you cannot use any of the workers to clear it. perhaps theres a mod to get rid of it? i kinda only wished there was more civilizations to pick from when youre setting up the game because with only few to pick some even with the dlcs. it seems like theres a lot more missing that the game could had placed in. this game is one of my most favorite games on steam right now. im glad i got to purchase it when it was only 60-70% off.",103.6
"awesome game. warning! this game will cause loss of track of time , also extream fun and addivtive!",60.5
"good enough to be called a civilization sequel, combat has changed to a strategical-tactical-like kind, culture victories/small empires are more viable, along with city-states for diplomacy-based games. the only real bad thing is the ai, which must make up for poor play with cheats, discounts or starting advantages as you play a higher difficulty.",118.0
"this game is quite a damn classic and it is one of my favorite games whether you like playing against ai or human players the modding community is really great as well huge variety of mods",31.9
"as i sat there. i thought to myself, how did this happen? it was me versus my friend. he had pikemen. i thought uh oh and then suddenely out of nowhere my fighter plane came and shot at him then i nuked all five of his cities at once. he cried for three days after that. 10/10 would nuke again",153.4
"i though this was the worst strategy game ever... i was wrong! with the brave new world this game is one of the bests. it is hard to learn and boring to wait turns but diplomacy, war, trades, civilization... every single this is great. buy it.. no no wait... buy both civi 5 and the next game: beyond earth...",24.7
"best epic game ever, i have been playing this game since 1998! love it and probably always will but just like in the great shel silversteins - the giving tree, like the old man i keep running out of time but the game is always there to play.",233.7
"i may never stop playing this... i needed food. food is all that is left to distract me. so by all means, buy this!",23.9
"my favourit game to d8! just got it and already i played for 8 hours! probaly going to be playing this all summer!",97.3
"excellent game. i cant say anything that hasnt been said probably a dozen times already, so i will just give civ5 another thumbs up.",981.5
"by far the most solid and comprehensive game of the series. solid interface that is more intuitive than past games while still maintaining content and features. with the expansions, this game will find any fan of turm-based strategy games many hours of entertainment.",107.4
"best damn time machine on the planet. you start playing this and then bam! 12 hours of your life just went away.",321.6
"handsdown my favorite game on steam... im always up for a game of civ v. do you like history? youll love civ v... you hate history? you can change it in civ v. its like the best game ever... its the best game... its the best... trust me... youll love it.",825.2
"i really went out of my comfort zone when i asked for this game as a gift, and i must say that i love this game. fairly engaging, good depth, and countless ways to go about tending to your civilization. +++ recommend buying for all types of gamers!",104.5
"i could easily lose my entire life to civ. makes for strange conversations trying to explain to people whats happening, so worth it.",31.9
"this is the best turn-based stratagy i have played in a long time. the depth of the diplomacy systems is incredible and makes it feel far more realistic than any other game in its category. the variant victory types allows a large range of freedom in what you can focus your empire on. the tech system is amazing and makes sense, the culture system is undescribably better than anything like it, and the advisors give usful, if reppetitive, advice. can you build you empire to dominate the world?",150.0
"humanity is destined for great things. sadly, if you buy this game you wont get to see what great things were destined for. after purchase youll open up to see what its about. next time you look at the clock two months will have passed and your life will have collapsed. on the upside you beat ghandi. 10/10",64.6
"besides my constant crashing its a pretty fun game",55.6
"havent played it much, i need brac  dlc to play with nick and collins... what the  i buy the game 5 dollars 6 years ago dont know hwo to play why did i eeven install it? 14/14 - its alright",15.3
"this is the type of game that you start playing around 8 pm and not realize youve been playing for 6 hours until you look at the clock. a+.",366.3
"this game also doubles as a time machine 5 hours longer than you wanted to play in the future.",11.7
"this game crashes constantly. i am a huge fan of sid meier and the civilization franchise but i cannot even finish a match because the game crashes halfway through",10.7
"highly addicting. i downloading on a whim and was actually stuck playing the game. i rarely get stuck playing games but was glued from the beginning.",38.5
"if you like strategy this game is for you! it is the perfect game if you like forming a civilization and conquering the world in many different ways",117.6
"this game is so much fun but very addicting. people be like  i wanna play a first person shooter and glak people up, i dont want to read charts and graphs and . screw people who say that. this game is amazing. you will start and end up playing a 10 hr game which isnt bad considering an average game on fast mode is like 7hrs long. playing is so much fun and you will have a bunch of rememberable moments in every game. playing with friends or random people is fun and competitive. its basically a board game that is a perfect strategy game. buy it because it is a great game 10/10 easily. many hours will be put in and it is worth the pay.",79.2
"bought this game about 2 weeks ago, can barely put it down. this game is really fun and has alot of playtime to offer. overall immortal is pretty insane. scouts turn into archers and maria theresa is overpowered. 10/10",69.9
"i played this game for a little while and i loved it. there is a lot of strategic gameplay and several different ways to win and many foes to face on your adventures.",10.8
"never before has gandhis personality been recreated as faithfully as in this game. declare war,  es. stay classy, gandhi!",139.2
"reviews are subjective. civ is a slow paced, turn based strategy, if you like strategy and dont mind spending an evening playing a single game, then give the game a shot. civ does have some aspects that cater to players who prefer shorter games but realistically this is for those of us with high attention spans. i enjoy it and think it is a solid game, there are obviously things i dislike and negative aspects but again reviews tend to be too critical of utterly banal things so i will avoid that and just say i like it, if you have the money and you like strategy, try it out. if not, no huge loss :)",106.3
"i recoment game for guys with addiction to drugs and chemics, these last will be easy song in compare to civ game",83.0
"worth the hype. this is my first civ game, so keep that in mind (although i have sid meiers alpha centauri). easy to get into, and incredibly addictive",33.8
"all the usual reccomendations. old game by now but still solid, especcially with expansions and dlc.",653.9
"ever feel the need to re-arrange everything that happened ever? this is a good way to spend 30 hours doing it in one sitting, only to be crushed by ghandi.",28.8
"sooooo many hours poured into this game, ive forgotten what the sun looks like",454.8
"this game is one of the most fun games i have ever played in my entire life and its even more fun with friends. i absolutly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a fun game. also it gets even better when you get the dlc.",9.7
"takes about 48 hours to understand about an eigth of it, but wow, rewarding as ever. extremely good game.",12.7
"just. awesome. anyone who missed the humble bundle for this... you should be",102.3
"so i owned this game for about 6 months before i started playing it. i have fallen in love with this game, whether because i feel like a badass when i crush each little city-state, or because dido is one hot mistress, im not sure. but i would definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes to feel like a badass, and play like a cheat. this game is also a good way to get your brain into a very strategical mindset. after 150 or so hours of playing, im sure i could be a 5 star general. in short: buy this game. stock up on extra food first.",23.2
"an awesome game. i dont recommend to the restless.",638.1
"had a hard time getting used to the new way of playing after civ2, 3 and 4 really like the game",232.7
"civ v: a game of choices. will you be a massacre. a dipolmat. a cultural genius. you can build your own empire and make it survive for 1000s of years. however i recommend you get the expansions they are ideal.",289.6
"great game. played from 5pm to 10pm when i first got it. its just that great.",38.7
"awesome turn based strategy game, not very demanding and looks beautiful. i really recommend it! ghandi is love ghandi is life.",57.4
"excellent game, a few minor mechanic bugs but all in all a solid game to compliment the series. cant wait to see the next installment.",70.5
"civ v is the type of game you play with the intention of finishing in 20 minutes. civ v then laughs at you and makes you kneel before it as you play until dawn. civilization 5 is an amazing game, it reminds me of when i used to play command and conquer zero hour. civ v is packed to the brim with content, every time you play you learn something new. if you have some money, you should definitely pick up civ v next time it goes on sale.",27.1
"amazing game!!! got it during a sale for around $12 and can honestly say i would have paid the full $60! this is the first civilazation game ive played but really got me intrested in the series and i cant wait to see where it goes. reccomend for anyone who wants to feel like their creating history!",74.7
"ive always loved the civ games. the new additions in this version do not dissapoint. its a challange to try in win in many different ways and with many different leaders.",42.4
"if you enjoy playing risk or settlers of catan, pick this game up. it sets up compelling, friendship destroying conflicts that will have your group debating for days.",130.3
"is an awesome game! when you start it, its hard to stop!",125.5
"live the life of scrooge mcduck and play as venice",106.2
"lots of fun. the single player is the best thing ever, even tough multiplayer is even better. you start slow but soon enough you create the greatest empire in the world. takes a long time to figure out how to play but this game is going to be played for a long time. you will see me play this a lot.",50.6
"first turn based strategy game i actually gave a good go, ive always liked rts instead. i was expecting to not like it much as it has turn based military battles, however to my surprise i really loved it. i still dont really like the military side, but there is so much else to do and many different ways to win. ive clocked over 200 hours on this game and i feel ive only completed a fraction of what there is to do. would highly recommend this game.",223.4
"kinky stuff 4 kinky people. side note: get bnw it makes the entire game two times better.",119.1
"great fun civ v has great single palyer and for me runs smoothly. however multiplayer on the other had is terrible. you cant stay in a single, well functioning game for more than 10 turns at the most. i would recommend for people who will play it single player but would recommending not buying it for multiplayer until a patch is released.",626.2
"i am reviewing this game. you should purchase this game should you possess the required funds.",248.5
"great game, but there are some features frome the last game i wish that they intergated into this one.",431.3
"i love this game its fun this is my best game ever",67.6
"civilizations enthralling gameplay captures even the most pedantic gamers taste. the many various ways of developing your civ make the game so compelling to play. it never gets boring and monotonous. well it depends on ones individual preferences but civ 5 will always have a special place in my heart. =)",42.7
"an amazing board game style video game with a bit of history. the graphics and gameplay are both high-quality by far! i love the ai interaction. no matter how you look at it, it is a great game! i highly reccomend playing it, and you can just do soooo much with it. you can never really predict the outcome until it arrives!",114.2
"it took three years, but civ v has finally gone from the unplayable, bug-ridden horrifically balanced turdfest that it was when first released to something almost as good as civ iv bts in some aspects, and better than the previous game in many others.",238.3
"always been a civ fan and couldnt wait for this game. sadly it was a bit bland and slow, but it seems the staff changes have made all the difference with the last expansion pack brave new world really picking up the slack. its like they just threw in everything the fans wanted. the mod community is amazing, i couldnt play without mods now. some of the fans have done a great job to enhance what is already a really fun game. if they keep the cutrrent direction the new civ games will be great. ...just one more turn...",184.1
"play gandhi and rule over the world with nukes / play against gandhi and get rekt. 10/10",65.0
"gandhi accepts peace agreement 2 turns later nuclear war.... 10/10 would play gandhi again",111.2
"great game. i have played a few of the civ games and liked them to varying degrees. civ 5 though has probably the best all around game play though. i thoroughly enjoy both the long and short run games. the workshop makes the game even more fun. i also highly recommend all the dlcs as they add a lot of unique features that increase the playability of the game and various scenarios that can be quite challenging",332.6
"just 1 more turn is what you will say after every turn of any game of civ v. this game is very fun for you turn based strategy fans.",421.9
"this is a vast game, with the highest replay value of any other i have ever played. the differences among civilizations range from slim to huge, and they all have a very unique style of gameplay. put in the many factors that can be modified before a game session, such as map size and resource abundance, and youll find yourself living with this game for a long time. big points for the soundtrack and graphics as well. the ai is really well adjusted too, compared to older versions of civilization. it is now possible to actually stand a chance playing in the hardest settings and still feels rewarding if you lose and yet tried your best. there is nothing left to say other than... play this game!!! oh and get the expansions too!",135.8
"this is ammmmmaaaaazzzziiiinnnnggggggg! its so cool, but it also has a little bit of historical content in it. i think if you can you should deffinetly play this game.",125.7
"awesome game take alot of hours out of your day easy to get hooked all round good game 9/10",13.3
"top 5 best games ever! with all dlcs its even top 3 imo endless replayability. every gamer should have this in their collection or at least have tried the demo. go on give it a try...",109.5
"very indepth and challenging lots of fun, a good way to pass the time.",218.6
"one of my most played games. bought it during the winter sale and cant seem to stop playing it",193.2
"new to the civ world, and also the realm of real time strategy games but, i have thoroughly enjoyed the past few sleepless nights dedicated to building empires and watching others fall. one of the best games ive played in a while. looking forward to countless more hours of gameplay, the possibilities are endless with this game.",164.2
"o ffs i had a life a few hours ago. i dont anymore...",102.8
"one of the best turned based games ive had the pleasure to play. it runs well though i have had more crashes than i hoped for. the game is fun with friends but can take a lot of time but you can always save it. the only problem i have with (apart from the crashes) is that to fully enjoy the game, you will have to get the dlc, gods and kings and brave new world. though its worth it.",175.3
"like the era that go by in this game so wil the hours in your day, if you play this....",167.1
"great strategy game for anyone who has a little too much time on their hands",379.9

"started playing at 3 pm, suddenly i realize its already 1 am.",66.4
"get it. you can be assyria and develop the nuke. you will enjoy it.",144.3
"depending on who you ask, the civilization games are either very complicated, or babbys first turn-based strategy game. as a person in the former camp, who doesnt really play a lot of games in the genre, the in-game help and highly customizable difficulty levels do a terrific job of flattening the learning curve for newcomers.",80.2
"super fun and addicting. never thought id have this much fun with a turn-based strategy game.",55.0
"civivilization 5 continues to improve upon this amazing franchise in small and wonderful ways. the addition of the policy trees is one of my favorite because it allows more control over the way your empire grows and gives your civ more personality than it could have in previous games. diplomacy, combat and the tech trees have all seen improvements as well as a significant upgrade in graphics quality. the two large expansions for this game, gods & kings and brave new world also add a huge amounts of complexity and depth to the game that was lacking in the former titles.",397.7
"amazing strategy game with hours of fun to be had, either playing solo or with friends. for the full experaince i highly recommend getting the dlc for this game as it truly makes all the game mechanics complete, but the core version is still fun nonetheless. if you like strategy games that drain your time, this is a must have game.",449.9
"very good game. sort of like age of empires but with turns",246.9
"the best civilization game yet! lots of annoying micro management removed to make the game much more simplistic (in a good way), countless improvements, plenty of dlc, built in mods database, lots of civilizations to play all with unique units. favourite civ game to date. :p",128.7
"an amazing grand statagy game, i could go on forever about how fun this game is. i feel that this is the most accesable of its genre and has the most content. the game allows you to choose what you want to do as the leader of your own empire. you can dominate the world as a warlord or create peaceful treties with foriegn nations. this game has so many vastly different civilizations and map variations to chose from. moding capabilities also add much aditional content. if your someone like history such as myself you will love the scenarios mode which allows you to live out famous battles or events in history. i feel that once you have knoweldge of the games victories, and civilizations the game is best ejoyed with firends, this is bery easy because of local games wich allow one of you to host and game and play togather. this game has so many amzing features and is accesable to everyone 9/10.",144.9
"epic - if youre not that in to fps games and such and like a good thinker and strategy with a civilization thats constant developing their tech to kill an enemy or get loved by the ppl then i recommend that you buy this game now while its on sale on steam!!!",95.8
"ive always wanted to fight gandhi with nukes, and so has he. this game was made for the two of us.",79.5
"i will write this in a minute  just one more turn  if you know that feeling then this game is definitely for you :d",27.9
"a real turn-based strategy, balanced your civilation with military, diplomatic, religion, technology and social policy. own the world, win the game.",50.2
"all i need now is a new alpha centauri game, and ill never have to buy another strategy game again.",302.8

"little too different from the good old original games",18.4
"accidently spent 13 real-life hours on one game 10/10 would get nuked by ghandi again",191.1
"while not as good as civilization 4, still a worthy title for the civ franchise and the expansions make is much more deep.",116.3
"this is a great game that i could play for hours and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to play it.",130.5
"this game is a 10/10. a brilliant masterpiece. time literally goes out the door playing this fantastic game.",103.5
"cliche joke about something bad in the game that i find funny 11/420",320.7
"i cant even describe how amazing this game is!!! if you like history, alt. history or just having power, this is the game for you!",854.1
"recommended requirements: no children. no wife. no life.",13.0
"i wont lie, after playing civ iv, i miss stacking an army of units and sending them all on one space to crush my opponents. and i miss not being buddhist, because spain would always get buddhism, and then they would hate everyone who wasnt buddhist, but they wouldnt let them become buddhist, so i had a really great excuse to convince everyone to destroy spain. i kind of miss tech trading, but i remember thinking that was a cheap way to become all-powerful. other than that, this is an amazing game.",84.9
"it is no good without the dlc, if you are going to get gods and kings+brave new world, then go for it, otherwise, no.",181.3
"amazing game, have already sunk in almost 400 hours to this baby and regret none of it.",341.8
"this game is pretty fun with friends, and the single player if pretty based.",45.8
"worth every penny, really brings out your curiosity and....mental strive for world domination and violence.",60.6
"one of the best games ever, enoough said. (with brave new world)",51.1
"this game wins at expansions. the base game is great as-is, and each expansion adds new mechanics and content that make it feel almost like a brand new game. definitely worth the money.",182.2
"im normally not a big fan of these types of strategy games with my add... but i ended up putting in 100+ hrs on this bad boy! great game for a newcomer to the series. pros: easy to get in to and the learning curve was more forgiving than i thought it might be cons: the diplomacy aspect of the game was non-existent and winning by the new brave new world options was very complicated",74.2
"i suck so bad. seems like it has solid design though. if you like strategy games this is one to think about.",6.6
"complete edition: almost a masterpiece! the only problem i have is boring, strategic ai, that makes me completely feel like im playing by myself. thankfully, the rest of the game is so wonderful that its easily worth the purchase! and surprisingly the new mechanics are so easy to learn, which i was intimidated about before playing. yes there is multiplayer, and yes during the regular waking hours there are people willing to play (if you set your steams region to a big city in the real world), but multiplayer on med-large maps is unplayable as people bail out off the game 90% of the time. what would have kept people to play was an official world-wide tourney ladder & visible scoreboard. a true 8/10 buy with confidence on sale.",96.9
"an amazing game that gets better with each expansion",210.1
"good game. however, im not really much of a fan of the civ series. i still much prefer the eu or tw series. its a blast to play with friends though and the ai is pretty good too.",4.5
"well you all know my satnce on this glorious game 11/10",202.7

"when you think you play this game for 3 hours and then you realize you already waste your time for 3 days",113.8
"buy. this. game. i have over 400 hours invested into this game and it has not gotten boring yet. make sure you get the downloadable content with it. it makes a huge difference and brings all new and exciting ways to play to the table. you have to be careful when playing this game because you will start playing and bam next thing you know you have been playing for 6 hours straight. one of the best games i have ever bought. there is one con to this game. when playing online make sure you try and play with all human players so there are few or no ais playing with you. this is because for some reason the ais wont declare war on anyone while it is in online mode. they will in single player, just not online. honestly that is the only negative thing i have found about this game. word of advice, the zulus are s and mahatma gandhi is an even bigger . 9.5/10",431.4
"so you thought monopoly was the ultimate destroyer of friendships, you have never been more wrong. i can promise you from the bottom of my heart that once someone rushes you with swarms of warriors or destroys you in any fashion during a game of civ 5, you will never be able to look at them the same way again. 10/10 would rush wonders to  everyone off again.",166.7
"verry good and an enjoyable game with a friend or two, either team up or play seperate against eachother , win by economy , religion or culture! you decide your outcome play with your favorite conqueror of the ages like, napoleon , alexander the great , ceasar , queen elizibeth and all the others.",35.5
"definitely worth the purchase, the gold edition expands the game extensively and allows for endless replay",111.7
"your empire is prospering. you just spent your last 100 turns killing the barbarian scum. you have been friendly with the other nations, but that is over now, the arabs have the lowest points, so you attack them thinking that you are oh so clever. as soon as you step on their soil an army the size of your entire population comes over the ocean. you quickly try to make peace, but alas, it is all too late. you go straight into military production, pumping out as many units as you can, but suddenly you see on your screen greece has declared war on you. your friend who spawned halfway across the globe can only watch as you nation is ransacked, tears stream down your eyes, for you have just wasted 14 hours of you life. 10/10 would do it again",54.5
"ghandi will mercilessly roll through your entire civilisation, murdering helpless women and children in an attempt to satisfy his desire for destruction. a man not to be trifled with, may mercy be upon you if you ever become his neighbour.",41.7
"this game is addicting, much better than previous installments. the game is also much better if you have the gods & kings dlc, but without the lc the games combat isnt very realistic and the game itself is fairly dull",306.4
"civ v is a really fun game because it is like alternate history and i like history. if you want to have a way more in depth experience of alternate history then check out one of paradoxs games. but if you want a simpler game, then civ v will be a fantastic game for you. :)",507.0
"great game. very indepth andd quite extensive research trees. by far the best civ yet.",16.8

"i have spent more time on this game than probably any other game ive ever played. if you can get the gods and kings expansion with it, but it stands up on its own well enough to warrant a purchase.",674.5
"due to the fact i havent written any reviews for a long time, i feel it is about time i started again with this unanimously magnificent strategy title! what civilization v constitues is the climax of a renowned series. to begin with ..it looks stunning and its world shines with beautiful and well designed environments. futhermore when you start immersing yourself deeper inside its universe you will begin discovering more of its many virtues. not only has this game one of the most sophisticated in-game mechanisms i have ever seen in a strategy title but also it can maintain your interest for years. trying to offer a detailed insight into civ v could easily make me write pages over pages though i dont want to become tiresome. just keep in mind that this game needs patience in order to unfold all its features. on the whole i have no doubt that especially stategy friends are going to adore it!",70.8
"this is one of the most played games in my steam library, i bought the gold edition and fell in love with it, eventually i bought brave new world, and it became an even better game than ever before. if you have never played this game before, take my word for it, buy this game.",320.1

"im torn, but i am going to go with no, it seems to me they broke apart 1 product into 4 small packages that you need to buy individually in order to have the ful experience, it really seems they did not finish the base civ 5 so dlcs were bought. not worth the individual price of the game and the dlcs, if you find a bundle during the steam sale however, go for it.",167.6
"this game ... too ... addictive ... i ... i have little to say ... but how addictive this game is ... beond earth(huehuehue civilization: beond earth refrence) ... i need to go back to playing civ ... see you in 400 more hours",741.7
"oh civilization v....theres too much to say honestly. if youve played the board game risk before, this is a much more detailed version of that with options other than military domination to lead to victory. if you havent played risk, then this is more like a very complicated version of chess where what you do off the chess board matters too. and if you havent played either of those...this game probably isnt for you. civilization v is a turn-based strategy game at its core, and it is damn good at what it does. however, i do not personally reccommend to purchase this without its dlc bundle, as the main game by itself, doesnt have quite the kick and a lot changes with the dlc additions. i give this game a 9 / 10. definitely worth the pick up if you like strategy or turn-based games.",77.0
"whilst this is simpler than civ 4 (especially with all the beyonf the sword expansion) it is more enjoyable to play and retains the depth",350.6
"with the addition of brave new world, their is an added layer of complexity, but the overall rewarding gameplay is outstanding, ive sunk many a nights into this, both solo and with friends. i have run into some trouble playing over the internet and even local multiplayer, but this is most likely due to my various connections and not the game itself. one feature i would like to see implemented that doesnt exist is for the local multiplayer hot seat mode to also go online and allow multiple players locally as well as across a network.",135.3

"the rule of the not more than one unit for each emplacement is totally silly. the possibility to buy units and buildings make the gameplay strange. the game is really boring, with no interest even in mp. the only interesting aspect and improvement is on the religious matter (but you need the dlc). civ4 is far, far, far better.",79.0

"this is a must have game. thanks to the steam workshop this game allows for a great deal of customisation: wanna roleplay the adventure time kingdoms? go ahead: wanna recreate historical conflicts with civilisations that otherwise arent in the game? step right this way: wanna chance the course of history? civilization v has the power to do all these things and more. endless fun, always discovering new ways to play the game, 400 hours in and only just started taking the religion aspect of the game seriously. still finding new ways for this game to impress me.",621.7

"the game is simply amazing! you cannot play for a few minutes as it will quickly escalate to a few hours. the expansions offer a lot and are more than worth the purchases, but the core game will keep you busy for days. certainly reccommend this game for anyone, even those new to the genre.",804.6

"10/10 great game, small bugs that can be worked around or removed with the expansion packs.",123.9
"easily my favorite strategy game and one of my top games overall. it requires smarts, cunning diplomicy skills, and lots of multitasking. with the complete edition now out, you can buy the game and all the dlc (which makes the game even better) for a very fair price. i can only say good things about this game except for one thing: the combat is fairly lacking. they had a good idea with all of the terrain bonuses and debuffs, but when it comes to pvp, its just hard to be able to attack and move your troops around, because a lot of the time, its whoever clicks first wins. obviously thats not the case all the time and the combat is still pretty ok, but if i had to make any complaint, it would be that. however, all around, this is a fastastic game and easily worth buying the complete edition.",170.4
"great turnbased strategy game, one of the best within its genre. you will sink in a lot of hours into this game, maybe to many. so to speak this game is extremly slow paced. youre litterary playng a board game on the computer. you might end up playing this game a tremendous amount of time without even finishing one single game. but if you can look past that, then by all means grab it during one of steams many sales. i highly reccomend you to buy the gold edition because it fixes so many problems civ v hade within its launch. if you want to improve your game expirence even more then you should grab the brave new world expansion, however after you have played the gods and king or it will be to much to take in. so yeah it is truly an awsome game.",100.3
"this game is one of the most addictive games i have played. first, theres more than one goal to achieve; you can win from multiple standpoints ranging from religion, cultural, military, and science victories. then you can go on to do what you please! its very interesting to have different outcomes each game, as you have to think of different senarios before you do your actions. 9.5/10",62.0
"a nice strategy game, easy to get into and a smooth learning curve. next to ck2 and eu4 my personal favourite, it is just a bit too simple for me, bu the dlcs can make up for it. each dlc expands the game more and more, making it a deeper experience by the hour, the two best features for the dlcs were religions and steam workshop compability, the creators had some nice thoughts about things they didnt liked and either just buffed or nerfed things.",242.0
"as adictive as civ 2 and has better rules and graphics. i still miss the live-action advisors, however, and the advisors in this game are pretty useless. that said, buy it and kiss multiple nights goodbye.",127.2

"love this game, its perfect for times when you just wanna get away from the constant hectic nature that is fps games. i love the fact that you can have the computer tottally betray you. catherine and oda were my best friends on my first playthrough, then they betrayed me and tried to sneak attack me. i then proceded to take out my rage by reducing both of them at the same time to 1 city nations. cathrine then betrayed oda and killed him. i cant trust cathrine now. 10/10",109.0

"a very fun game. i highly recommend it. when i first started the game i was like this is pretty cool. but by the end when i was building giant armies sending out spies and mass building robots of death. i was just blown away. i also got the complete edition for fifteen dollars on 2k publishers weekend. which is easily worth it. even if you buy it at full price i would still recommend it. the only con is it takes a little bit for the game to load up. anyway i recommend trying it.",105.9

"two huge thumbs up, especially for the complete edition. civ v offers limitless playability as well as an incredibly fun and in-depth experience. games will take a long- time and you will love every second. play against your friends over the (quite solid) multiplayer to make the experience even more fun. dominate other cultures, rush whatever technologies you see fit, get nuked by gandhi, nuke your city-state allies... civ gives you the freedom to be as much of an  to the rest of the world as you want. or you could be a nice guy and win a diplomatic victory (borrrring). i suggest trying to buy the game while it is on sale (summer sale is a great option, but its been on sale twice in the past year) as it is a little pricey. if you have to pay the full $50 for the complete edition, however, it is still worth it. really amazing game, 10/10.",257.8
"great game for anyone with enough time to sit and play for 4-5 hours straight",81.8
"an interesting read for children of all ages, sid meiers fantastic four v is a twist on the fps genre with its inclusion of a fully interactional book store. i gotta say though, i thought the lack of avengers in this game was disappointing. i still have hope for a crossover event come the next game, though. choice/10",123.8
"my favorite game to just relax with. even at higher difficulties i never really stress out with civ i just sit back and try to execute my strategies to the best of my ability and hope i dont spawn in a desert. dlc is well worth it since it adds so many new layers to an already complex game. multiplayer is a blast as well. always a good time to beat a friend to a wonder and listen to them rage over skype.",146.0

"a very fun and addicting game, anything can happened and it keeps you from getting bored.",299.7
"this is definately the absolute greatest turn-based strategy game ever. i have been a fan since i first played civ iv and i could not wait for civ v, and i have to say that i was not dissapointed at all. the level of realism in the decision making aspects of the game is incredible and the graphics are phenomenol. if you are a fan of any genre of strategy game, i definately reccomend you getting this.",157.7

"civilization is one of the few games that is really worth its price. you can keep playing it fo as long as you want and every time it will present you with chalenges and meaninful decisions. not that 8 hours disposable crap you are used to. buy it now.",109.1
"sneak attack nuke from gandhi? declared a war mongering menace to the world by atilla? fun stuff right there. i didnt enjoy the game play changes from civ 4 to this game at first. but as the hours have burned by ive discovered that this game is very intuitive and enjoyable at every difficulty level and era speed. i highly recommend.",703.6
"this series is still the only one that makes me absolutely loose track of time. if you like 4x games at all this is a more than worthy addition to the civ series.",55.9
"r8 goot gam. it can be plenty fun, even for people who arent vets of the series (me) and who arent turn based strategy buffs (me). it feeds you gameplay elements and things to think about as you go on, so every new game doesnt bog you down with a million things to manage. the game is visually appealing as well and the soundtrack is often quite nice to listen to i rekomend",190.1
"this game is fun, and the modding community is awesome, but only if you have brave new world and gods and kings, if not, then you are not going to mod anytime soon.",10.0
"a wonderful game. very detailed. have played it regularly for for a couple of years.",176.4
"this game is an excellent upgrade from civilization iv. they removed the superstacks of soldiers and limited it to one type of unit per tile and that is a major improvement. the base civilizations are varied and some are from more hidden parts of history, which is a nice change of pace. the new tile design of hexagons is also a nice change, helping with a strategy change. however, one of my gripes are the achievements. you get them by just playing the game. eliminate another civ, upgrade a unit, find ruins, etc... even though they have no gameplay impact it is offputting to see supposed achievements in the grand scheme of human achievement those may be, but in this sort of game setting they are not applicable. overall, a great upgrade from civ iv that gets rid of the unnessecary while keeping the fundamentals intact.",82.6
"if you like turn based strategy, prepare to lose hours upon hours of your time.",71.1
"sid meiers civilization v is one of the best games i have ever played, but i would recommend getting the brave new world expansion as it enhances the gameplay greatly. i have literally spent hours playing with my friends, losing every time, but the experience of the game in itself is what makes this game truly remarkable. a masterpiece.",163.5
"ive lost many hours of sleep to this game. very fun.",63.2
"i really like this game. i really enjoy what its about. but i cant say that it should be picked up. i played one day for 12 hours straight casue was great. but then reality comes in and you feel a repitition , there isnt any real faction trait thatll make you want to try another, you can easily get every upgrade, every fight is easy and the waiting to finish game wanders off and you wont stay to finish. there are many maps and mods for factions but its all the same. you will play this game a lot and never put it away. but the fun factor will disappear real quick. least you get it with your friends, it might be worth it. or get it on a steam sale.",40.1

"sid meirs civilization v is a easy get to know if your a starter at strategy games. the dlcs add mroe complex things which allows the starter to enchance their experience and become a intermedient. civ v is basically a building block from where you can decide which strategy games you choose in the future that offer more challenging experiences. overall civ is a great game and is highly reccommend if your just getting insterested in stategy. if your a right on pro at strategy games get civ still because why not? greece pwns 10/10",665.7
"if you enjoy any turn based strategy games then look no further! for those who played past civ games, you may be dissapointed by some of the new features. civ 5 does a good job introducing new players so the seies, which could be a neggetive affect on civ veterans. all in all, great game.",60.6
"its one of the only games that i can keep coming back to and enjoy.",237.6
"i wanted to have a good amount of hours in this game before i recommed it or not, guses 200 hours have to do ;). i would like to start to say that the game is great. you can have fun for hours on end even if you just chose one civ to play as. the replayabilty is high with different maps and others civ to play againest.the games do take a long time but once you start you will lose track of time, one miutue it would be 3 pm and 135 turns later its 6 or 7pm. overall a great game, cant wait for beyond earth to get here.",271.2

"civ5 isnt nearly as indepth as civ4 and the three expansions, but its really a good thing. late game is a lot more balanced, and the dlc adds some nice scenarios without breaking the bank. all the customization is there, and the hex system makes a nice change of pace.",47.1

"for fans of the classic turn based strategy look no further than sid meiers civilization v. ive sunk 200+ hours into it and still havent explored everything that the game has to offer. no two games are alike. explore the world and maybe become the dominant civilization of the world. a nice and quick game can be short like 300 turns, while the marathon sessions can be 1300 turns if you let the game advance to the 2000 ce. if you are a returning player from previous installments or even a brand new person to the series purchase this game and its expansions to continually add more content as new updates come out all the time.",338.2
"this is one of best turn based strategy games out there right now. i strongly recommend this game if you have a attitude for critical thinking games, along with a liking to playing a large array of renowned historical leaders. buy it and give it a try!",118.5

"hours of possible playtime, and many facits to enjoy",343.8
"all civs have been fun to play, but this one steps it up. there is always so much to do and manage when playing this game. micro your individual cities while having to macro your entire civilization is a fun challenge. with so many different ways to win other then build a lot of military and attack, many types of people would be attracted to try this game. multiplayer with friends is also a great way to lose an afternoon.",322.7

"this game is absolutely amazing. egypt and i(mongolian empire) have made it into the 20th century. didnt see that one coming now did you history?",60.2
"very slow starting game, but thats what makes it great. chosing what your civ researchers first can help or hurt in the long run. its a new game everygame and games do take a long time to complete depending on the settings you chose. very fun does have mods for it. 8/10",57.3

"i love this game and all others like it thank you.",22.7
"complete edition: almost a masterpiece! the only problem i have is boring, strategic ai, that makes me completely feel like im playing by myself. thankfully, the rest of the game is so wonderful that its easily worth the purchase! and surprisingly the new mechanics are so easy to learn, which i was intimidated about before playing. yes there is multiplayer, and yes during the regular waking hours there are people willing to play (if you set your steams region to a big city in the real world), but multiplayer on med-large maps is unplayable as people bail out off the game 90% of the time. what would have kept people to play was an official world-wide tourney ladder & visible scoreboard. a true 8/10 buy with confidence on sale.",96.9

"civilization v is one of the best strategic games i have played in a long time. while the ai can be a bit ridiculous (putting this very lightly) at times, the game itself is well crafted. the interface is clear, but not overly simplistic; and the tutorials, mixed into game itself, allow new players to quickly jump into the game. whether youre a veteran to strategic games, or someone just starting out, civilization v is the perfect addition to your steam library.",84.0

"this game is great!! i love it! just everything about this game makes it fun. plus you can nuke people!!!!",21.3
"this is a great game for those who are newcomers to strategy games and those who are either familiar to civilization or strategy games in general. its simple and easy to understand but good enough as both an introduction and continuation to playing strategy games. i highly recommend it on its own but even more so if you buy the brave new world expansion.",542.5

"if someone asked me what game i would reccomend to introduce them to pc gaming, i would immediatly reccomend this. this has been one of the more involving and rewarding games i have ever played, and would reccomend it to anyone. i will go ahead and say that if you have never played a similar game to this before, there is a pretty steep learning curve that will at first be overwhelming, but power through and you will understand why this game recieves such high praises.",50.8
"good strategy game but it keeps crashing randomly on windows 8 please fix",54.6

"this fifth installment really brings my previous civ gaming experiences to the next level. :) as a history and a book lover, civilization 5 brings me to the days of old when nations are still small, wars are constant, where seeds technological development are still being planted and watered for growth, wonders are being constructed, etc. this game gives users the best perspective of seeing how the nations of the world evolve and continues to evolve until now. nice gameplay, superb detail and graphics, plus the accuracy of ai leader personalities (based on history) really gives you that great feeling leading your chosen civilization to glory. the different systems in the game, the religion and espionage (in gods and kings) adds depth to gameplay. it gives the player multiple ways to achieve victory for a civ. i just love this game so much.",527.8
"an incredibly robust game with a lot of depth and fun. although it can get a bit samey through multiple plays there enough settings and styles to keep it interesting. worth a play for those looking for some long turn-based strategy.",49.3
"really enjoy this game and if it could add a battle feature like total wars then i would say its perfect.",259.2
"civ 5 is an overall improvment to the formula. hexes and unstackable units improve the strategy. exploring culture and economy are great. i wish i had more time to play this!",330.2
"this is by far one of my most favorite games ive ever played. every single game is vastly different with so many variables to account for that it makes it a very complex and stimulating game to play. with that being said it is also relatively easy to learn with the varied difficulty levels accomodating all levels of players. being able to see and learn about various things in world history while shaping your own version of it makes this game that much better. i cant wait to see what they do for civ 6.",741.4
"this is a really nice game,but,dont download it even you buy it,it got bug inside.you cant even play it,either endless loading or problem in playing...... but i still recommend you guys to buy this game.you can download it after a new patch,this review is post on 11-6-14,wait until the next patch will be a nice option",65.8
"warning! please read! this game will suck the life out of you. the concept called taking a break will not work for this game. see how many hours i have on it? those are straight hours without any breaks. all night, no rest, just food. be warned. this game is amazing, and highly fun, and extremely addictive. you cant just play this game for a bit. you cant even just play this game for a while. you can only play it till your spirit is worn out, when your eyes are bloodshot, and when every single part of your  is cramped up. and only then, after you have met the criteria, can you take a break. this game is my jam. but i dont dare play it again, scared that i might die from complete exhaustion. score: 9 1/2 dead sleepless bodies out of 10 dead sleepless bodies. i like pangaea.",13.6
"spent an hour just on tutorials because it was so addicting.",22.5
"civilization v is perfect installment for civilization franchise, good gameplay; a.i. little too agressive, but when you get used to it, youll start to like this game. bad sides of this game is, that when you buy civilization v, then buy gold edition, because youll save money and get so many expansions.",33.6
"is a great game for new/casual strategy game players, and is also a great game for hardcore serious strategy players, there is always things to do in your empire, but it never overwhelms you. so yeah, its good =)",121.6
"i love the civ games and have been playing them since civ 2. the only thing i think the games have lost is the espionage element. i miss having my spies in civ 2 that i could move about the board and create strife in neighboring cities then take them over. i know a lot of people disliked that about the spies and i have found that most people either love or hated the spies no in between. either way this is still a good addition to the civ world. looking forward to the next installment. oh... and bring back spy units!",8.7

"great game for anyone who likes strategy. pretty addicting too. overall, great game.",357.5
"with both expansions installed, civ 5 finally becomes as complex as previous installments (they add religion, world congress, etc). ai still kind of sucks at combat, but otherwise its a great game that you can sink many hours into.",1063.9
"this game is amazing and is a great strategy game :d, cant wait for civilization vi :d",65.4
"this may be the single greatest game ever, from its awesomeness, to its epicness, it makes you suck a  and like it.",131.2
"bland at best, the combat system is still a joke, diplomacy is laughable, the ai is not able to compromise or reason. the upgrade system for units is annoying, you also cant view how your city really looks like anymore. the computer players also get massive fake resources to compensate for a lack of development and thought. meaning all cities you conquer will generally be trash, beat the game once then never play it again or just save your money and time.",45.4
"ghandi is an  10/10 game of the year premium elite edition",55.3

"great turn-based strategy game, although its boring without the the expansions gods and kings & brave new world. the workshop offers great scenarios like r.e.d ww2 mod and fun mods like the pc gaming master race. it also provides you with many gameplay fixes and improvements. this game surely has its flaws, but i had a lot of fun playing it (even though i didnt play any strategy-games before) and i can recommend this game to anyone willing to spend some money on it.",155.0

"having started my civ experience with sid meiers alpha centauri back in the early 2000s, i can say that coming to this game after playing that shows a huge improvement in many features, but a loss in many others. one thing i seriously hope for in beyond earth is a return for the unit customization. please.",123.6

"i cant explain it. you open the game...and then you look at the clock and youve somehow lost track of the last 6 hours. any game that can engross you that much is a definite recommendation! a definite must-have for any 4x strategy game fan!!",13.7

"while many of the dlcs should have been included from the start, or given away for free, the overall experience is awing. the game draws you in and steals hours & days of your life. and while the game itself is worth the play, it is the modding community that really offers the replayability. some mods (such as faerun) completely transform the game, while others add new content (civilizations, maps, scenarios, tools) within the confines of the current layout. having sunk so many hours into the game, i still find myself going back for more.",178.9
"awesome game for co-op or multiplayer, in depth and detailed.",109.5
"this game takes a verey long time, and unless you have friends in real lifee willing to play with you, cant be playeed miltiplayer! i recommend it to anyone in stratigy/economic games! its my favorite game on steeam by far, however the time it consumes is annoying at times. be warned a two hour game is short, most are about 5 to 6!",382.5
"the more you play this game the better gets. you cant just sit down and play this for a few minutes you needs hours and hours to even make dent in the amoutn of gameplay needed to really get things going. all in all 10/10 strategy game, would play again...and again...and again....",85.3
"im not gonna lie, games like this i dont really enjoy. but this is something else. it can look quite confusing to begin with however from the guidence of a few friends i was running my own empire, founding new cities and creating a religion. under my control japan was ruling the world. and i was loving it to say the least. the multiplayer works slightly differently but with a few friends its still great fun! overall and amazing game. and i cant really complain when i got the full game plus all the dlc for only 8.99!",44.2
"one of the greatest turn based strategy games which is only made better by the dlc. i highly recommend the game and any dlc that peaks your interest at the very least buy the expansions if you really wanna up the gameplay features.",89.1
"civilization v is honestly one of my favorite stratigy games. it can be fun in single player but when you have friends to play with it gets even more fun. for anyone who likes a got stratigy game then this is a game you should have. there are quite a few difficulty levels you can choose from to make your game more challenging. you have to keep up with so many asspects at once that it can feel a bit overwellming your first few games, but you will get used to it. with the brave new world and gods and kings dlcs it can add a whole lot to the game and almost make you feel like your having to change your play style completly. overall i would recommend buying this game.",156.5

"this game is a lot of fun, even if you just play it by yourself. the ai can be a bit derpy, but i think that can be overlooked. there are just so many different things to do in civ, especially with the scenarios and all the different types of civilizations. randomized maps and the ability to exploit the environment and strategies with technology (say, rushing education for science) make each playthrough unique.",180.2

"i am not a great lover of turn based games, you heard me not! you have heard brilliant reviews on this game from the turn based veterans of the gaming world. but you sir are not them! you are looking at this game that came out years ago and are wondering maybe i should give it a shot, to see what all the fuss is about. well take my review as this, this game is pure cocaine, it is so addictive it should be labelled as a drug by the fda. like a said before i am not a fan of turn base games, but this game turned me, it is worth the price and i will play for many more hours, and if you get bored 40 hours in. (if thats possible) add a mod or two to change the game up completely. it will never end for me. i have found the game that will more than likely die with. just... one... more... turn...",77.0
"fantastic game, much like age of empires or rise of nations, but more complex and more victory types!",733.0
"with the brave new world add on civ5 is highly recommended. depending on the difficulty and other settings you are busy days per session. for me personally a great game. one reason for me to play a game on the pc again. warning! extremely addictive!",179.9

"i have been playing civilization since day 1 (1991) and now in the year 2014 i cant wait for byond earth add on",927.3
"if you love turn based strategy this is a must own game. the only issue is the game software does not efficiently use the hardware of your system so you need some powerful hardware to play this game on top settings on the largest maps, especially during the late game the lag can become nearly unbearable.",896.5
"i was going into this with high expectations and came back with little to no complaints at all. the game creates a lot of improvements being already dominant in the grand strategy genre and is absolutely nerve-breaking. i highly recommend this game to strategists in particular. pros: - challenging - smooth management features - tactical warfare - create your own empire..",19.1
"i like role playing as the glorious female leader of carthage.",172.7
"this is my favorite civilization yet. its beautiful, fluid, and still retains the just one more turn addictiveness the series is known for. the music is outstanding as well, with themes written for each country that shift and change as you progress through the game. the new tactical warfare really makes a difference too; gone are the stacks of doom from previous games. its a meat and potatoes tactical addition that really sets this iteration apart from previous games imo. its a must-own for fans of the series or turn-based strategy in general.",307.4
"i recommend this game alot. if you play it multiplayer it might be a bit laggy, but it still works. its a really good game where you can challenge the ai in a stragetic game with no possible way of nothing how theyll react.",118.9
"a truly awesome and addictive game. once you pick it up, you cannot put it down and you cannot stop thinking about it when you take a little break from it. one sunday morning i decided to play it. once i finished up, i realised my day was gone. the game is somewhat slow, but i hear its dlc brave new world speeds it up a bit. i find no cons in this game. 10/10",259.3
"warning: game is super addicting, buy at your own risk! one of the best, if not the best, strategy games ive ever played. rock solid mechanics, fantastic replayability, you can play pretty much however you want, you can customize almost every part of the game, like how it can end, how many resources are available, ect. one flaw with this game is the horrendous ai. like, its really bad. i find myself getting frustrated at how stupid the ai is every game. making a fair trade is nearly impossible, you get threatened and denounced for what seems like no reason and at complete random, even your so-called allies will randomly turn on you for no reason. still worth the price of admission, even if the ai is awful.",46.3
"best game of the series yet! make sure to get the main expansions, makes it a lot better",107.4
"i highly recommend this game if you really like to kill time, literally. just so you know, this is a real time strategy, similar with age of empires, but this one is in turn-based system which i think have made this game much interesting to play. and the ai is hard enough to beat if you didnt set up your strategy well. the best thing that makes this game one of my favorites is civilization v is not all about war, war and war. you can try nuke, nuke and nuke for fun. (note: this is a game which could kill your real life.)",64.3

"one of the best strategy games out there, must buy! rating: 9.2/10",156.4
"when it comes to turn-based over real-time, civ is king. gloriously complex, different every time, and a game that praises thinking and strategy over brute force and dumb luck. that doesnt mean you cant zerg, turtle or rush, it just means you can play your way. it does suffer from some horrible graphical bugs, which i would have hoped they would have fixed by now - but this just makes it look ugly at times, its still a fantastic game.",16.0
"the kind of game you can easily get lost in for hours. not a game you can start up lightly, but with interesting strategic decision, and many paths to victory, this game never gets old. even with over 300 hours in game i feel i have not given the game anywhere near the time it requires to fully exlore.",304.5
"not the greatest civ game i have played. not being able to stack units and the hexa-tiles sure makes things different from the previous games. you have to love civ to look past the flaws to enjoy all the beauty that is this game.",76.5

"dont let the title fool you. this is actually not trusting gandhi simulator 10/10 would get rekt by gandhi again.",29.1
"there is a reason why civilization has defined the strategy game genre for over two decades. its not just because, like chess, its simple to learn and complex to master. its not that it brings out your inner ruler/warlord/diplomat like no other game. its because, in addition to all this, ruling an empire in civ is more fun than sitting naked in a roller-coaster and more addictive than heroin-induced coffee. in other words, playing civ is an experience. with civilization v, the series updates many stagnated issues (ref: unit stacking) and takes a leap into new areas (ref: social edicts). highly recommended, even for those who thought civ 4 was the high-point.",30.1
"i cant even describe how amazing this game is!!! if you like history, alt. history or just having power, this is the game for you!",854.1
"civ v is relatively easy to get into, yet there is almost no end to what you can do in it. to be honest, i bought this game right when it came out because i somehow had it confused with simcity. i would definitely recommend this game.",643.1
"finally up to snuff after the brave new world dlc. worth another look if you havent played since the original launch.",107.6
"i really enjoyed this game until i started playing on a higher difficulty, only to discover the ais actually dont get any better, they dont make better decisions, their not more efficent, they just receive massive amounts of advantages that get them ahead for no good reason. this game could of been a lot better if they had just made the ais smarter, not give them free hard outs. i also have a bone to pick with the multiplayer in civ 5, there are a lot of issues revovling lag, sometimes it goes to the loading screen for no reason and the ais are . even with all this negative stuff, i still enjoy the game, id just wish they patch/update more often.",304.0
"great game, i reccomend having patience if you are going to buy this game, a beautiful strategy game of what-if. for example, what if the great wall of china was made by america? (the great wall of america) well, thats possible! watch yourself holding history in your hands and bending it to your will! 10/10 great game! :d",228.7
"gets a bad rep, though not always unwarranted. that said, the latest expansion makes it significantly more playable, and i cant go back to stacks of doom.",84.3
"an enjoyable game that gave me many late nights. its a game that you can always comeback and play again and again, esp with the modding community. 10/10, do yourself a favor and buy it.",125.3
"first off the bat, this game is amazing. its a strategy where you build you empire as one of the worlds greatest leaders. its highly addicting and worth the purchase for anyone thats a fan of the genre!",116.2
"long time civ fan, since the first game, all the way to new via colonization, alpha centauri, etc. civ iv with rise of mankind mod is still far superior. sadly, even with the expansions this is a much thinner experience, feels watered down. multiplayer is ok but doesnt make up for the lack of depth.",135.7
"it took me a while to get used to the whole turn based thing, but now i realize that its addicting as hell and therefore great for the developers, so thumbs up for that. unlike other strategy games ive tried its not that much to organize and gather, which makes it easier to focus on the strategy/occupying land/backstabbing/building armies part  and i guess that deserves a thumbs up as well. and as others already pointed out: beware of gandhi.",32.4
"okay so where do i start? first week 25 hours in ok. i have owned this for about 7 months and have aprox, 140 hours. interduced me to the 4x games. easy to get into. i recomend getting brave new world too for the religion. also ghandi for lol has more nuke tendacies then nepolean?",219.2

"this is a great game. its pretty hard to learn, but once you do its really fun.",19.0
"so this game needs to be reviewed as it is one of the greatested experiences ive ever had in gaming. this game is smooth and true to the franchise in every way. the dlcs add and change so much they almost feel like a whole new game. civ 5 brings to the table a fantastic turnbased experience that i can sit down and play for hours. trial and error, new straegies, different paths you can take will completely changed how the game will turn out. smart ai adds to the games sense of running a real country in a real world. the single player on its own makes this game great but like many other games nothing beats playing it with a friend. if you have the money i reomend picking this game up with all its dlc its well worth a look.",198.2
"great game, this is one my my favorate stragety games of all time. if you are a fan of turn based games then i would definetly reccomend it.",138.4
"there is not enough words to describe how amazingly fun this game is and i have yet to meet someone who doesnt enjoy playing the game :) there are a variety of courses you can choose to go whether you choose to destroy everyone in your path or possibly be a diplomatic leader who strives in culture. the game is extremely fun when you play with your friends and like monopoly it seems to take forever to actually finish. you dont have to play with friends, but it certainly can bring a new edge to the game unlike playing against npcs. in conclusion, if you are looking for a long lasting enjoyable game that you can play by yourself or with friends, then look no further ^_^",64.8
"great single player game with both the expansions, stable mulitplayer for 2-6 people. i give it 2 pumpkins out of 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971",390.1
"ever imagined yourself as king or president? well, heres your chance! sid meier brings you civilization 5, a beautiful 4x strategy game where you take the role of a leader of a people. throughout the game you will experience change, advancement, and trouble, or riches. you can also play the game in many different ways, depending on how you want to win. honestly, this game easily makes my top three games of all time, and i wish i could explain better, but this game has so much to offer its incredible. this game has so many features and possiblities its breath taking, and if you dont think this is enough to intrigue you, i personally suggest you go watch the yogscast or someone else play it. oh, btw, never. ever. trust gandhi.",152.8
"what can i say about civ 5? it is the greatest strategy game ever made thus far, and i doubt that will change until civ 6. sid meir is single handedly dragging the stratagy genre through a time when strategy games are about as popular g.w bush. there is no reason to have steam and not own this game. it is the greatest concept ever conseived by a games designer. now put down your tools workers and worship at the feet of or lord, sid meir. 10/10",46.9
"one last turn! fans of the civlization franchise have been screaming since the series inception and civ v is no exception. with many mechanics being overhauled and refined, every bit of the game is even better than the predecessor. fan or not you must check out this game, for it will consume your life (in the best way possible of course).",24.6
"this is by far one of the best games i have ever played. do you enjoy taking over the world with: - force - science - religion - tourism - culture - diplomacy yeah...this is definitly the game. you can play it over and over again wining the game in many different ways and playing as so many different civilizations. the online multiplayer is excellent, although at times can be a little glitchy. i highly recommend the expansions. i have only played with gods and kings, but plan on getting brave new world as well.",45.2
"great game if your into strategy not as great as civ 4 but still great game",554.0
"an excellent game that will leave you thoroughly addicted. the amount of times ive said to myself just one more turn is too high to count. if you are a fan of 4x strategy games, civ 5 is a must buy.",635.1
"this game is highly addictive and just plain fantastic (especially with the dlc). just...one...more...turn!",160.1
"after hundreds of hours of gameplay this is still my go-to game when im looking for something to do. cant recommend this game enough!",455.9
"a great addition to the empire-building strategy game. you have the ability to raise an empire from nothing and set about on your quest to rule the planet. through means of diplomacy, technological advancements, culture or war you can make the earth move under your command. choose one of 43 empires from throughout history to aid you in victory, with several other mechanics such as religion, happiness, espionage and great people this game is first choice if you need an in-depth strategy.",389.8

"the game has awesome gameplay, but it recently started crashing all the time after running perfectly any advice?",5.1
"this is probably the best strategy based game i have ever played , i have played civilization since civ 2 , and i can personaly tell you that this game is incredible . it requires skill , while still being a game for casual/ easy going players. the dlc are fantastic and are among the greatest i have ever played . over all it is a well crafted master piece that is a must buy for any gamer looking for a game to test his skills of leadership. over all 10/10 .",363.6
"i thoroughly recommend sid meiers civilization v, as it provides literally hundreds of hours of captivating entertainment at the expense of a mere 40 earth dollars. you can have endless fun attacking your (not really) best friends with nuclear weapons of mass destruction, destroying all of their tiresome efforts in one fell swoop. i dont recommend doing that last part too much, as, judging from personal experience, it can tend to provoke suicidal thoughts in the victims mind. other than that, its pretty  and overpriced.",213.2
"great game. absorbs you into it with the addicting strategy gameplay. definitely a must buy.",98.0
"with all the expansions, gods & kings and brave new world, this is the best game of the franchise! 10/10",334.3

"this game taught me what it is to be a huge ucker. before i had this gem of a gem of a gem, i didnt know what it was to be yoko ono. thanks to sid fliers oregon trail viii, i can die a happy man. my only quip would be the inventory system, which is unable to be used because there is not one in the game. it took me about five and a half hours to figure out that civ 5 was not an on-rails shooter.",78.6

"great civ game. would like to see the build your castle come back like in civ 2. still feel that civ games need to improve the diplomacy options. otherwise, a great game.",361.0
"too bad im not completely fluent in any other languages yet, because english certainly doesnt have the words to describe how epic this game is. im currently playing my bazillionth game, and ive played nearly 750 hours, but every game still feels like a brand new experience. the ui is probably the most user-friendly in any game ever, and the music is just plain awesome, plus every game is randomly generated. theres a demo; download it and youll see what i mean. so when you do get hooked, and you do dish out 80 bucks for the gold edition plus brave new world (as you should!), dont get upset when you start failing your classes or missing work because you played all night and didnt even notice, because trust me, your time is better spent here.",1060.1
"great social strategy game. the engine creates a pretty easy-going sort of playstyle. artwork is decent, and so is variety. the diplomacy in the game does not have much depth to it, and creating a lasting alliance with another faction is a rarity. there is also the problem with turn processing, at later turns (150+), you may aswell tab out of the game, as you might be waiting over 5 minutes for the game to end the turn and start a new one. still very enjoyable, 8/10.",123.2
"this is one of the better simulator games out there, accurately representing the hundreds of years it takes to build a dirt road ten kilometres long",49.1
"this game is greatly time consuming which would be the only real flaw to the game if you were to ask me. overall the gameplay is smooth and is fun, really wish you could make the game a bit more fast pace and the fact there was no single player story line was kind of dissapointing. great time waster if you need that, is really fun in multiplayer and single player. great variety of playable historic people.",24.5

"definitely a game that will keep you playing for hours on end if youre into strategy. the mass number of civilizations to choose from and the multiple ways to win give it a real depth to keep gameplay going.",115.1
"easily the best turn based strategy out there. quite different from its predecessors but thats not a bad thing as the older games still stand up well today so this just provides a solidly different game that is great on its own merits. top notch!",31.8
"the gold standard of city building rts. this game is visually beautiful and everytime i play it i discover a new strategy to give myself and edge. combined with multiple ways to win it gives you endless replayability.",205.3

"you will not regret buying this game. i highly suggest it. please buy.",69.5
"honestly one of the best games i have ever played. the replayability is unreal. i own the complete version and the dlc just adds so much depth to the game. the only problem i have is how hard mods are to install. pros gameplay ui replayability depth graphics mods (though limited they are there) cons sometimes wish there were more diplomacy options wish i had more control over my citizens sometimes",44.7
"civ v, after all the patches and expansions, has matured into an enjoyable grand strategy game, even if, overall, its argueably a step back for the franchise. the game is gorgeous. diplomacy and trade work are more nuanced than ever. fewer cities and units means less micromanagement and city states create interesting new gameplay. the reduced complexity of most of its systems is apparent after awhile though, at least to me. each civ is really only suited to one or two victory conditions. civ iv allowed you to dynamically change your governmental structure depending on the situation, where civ v just has you accumulate points towards the next permanant perk, without any apparent change afterwards. its still fun to play through many many times and is by no means a bad game, its just not as complex or open ended as its predecessors, and so slightly less replayable than they were, imho.",251.6
"my butt plug really enjoys this games, it makes fredrick (the butt plug) really happy.",208.2
"this game is an incredably addictive game, as wowcrendor once said: civilization is one of those games that you play for ten hours and then when you look at the clock you go: i was playing that for ten hours? if you want a good time waster and a fantastic turn based 4x stratagy game, this is the game for you. although, i advise you buy brave new world as well, it makes the game ten times better. i would do a more lenghy review but im azkamooski.",121.2

"what can i say about this game? if youve ever played previous iterations of this game (i started with civilization ii), then youre probably already addicted and own it. for newcomers, i think firaxis have done an amazing job simplifying the ui and providing useful prompts for new mechanics as they appear, so this is a great version to start with. even with the simplifications, all the depth youd expect from this game is still there and you can expose it easily (the city management screen for example). with the gods & kings and brave new world dlc, firaxis have made what i think is by far the most entertaining civilization yet! so, to summarise: buy this game if you have any love for strategy and a w streak. just be prepared to lose entire days to it.",496.8
"one of the single most addictive games i think ive ever played. each single campaign takes hours to get through, even on the fast setting! tense multiplayer,countless approaches to winning and this only gets better with each dlc added to the game. cannot wait for the new civ announced at e3! short summary: epic.",77.1
"this game is an amazing strategy game. its not fantasy or anything like that. what i love about this game is how realistic it is. you really have to think what your stratgey will be against other players and npcs. the only bad part is the time you have to spend on this game. if you are willing to spend a lot of time on playing game or games, then you will enjoy this game for sure.",106.1

"this is my first civilization game. it took me a couple hours to really get the hang of it, but now i am completely addicted. i like that you can win several different ways. this is a nice change from having to kill everyone else on a map. i also like that ability to adjust the game speed so i can play a game in a few hours or few days. i highly recommend this if you like turn based strategy.",1021.8
"i loved this game you can control how the world is shaped you can make your own history what you do in 500 b.c. could change things in 500 a.d. i recommend this game",426.4

"this game is a huge time-sink, and for all the right reasons! each game you play, wether multiplayer or against the excellently done a.i will provide hours upon hours of strategic challenges and an excellent system of micromanagement. with the several different victory conditions and tons of different civilizations to play (each with their own unique bonuses, units and buildings) this game caters for every possible strategy. definitely a recommended game - civ 5 is a great play for veterans of the series and for newcomers.",277.1

"this has to be the greatest investment ive made on steam in the two years ive been using it. civilization v is an amazing turn-based strategy game and although im not a seasoned fan of the franchise as ive only been playing this for a year, it deserves the hundreds of reccomendations it has and im sure that even with beyond earth being released civ v will continue to be competitive throughout steam. i have to say this is... there is no word good enough to describe this game.",542.8

"do you like civilizations?! do you like warfare?! do you like firing nukes without repercussions?! if you answered yes to any of the above, read on. if not... read on anyway. i might be able to persuade you. civilization v is nothing like the previous incarnations of the series. except for the overall gameplay, most of the features have changed. leaders have been done away with, and all nations have only one leader. religion has been greatly expanded upon with the gods & kings expansion, and theres a new world congress feature to replace the un in brave new world. that being said, while this is a great game by itself, the unpatched version without the dlc and expansionpacks is inferior to civilization iv in terms of content. if youre planning to pick this up, get it with the dlc or at the very least the expansions. it should give you, at the veyr least, a few hours of amusement.",126.7

"this game is really fun to play by yourself but even more fun to play with others. even the short gamemodes are really long though so its almost impossible to sit down from start to finish of a game. when playing in multiplayer its a good idea to team up as the ais seem more agressive especially gandhi, dont trust him.",86.5
"this game is great! it is very easy to waste away ten hours on accident playing this game, and getting a group of friends and talking on skype while you play makes it even better. highly reccomend.",248.9

"there are few grand strategy/casual play games that pull it off as well as the civ series. civ 5 is one of my favourites. easy to get to grips with, a great game to chill out with and play with friends and there is always that sense of grim satisfaction when you nuke a nation into non-existance, while they are still in the bronze age.",118.7
"playing this game for about three months or so, i figured out the possiblities of discovering new worlds, fighting civilizations, and using extraordinary mods to play the game appeal to me. however, i find the game very time consuming, as one would have to move their units one by one and especially the processing time is long. overall, i find this game interesting, creative, and enjoyable. 4/5",233.3

"this was the first civilization game i ever played, also one of my first pc games as well. being a first timer to the game, and the 4x genre itself, i was pleasantly surprised by the expansive tutorial and how easy the game is to get into. easy to learn, difficult to master, as they say. the base game is quite good, but i would really recommend the complete edition, brave new world being my favorite of the dlcs, refining the cultural victory type into an addictive way to dominate your enemies, not to mention the new world congress where words and legislation are just as sharp and damning as swords and military might. this was my first pc game to break 100 hours, shocking me at how soon and easily this feat was achieved. it is an endlessly playable game with layer upon layer of content. i heartily recommend this to anyone, even if new to the genre.",158.0

"civ5 is an epic and complex analytic game. whatsoever, i can recommend it to everybody who likes turn-based strategy and folks who like to use their brain. when youre playing call-of- and else, dont buy civ5, i really believe your neurological structure mass will be damaged when you try to find out how the game mechanics of this dainty videogame would work. hm, yes, im really certain you would die. exruciating and without blessedness and love. doesnt matter, the game is easier than civ iv and it has its own stupidity (click the right thing, next round, click the right thing, next round - oh a nuclear bomb! - click the right thing, next round) but its in principle good mastered so that it isnt in evidence. enjoy - or buy civ iv, both are good, the older is better but the recent is more modern.",34.2

"been playing civ for years now... never managed to get tired ! :)",18.6

"adictive game. if you like games like: command & conquer you proberbly like this one to if not better. i reccomand to get at least 1 of the dlc like: (gods & kings :))",56.1
"fantastic game, definitely recommend it. it has good gameplay, good graphics, good music, the only problem i have is an occasional graphics and audio bug when i play the game too long. but, its not a major disfunction, and the pros far outweigh the cons. worth every cent!",112.7
"play this far too much! love it, always have. plenty of detail, gameplay. graphics as you would expect. the whole game is nicely polished but what i love the most is the amount of mods and stuff available in the workshop, pretty much change the whole game. 9/10 (looking forward to the next installment)",383.0
"very good if you like stradegy remember the french wil try to kill you",484.5
"simply brilliant! i think its much improved on civ iv, though many seem to disagree with me. improved a lot with the addition of brave new world - gods and kings was less impressive.",560.6
"this game is pretty addicting. at first, i was skeptical because i usually dont play these types of games, but when you get into it, you just have to keep going.",239.4
"game sucks.. if you come even close to being a viable civilization, the game will give you  maps and no resources.. typical sid meyers game. i played 2 and loved it, played 3 and burned it in fireplace. skipped 4 and should have skipped 5. oh, i should add i have played games since my first one, the bards tale on my old ibm with no ram, only 2 7 flopies. lot of games have gone by the board since then and i played a lot of hours on useless ones and fun ones. other than master of orion 2 and civ 2, the sid meyer games have been by far the worst games i have ever played.",405.3

"this was my first civ game so i cant compare it to past games, but ive thoroughly enjoyed this game since it first came out. each expansion has added a ton to the game. the first gods & kings expansion gave civ v a lot of depth and introduced a lot of new elements, i wouldnt buy any less than the gold edition for a new buyer. then the brave new world expansion added even more, so if youre able just buy it all.",118.1
"i liked the game. and i never liked any other strategy games this much!",34.7

"this game is the pinnacle of strategy, just the feel alone of controlling an entire empire rises above all else. i must say some areas of the game could be improved like the ai but if you get bored of many subjects in the game there is always mods to think about. dlc is also something to think about, even though its the price of the game i feel that it adds many more hours to the game and is worth the money. ive been playing this since it came out and im still enjoying it, with many civilisations and playstyles to choose from sid meiers civilisation 5 is the complete turn based strategy game. 9/10",360.2

"its not fast paced but is very strategic. i like it and if thats what you are interested in then you will too. it is filled with real history and leaders. the graphics are great! i also realy like the hexagons rather than the boxes from old civ games. some reviews say that its like watching paint dry but i would disagree. its not action filled, but the point is to give you time to develop your strategy.",25.9

"you will lose plenty of sleep because of this game, it will pull you in and it wont let you out, but you really wont care while playing it. you will look at your clock before playing the game and figure you have a few hours, 15 hours later, you will be in your underwear, with pizza sauce on your chin, and you can hardly stay awake as you are trying to complete your manhattan project to finally build a nuke to unleash nuclear devistation on the opposing civilization of your choosing. once you do, you wont stop until the whole map is yours, and once it is, your face will have the largest smile youve ever had because of all the work youve put forth. all in all, buy the dang game! 10/10",86.3
"i had burned the cities of my enemies, explored the world, and finally gotten people to wear my blue jeans. until zulu denounced me to everyone because i bought some land on the same continent as him. this immediately threw my relationships with the rest of the world into termoil and turned my allies against me. my only friends to this day are the city-states that were unlucky enough to become caught inside of my great wall. the world burns and the nukes fall on all of their cities, but at least my people are happy because of zoos. 12/10 better than real history. without all the genecide... maybe some of the genecide... yeah, i lied... theres a lot of genecide.",45.5

"5th iteration on the civilization series. increased tactical gameplay through a one unit per tile policy. major focus is still on civilization management, city development, and research vs income vs population happiness balancing. playstyle heavily influenced by social policy decisions. recommended for anyone that hasnt played the civilization series yet, recommended for on sale purchase for anyone else.",26.2
"civ 5 has made several changes to the base game systems. some have worked (medieveal warfare is a blast), might work (simpler happiness system) - some not (culture, ai cannot handle the 1 unit per tile rule). that being said, the game is still solid, and the major dlc (gods and kings, brave new world) has only added to the experience.",774.5
"civilization 5 is a alright arcade strategy game and one i use to really enjoy but now that i have expanded into the strategy genre this game has become pretty dull to me plus the multiplayer is  and full of bugs also in the late game it can become overwhelming with a map full of cluttered . if you are new to strategy games and want to sink alot of hours into something then this is your game but if you want something a little more indepth and realistic then you should try the total war series.",136.7

"i cannot give any kind of review. i am not able to play due to the game doesnt proceed past the intro when it starts skipping like a broken record. yes, i have all the minimum requirements necessary plus more. i should be able to run and play several games at the same time however, as i said, i cannot even access this one. best of luck to anyone who is able to play this game.",0.7

"this game requires so much patience. but that is the entire problem with this game. i have zero. civ v is a really good game for what is... a strategy game. with that being said, this is the most uninteresting, most boring game i have ever played... ever. if i had more patience i might like it but until they make an update or something instead of always doing the same thing; making a city, make the pyramids and then continue. you dont have to take my word for it if you like strategy games then get it. you will realize that your wife left you for some  game that is the same  over and over again. anyway dont trust gandhi.",23.3
"this game is really addicting, the first 5 minutes i got hooked",25.4
"as a fan of the entire civilization franchise, civ v ranks up there as one of, if not the very best. many functionalities have been streamlined while most core elements remained, providing a true civ experience, with rich depth that was almost lacking in pervious iterations. brave new world expo is a must, as it adds the perfect amount of customization and choice to the player for it to be one of the best 4x games out there. loved the game and would reccomend it to anyone.",313.9

"the vanilla version of this game offers a pretty solid base game, the game settings lets you spice up every new playthrough, which gives a really great replaying value. the ai is hard to please but its nothing that you wont be able to handle on your second playthrough. the expansions themselves enrich the game, offering a lot of diversity on how you want to win, plus, with both expansions you can access a variety of free community content (maps, civs, buffs and nerfs for certain gameplay aspects,etc). if youre looking to kill time this is one of the best games out there to do it.",776.2

"seriously... this game was made by the devil to make people have so much fun they forget to go to bed, and then church, and then just one more turn...",221.5
"taken a lot of pleasure from civilization v and its two expansion. however, i do not recommend the base version without both the gods&kings and brave new worlds expansion packs, they greatly improve balancing and general game play this is a conditional thumbs up",1065.8
"how can you not be overwhelmed by civilization v? its a perfect example of a series thats getting close to perfection, step by step. the new improvements are great and feel like theyve been there all along. a must-buy for the fans and a great way for newcomers to finally get familiar with the series.",374.7
"a great turn based strategy game that is only worth playing with the major expansions installed. once you have those it becomes an engrossing experience that will have you uttering the timeless one more turn...",177.2
"civ v has sucked up so much of my time. ridiculously addicting and fun. definitely play with friends if you can, but single-player is great as well!",95.7
"i feel as though now is a good time to write a review of civ v, given the relatively recent release of civ: byond earth. if you are new to the civ franchise buy this game. in comparison to civ: be, this game is so much more polished and generally better (but only with all the dlc. without the dlc, civ be is better). once beyond earth gets its own share of overpriced but high quality dlc, it will become the go-to civ game, but right now civ v is the number one title in the series.",88.4
"my friend always builds the great library before me. but sometimes i build it first and he asks for a restart. everytime he gets it i just try to kill him. i team up with the other friend that plays to kill him. we fail. our empires get nuked. we rage quit. he always wins and keeps playing by himself just to try to capture all our empires. 200 hours go by. 10/10 would try to build the great library again.",256.8
"theres a learning curve but plenty of guides available; turn-based games arent for everyone, but this one is pretty interesting.",558.8

"im still learning, but i am totally addicted! my husband and i both bought this game to play with our son. love it.",84.8
"this is probably the best turn based game out there. never attempt to play before bed.",47.6
"do not buy this game if you like having free time. its not a game one simply picks up for an hour or so. it is the video game equivalent of heroin: it will suck away hours of your life at a time, leaving you in a stupor afterwards, thinking only about when you can boot it up next and finally knock off that a-hole suleiman for good. its terrible but, its so, so good.",230.1
"addicting, and a hell alot of fun! alot of ways to win, and the multiplayer is super fun!",4.3
"i loved this game while it worked on my computer. after mac osx (maverick) came out, civ has no longer been compatable with my mac. waiting for aspyre or someone to come up with a patch, or some information to fix this. -_-",429.0
"just as addictive as all the previous civilizations. a wide variety of civilizations to pick from with different units and benefits that give you a slight edge in certain playstyles. a worthy successor.",92.5
"the best civilization of the whole franchise so far! totally recommended to even gamers with no experience in strategy at all. very friendly and informative menus coming with awesome graffics and the characteristical just one more turn gameplay! a must get for everyone! p.s. thanks man for gifting it to me <3",24.7
"i sat down and told myself i would play for 1 hour. *12 hours later* yeah! get nuked russia! *falls asleep*",247.8
"by far one of the best game series ive ever played. theres endless hours of fun in this game. yet some would probably prefer earlier versions of the series. regardless if you manages to get sucked into this franchice, youd have endless hours of fun with it.",140.6
"great game but it will be nice if you get a new leader with units and a bonus everytime your first one reaches its death",309.6
"this is an addictive turn-based strategy game that will keep you at your computer for hours at at time! i always find myself saying ill play just one more turn, then ill get off then i find myself playing 15-20 more turns before i finally pull myself away. this is because theres always something interesting happening during every turn and you feel the need to take advantage of it. this game also has low specifications, so you dont need a super fast computer to play it. fun, immersive, historical, and captivating - definitely worth the price!",161.3

"game play is solid, has instructions for noobs, and works great, even on old boxes",168.0
"great fun civ v has great single palyer and for me runs smoothly. however multiplayer on the other had is terrible. you cant stay in a single, well functioning game for more than 10 turns at the most. i would recommend for people who will play it single player but would recommending not buying it for multiplayer until a patch is released.",626.2
"jeeze, dont even get me started on this game. just play it... oh wait, you probably already are.",231.5
"when i first bought this game i was like ok this is the stupidest game ive ever played. but when i figured out what i was supposed to do i slowly became more pulled in to the game. it went from trying to find some ancient ruins to trying to take over all the city states denouncing me. so far i ony have 6 hours but i assure you it will become more than that. i would defs reccomend this game.",30.8
"got elected the leader of the free world, then next turn nuked ever major city on earth. 10/10",95.6
"its civilization, the latest edition. the civ ais all seem pretty similar, and politics means jack. expect every world leader (except maybe one or two) to constantly lie to you. they will form a city near you, then complain to you that youre building cities to close to their territory. the politics actually reminds me a lot of alpha centauri. just expect a fight, constantly. get as many of the city states on your side as possible, its the best way to stay ahead. i did manage to surround germany with submarines while i was poland and constantly lied about not worrying about the buildup of troops near the borders. felt a little poetic when i just invaded because i felt like it.",27.3
"ive been a fan of civ since civ 4 which i know isnt long but nonetheless civ is still one of the best strategy games ive played and probably always will be. i would highly recommend it.",31.1
"right now, i have 171 hours spent on this game. doesnt that say it all? its amazing, addictive, but mindless enough you can play it on one monitor whilst watching a movie on the other. i highly recommend the mods. a lot of them build really nicely on the vanilla game, adding a lot more units and styles of play. i almost always play with mods now because the changes are too good to ignore.",197.6

"awesome game, the amount of time i spent playing is too damn high! haha",140.5
"got sucked into this pretty quickly, but you have to spend quite some time to learn how exactly the game works to begin with... and expect single rounds to take up multiple hours as well. but if you are patient and like strategy games, ya oughta go for it.",101.0
"sidmeiers civilization v is an ok game. fun to play with friends overall but gets boring after a little while. i do recommend this game to you if you like puzzel and history games. other than that its an ok game.",24.2
"most addictive game ever... i have 160 hours on it and there is always something new",165.5
"awesome game, very fun and in depth. also gives free trading cards. yay!",61.7
"great strategy game, a bit laggy in the advanced stages of the game. turns from a swift strategy game into a lagging monstosity rather quickly. everything upto that point is more than fine though",93.4
"culture, science, religion... gold.. these are the stuff of civilization. an excellent marriage of strategy, turn-based combat, and resource managment. lose sight of your civilizations goal... and neighbouring leaders may leave you in the dust. leaders come and go... cities crumble... so too will the tangible relationships of your family and friends as you whisper to yourself just one more turn",66.9
"one of the best games ever made, bit like pringles once you pop you cant stop. kiss your social life goodbye a game takes all day. even more fun playing with your mates. i reccomend enabling the turn timer though even if your slow  noob mates whine about turns going too quick. youll be glad you set it in the end (60 second turn speed civ ftw!). the brave new world expansion fixes a lot of the issues the original had and the tech tree is a lot more balanced, get it. you need this in your life, well at least untill december 2014 when civilization: beyond earth is released.",290.9
"this is a great game. always enjoyable to play whenever your bored. dlc is great too.",191.3
"a classic. complex, but worth learning. one of the best games of all time (if you also have the expansions for it: gods and kings & brave new world, also note that brave new world is the more recent expansion and adds all of the functionality of gods and kings but does not include the civilizations from gods and kings). highly addictive gameplay that will have you staying up too late for just one more turn. with a great range of difficulty levels there is something here for everyone: from the civ rookie all the way up to strategy pros. cant recommend this game enough!",587.8
"from the simple worker manegment to the complicated war and city control, the game is truly the best for your money.",452.2
"this is the greatest game ive ever played! i love it! i have over 200 hours logged into this game! from the war to the peace! it is my favorite game of all time!",494.7
"this is quite a fun turn-based 4x game. i own all the expansions and playable cultures, and i really enjoy the variety of playable peoples. the game is moderately taxing on the graphics card, but the real bottleneck comes from the cpu while it processes all the ai turns, particularly in the late game on a large map. i really enjoy this game, and i must admit that i have succumbed to the one more turn... bug on several occasions.",132.6
"engrossing, worthy of the civiliaztion legacy. the hexes and stack removal make it very much more like a traditional tabletop wargame, something which i found enjoyable.",129.2
"after playing this for just an hour i was instantly hooked on it. this game is amazing and i recommend it to all strategy fans. 10/10",91.6
"best game on steam, i could go into how amazing everything is but it is to much to type in my lifetime so just get it. also brave new world dlc is needed for the best play",1064.1
"i wish i could add more npc players to the game without it actually making it harder for me to win. whats the default for a normal-sized map? like, six players? well, on the right difficulty setting, thats a fun challenge; not too easy, and not to frustratingly difficult like it could be if there were more players to complete world wonders before me and things like that. having more civilizations in one game makes it seem deeper and more varied, though! it adds flavor. i wish i could add, like... secondary civilizations, (from the full list, not just city-states, because city-states are boringly two-dimensional), but just have them kind of suck, so that im only playing against like five or so empires that are actually challenging to overcome. is that a strange request?",387.4
"yup buy it and then rule the world and raze stuff :)",94.7
"its civ, you should know what your getting. i really enjoy this game with the expansions but it does have a learning curve. without expansions it can be alittle broken.",90.9
"this game is the gold standard of strategy turn-based games.",306.7
"extremely fun but the gameplay mechanics are very buggy for example in multi player when you send someone a trade offer they can change it before you can say yes or no, meaning that they can take your city.",52.3
"i have been a huge sid meiers fan ever since civ 2 and i love the civilization series, you can really get bored of ir and you can make your own nations and armies and attack others, control currency, build education, resources and much more. very well made game. the only thing that grinds my gears when it comes it sid meiers is that the dlc cost so much money. the gods and kings dlc is $29.99 which is the cost of the whole civilization v game itself.",10.3

"the game that keeps on giving. civilization has come a long way from the first release in 1991 (which i still occasionally play) to the 5th edition (plus addons). the idea of building your own empire throughout history is still captivating. one of the best features of the game is that the player can decide on what victory conditions to pick: discovery, culture, ... and yes, military style as well. although in my eyes secondary for a good game, the graphics add to my overall opinion of two thumbs up. the only item i definitely miss is a thick manual to read (like in the good old days) while the game is downloading and installing. ps: dont trust ghandi. :-)",451.3

"this game can make you forget that free time has other uses. it is an incredibly addictive strategy game that takes away large portions of your life. a single game can take over eight hours to finish (on the standard speed, it can be set to go faster or much slower), so this isnt a game for the impatient. since its turn-based you can also easily do other things while playing, making it good for multi-taskers, though playing so casually will extend the already lengthy game times. i highly recommend both the gods & kings and brave new world expansions, as they both add a variety of new and interesting mechanics to keep each game unique. there are some issues, mostly with the multiplayer; mods are not supported in multiplayer - no matter how little they change the game - and the ai becomes much less interactive and therefore much more boring during multiplayer games.",210.3

"fun game, spent many hours playing. however be warned, i found i had the most fun near the beggining of the game exploring the area and meeting other people, but near the middle to end half it feels extreamly repedative as you are stuck in an endless routine of upgrading buildings but hardly doing anything ells, and when you do have the forces to bulldoze everyone your forced to take what feels like years to get your troups from one end of the map to the other (oh the feels if you need to call upon reinforcements). thus having a large army is a huge burden as you have to micromanage everything. love the game though as i rage against gahndis lack of morality, but i feel taken advantaged of do to there being so many dlcs that it feels like the basic game is only half finished. ill give it a 7/10 but if there werent so many dlcs id give it a 8.5/10",179.7

"now, this game is amazing...of course youre gonna need the dlc brave new world to get the full experiance that you should have, which the gold edition does include for cheaper. i bought the gold edition whenever it was out for sale that had took off a lot of the price. personally, i would wait for it to go on another sale to get it because it is a pretty high price without the sale. so, overall i would say it would get a 4/5 star rating with brave new world, base game on only 2.5/5. it just doesnt have a good enough amount of game with it. so, yes i would definitley reccomend this game to anyone looking for an amazing 4x game they can play with friends or solo.",20.6

"definitely a good game. though, if youre not getting the complete edition dont buy. definitely not worth buying if youre only going to get the base game. the dlc and expansions really form the game. on to the checks! steam workshop? double check. replayability? double check. friend friendly? eh. its to your liking. insomniac gameplay? eh. but some games take forever. be warned. pc must-have? check",52.6

"civ v is a truly amazing game that once you started simply cannot stop. theres no such thing as a short civ game. you sit down at 4pm thinking youll only play for an hour, then you glance over at the clock and notice youve spent the last 4 hours locked in a slow-moving land war against france. i feel like civ is perhaps the best strategy games i have ever played, or at the very least in the top three.",100.6
"(note: i played a lot more of this during the elongated time my internet was down) sid meiers civ v is an awesome turn based stratergy game rich in content and only deepened by the vast collection of online mods. gameplay is simple at first but surprisingly deep and addictive. you pick a leader, and you rule your country. you start with only a few units and anciet technology but soon amass yourself with large armies, and highly advanced mordern technology. forging alliances with leaders is fun but the ai is rather idiotic at times and that can be troublesome, but its only a small problem for such a well made game. just one... more... turn",67.6

"i dont really like turn based games, but this game is differnent and i love the way there are progression trees for both policies and tech, thus maximizing possibilites for each player in the game. the multiple victory conditions are also good as they variate how people play the game so it is not repetitive and not everyone has the same goals. there are plenty of civilizations to choose from ranging from england to even civilizations like the zulu. unfortunatly i find multiplayer can be a bit poor because the games can last a long time and people like to quit, i find this makes it best to play with your friends as you can save game and continue with them later.",170.2

"as with the previous civilizations fromm 1 to 4 civ 5 is an extremely addictive game. very good graphs and the amazing thing is how balanced it is compared to civ 4. from the beggining till the end of one of your games you get what i call the one more turn... disease. you need to close your pc and do your work or go to sleep and you say ok 1 more turn and ill close it. 3 hours later you watch the clock and say oh my god!.. ok 1 more turn and ill close it... highly recomended even for children, since its also an educational game, as long as you can control them! :)",108.2
"great game. i have played a few of the civ games and liked them to varying degrees. civ 5 though has probably the best all around game play though. i thoroughly enjoy both the long and short run games. the workshop makes the game even more fun. i also highly recommend all the dlcs as they add a lot of unique features that increase the playability of the game and various scenarios that can be quite challenging",332.6

"the hexagonal layout and new city defense system refreshes the gameplay and fixes the absurd unit stacking of civ iv. though its not as deep and diverse as civ iv. online mode is bugged and nearly impossible to enjoy which is a major downside. many balance issues and some bugs are fixed via the civilization v unofficial patch (civup) and vanilla enhanced mod (vem). overall its worth giving it a try as there is a demo on steam. its not the successor everybody was waiting for but its a step into the right direction.",24.4

"this is one of my all time favorite games. its a strategy came, but since you play in turns and not time, theres no stress. and its not the type of game where you do the same things over and over again. there are several ways to win, several ways to play, so you dont get bored right away. i just love it!",125.5

"a true overhaul of the civilization franchise. this game brings in big changes. the most notable being the hex-based gameplay and the removal of unit stacking. those two things greatly change the way you play the game, and definitally for the better. the overlay is improved, and now when you end your turn the game doesnt pull you to each city and force you to choose what building/unit to build. which is a small, but much needed improvement. the new systems also make smaller empires more vialbe. being the biggest and baddest empire is no longer the primary concern. the game also makes it very easy to download and install mods, which further improves the game. its good, and feels like civilization while still offering a fresh experience.",174.5

"must...get...sleeeep! this games literally took over my life. the first turned based game i have ever played. this game is so complex, very rewarding though. if you enjoy history or simply enjoy the idea of creating a civilization and see how countries develop and react to certain scenarios than this game is for you. you can play a long complex game that will take you hours to complete or a quick game. i recommend you have a clock by your pc or you will lose track of time, kiss your loved ones goodbye!!!!!!!!!!!",103.5

"this is one of those games that makes you just play the original again. it was really fun on my first play-through, but by my third i realized that aside from aribitrary choices the games were the same, and looked the same even on different planet types with different civs. as far as i can tell there is no replay value. where civ v has had me playing at least once a month since i got it, im typing this review because it seems more fun than loading up beyond earth right now. there are no science/cultural/domination/diplomatic victories. winning is tied to quests and building certain buildings youve researched. i thing 2/3rds of the replay value of civ v was trying different types of victories and different civs. this has none of that. its nostalic, pretty at first glance, but its a ization of civ v, worth only one play through. its very expensive dlc at best. solid c grade product.",882.1
"highly addictive combination of simulation and turn based strategy. if youre a fan of civ, this wont let you down. if youve never played any of the civ series, i definitely think this game wont let you down. its an interesting mix between age of empires and sim city, for lack of a better comparison.",1003.2

"this is my first civ game and let me just say that its made a great impression, me and my friend just havent stoped playing. dominating whole countries and having your whole empire crumble from one mistake. this game is a must have, the multiplayer is also a wonderful and fun time, just make sure you bring friends and a glass of water cause things can get stressful. 10/10",93.4

"welp, besides the semi-constant crashing and what not, im ok with this game. and more intrested with the game mods, even for bronies like me, with many civ mods for equestria, crystal empire, and changelings. oh, and there is some wow and middle earth/lotr mods in there too. 7/10 would play it, but not worth getting or having my freinds get it.",69.2

"a very addicting game. youll find yourself thinking just one more turn indeed... ...to the point of forgetting how much time passed. i found myself thinking this would have a very high learning curve, after hearing all the strategy needed to play a civilization game (this is the first in the civ series that ive played), but soon found out that its not so bad once you get the hang of the gameplay.",48.8

"i cant recommend civilization v because it didnt evolve the right way. the gameplay is decent, but could be improved a lot by listening to the community. mods, even interface ones, arent supported in multiplayer. there are a lots of bugs in multiplayer too. and finally, the artificial intelligence is terrible; or to be more precise, the tactical ai is terrible, unable to fight a war decently. there are a lots of good idea and improvements in civ v compared to civ iv, but it doesnt make it a best game. go for europa universalis iv instead.",259.6
"the most addictive turn-based strategy game ive ever played.",134.3
"this game is really fun ecspecially with all the different options you can change, although the brave new world dlc drastically improves it (highly recommend bnw dlc). be warned though unless you play with very few other players or on fast difficulty only than this game will burn through all of your daylight hours, but maybe you want that to happen?",373.2
"it is the beststrategy game there is in my opinion.",130.3

"its really strange that this game and civ iv are such different titles. the fundamentals are all there, but itll be a bit of a learning process comming to civ v over from civ iv. its still just as addicted as iv, but the aforementioned is something to keep in mind.",2.1

"i had only played civ rev on the xbox until i bought civ 5 - and i am in love. it is so much more in depth with so much to do and so many more options. unless you only play on one of the easy modes, you really have to know what youre doing and i love that.",243.7
"i have played this game and attempted all victory conditions other than end game (end of game at 2050). and it has been suprisingly fun. although getting the mechanics of this game can be rather difficult for me, as i did not read much in depth when there was a tutorial.",40.8

"i sat down at 5:00pm and started to play this game. dinner time came, and i passed up food so i could keep playing, 11:00pm roled around and i stayed up, the sun camp up and i stayed up to play some more....at 8:30am i realized ive not only been playing for 19 hours without stopping, but i missed my first class....if you want a game to eat your soul and make your life a peace of crap.....please join me in my sadness!",235.7
"some times this game keeps me up all night, then i have to go to work. maybe i shouldnt recommend this game",761.7
"this game is great. the expansions even better. best in the series by far. i could play 400 turns and still not be bored at all!",257.9
"pretty addicting game but its definitely not optimized. it uses like a gig of ram just on the main menu and loading times are crazy even on decent computers. content-wise its really great though. beat deity mode in 2 minutes, could use some balance. culture mode = challenge mode. some civs are better than others. religion rush op. id say 8/10 actual gameplay, 7/10 overall because of experience in loading screen and ram issues",114.1
"just got into the civ series with this game. as a new civ player, the single player content alone was worth buying the game. civ veterans seem to disagree on this based on other reviews i read. i let my brother try it and he got hooked. i woke up to him still playing the next morning, so i got it for him for and unlike others, we havent seen any multiplayer issues, yet (hopefully this continues). i think its important to note that i found this game looking for a new rts and it is filling the role quite nicely even though it is turn based and not filled with the fast paced battles i am used to. if anything, the slower pace and individuality of each unit makes it more fun than your everyday rts.",261.4
"havent played much yet on this account, but i still own every single dlc, including gods and kings and brave new world. the first thing to say about this game is that it is very new user friendly and have real diversity among difficulty levels. so if you havent tested this game and like rts, history, strategy and even turn based games, plus this is an awesome lan-game. if you have played civ iv and v and you had played iv first, you probably liked iv more. but i bet that if you buy gods and kings dlc and maybe bnw, youll start to realize that these two games are good in their own ways and maybe youll start to prefer civ v over iv. this is a game for intelligent, curious, enthuastic people and even for kids to try(kids should probably play on the settler difficulty setting, because theyll get owned by other difficulty levels). plus youll have to be a genius to beat deity difficulty.",44.5
"best rts ever made, and in my personal top 10 games of all time. in civ 5, you assume the role of a past great leader, like washington, ghandi, queen elizabeth and so on. you rule and control their respective countries build your own empire. you do so by raging war, or making peace with others. i highly recommend buying at least the two major expansions. (gods & kings, and brave new world). theyre huge really game changing expansions. like adding religion to the game, which could mean the difference between friendship or nuclear war. as far as time goes, you start in the year 4000 bc (by default). and progress your empire through the ages all the way into the future. even though beyond earth (next entry in civ) is already on the horizon, civ 5 is a true masterpiece. buy this game now.",102.2

"ive only played 10 hours and this game is  amazing. careful to not get stuck in the just one more turn loop if youre playing alone... ive legitimately lost sleep because of how kickass this game is. in that 10 hours i still havent finished a normal game. i think im in the medieval era still, so be prepared for some long  games if you set it to normal game length.",158.2

"best turn based strategy title there is, 2nd to chess perhaps. and when compared to the predecessors, the designers have definitely worked on making the alternative victory strategies more viable. however the ais negotiation capacity and reasoning still leaves much to be desired for a game that appeals to the machiavelli in us.",160.8
"oh, sid meier, consumer of so much spare time. civ 5 is no different. things have been streamlined from the earlier games, and the ai does a halfway competent job of managing things so you can ignore some of the minutiae of running a vast empire, but you might not want to anyway. empires need to be focused tightly in civ5, so the sorts of things that work for large empires wont work for small ones, and vice versa. one thing civ5 does really well is variety, and theres so much of that. so many civs, abilities, units, ways to build/manage your empire... the fifth installment takes everything you loved about the older civs, keeps that stuff, and adds new stuff. its just a wonderful game.",103.4
"probably one of the best tbss ive ever played. definitly an improvement and a new wrinkle since the third installment which i also own. some of the new mechanics make it really interesting and im also glad to see the days of a warrior beating a tank are over. very nice.",641.1

"i am very disappointed with this game. there appears to be some convenient glitch within the software that conspicuously happens when the game is losing terribly. my version of sid meiers civilization v stops working and shuts down almost every other day and sometimes multiple times a day. it happens most often after i have delt a devastating blow in the game that significantly benefits me. i have invested many many hours in this game and if this is the products design then i say this was a bad investment of my money and my time. i would not buy this product again. sincerly, bs",370.5
"one of my favourite games. it is so expansive and so wonderfully done, a treat to any fans of the series or turn-based strategy games in general. i love changing the tables of time and making the roman empire last forever as still the powerful people or making the native indian be the ones who attack america and make them loose their homeland. it is also a game where you cant help but spend an entire game on because you want to get that one goal or ahievement hunt (which takes many many hours of playing to time to find because of how diverse the game is). i would recomend this to anyone.",681.7
"i definitely reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys strategic turn battles and taking over the world. also, genghis khan can form an alliance with napoleon bonaparte :d.",181.4
"an amazing game that only is benefitted by its gods and kings expansion and the extra civilization dlcs. i started back with civiii, and im still going strong with the series. sid meiers civilization is the mother of all god games, where you are able to control everything about your country, from the big picture of scientific research and diplomacy to the micromanagement of individual citizens and soldiers. definitely at least try the game.",510.4
"if you have even looked at this game and considered hm, looks kind of neat. then you should buy the complete edition right now. gods and kings expansion is optional brave new world is extremely good and pretty much required to make this game a 10/10 the complete edition is highly suggested. theres far too much about this game for me to ramble on about. if you need more information go look up multiple reviews that arent from steam or one source. however, you can trust me when i say, unless you absolutely hate the grand strategy genre civ5 complete edition is a must buy, especially when its on sale.",161.5

"this game is like having the most amazing  of your life and then the mailman comes right in the middle and you have to stop half-way through and rush hurriedly to the door. my point is, games take so god damn long that unless you have the next 6 hours spare, dont start a game.. because something will always come up, and online games cant be paused, mom! 3/5 overall though, i like the game, but finding the time to play it is a right ball-ache.",35.6
"historical strategy does not get any better than civ 5. allowing people to play an alternate version of history is great, and sid and his peeps at firaxis hit the nail on the head. with hours of replayability the game allows for a different story each time.",472.2

"its a good game, and you get some really funny situations at times, i had one game where i was the biggest kingdom in the world by far, atleast three times bigger that then next civ, then all 5 of the other civs declared war on me almost at once, so my people just went nope, forget this and flew off into space with a science win",112.8

"a+ material. i love this game, the soundtrack, and how relaxed it makes me. i cant wait for civ 6 if it comes. everybody should get this game. bless sid meiers heart.",370.3
"if you like strategy and changing the past, then youll love this game. go for complete package so you dont have to spend 50 more dollars.",104.8
"a very good game, i really like the turn base system that they use and i enjoyed the way different nations special troops and passive bonuss work, i would recommend this game to everyone",54.9
"although sometimes it may be a bit slow at times, it is incredibly fun alone or with friends.",241.5
"amazing game ,not boring at all can play for hours it may look s-h-i-t but its great",8.6
"one of the best strategy games ive played. immensely time consuming but great fun. 10/10",62.1
"probably the best yet in the series. my only complaint is that you need the expansions to get some of, what seem like, basic features. 8/10",19.8
"civilization has long been one of my favorite franchises, ever since i played the first one as a kid. they went through a weak period with iii, but iv was great and v is the best entry in the series yet.",164.5
"whew! after a few fun hours its time to turn this off and go to bed. whats that? its time to get up already!? yeah. it happens. with all of its dlc, 50 hours is only scratching the surface. its addicting, its exciting, and its challenging. playing with friends in to the early morning is a common occurence as you to try to out-perform and out-maneuver your opponents. its satisfying when you emerge victourious after an 8 hour game. (lets ignore the disappointment of being defeated after 8 hours). this game is well worth your money as there are many hours of fun to be had. also, the music is pretty darn good.",48.2
"the strategy game ive waited my whole life for. finally!",101.0
"with this game you can play as britain and retake what is truly ours.... the world! apart from that you can nuke whoever you want so enjoy!",74.0
"absolutely love this game. truly makes you feel like the ruler of a civilization with unlimited potential.",433.9
"10/10, would play 100 hours in the first two weeks again",165.6
"one of the best co-op games around. it is very much a strategic game while being fun all at once. you get to rule an empire while attempting to crush the other ones. its great.",170.1
"the concept of one more turn has no meaning here. fantastically addictive game. 10/10 would play again.",380.9
"this is probably a good game. ill know for sure after a few months, after which i will hopefully have finished my first game",0.2
"civilization v is a very great game, especially with the brave new world dlc. politics is dynamic and ui is very user friendly. combat is very simple, which might or might not appeal to some people. recommended!",53.2
"awesome strategy game. great replay value. can be set up as a short game or an epic one.",340.5
"its very hard to stop playing! feels like playing monopoly or risk when played with a couple friends.",80.9
"amazing game. recommend for anyone who likes a strategy game.",61.5
"this is one of the best strategy games ever. if you never played it, go play it now!",13.5
"certainly a fun game. it is fabulous to declare war with everyone on the first turn and win the game. add some friends into the mix for more awesome. i would not recommend this game to someone who is not patient. games take upwards of 3+ hours to complete on average.",46.9
"this is one of my all time favorite games. it will keep you up til early next morning...",89.4
"step 1: play aztecs step 2: kill barbarians step 3: ??? step 4: profit",239.2
"one does not simply play this game for just 30 minutes",203.3
"this game is a ton of fun if you like strategy. the original game is awesome but if you want the complete package get the two dlc packs to get religion and trading. if you like carefully avoiding war by keeping trade lines running between other civilizations or just want to crush everyone else on the map with blitzkrieg or nuclear warfare then this is the game to you. when the base game gets old(which it wont for a while) there are scenarios like the fall of rome or the civial war, and then there are tons of mods! truly an epic game for multiplayer or singelplayer. the only con i have is that games can take forever to get good.",67.4
"in cases where i feel like warmangering and cackling maniacally, civilizaion v is my go to game. worth every cent.",385.5
"my favourite game just get it as soon as u can to start playing",538.2
"civ 5 is a radical change from the previous civs in many ways, but is equally radically a step up in terms of gameplay. the switch from squares to hexes might seem small, but it makes a huge difference on how easy it is to gather resources and move around the map. the introduction of full screen shots where civ leaders move, gesture, react, and talk in their appropriately native language gives an amazing sense of connection with the past. it is, hands down, my favorite civ yet.",109.5
"made ghandi angry because i attacked monaco after they started taking territory from me. 11/10",2.3
"great game, very addictive. the game was good but the dlcs make it worth while with both gods and kings and brave new world. so much to do and so many ways to win!",166.3
"i need to play this game more. once you get into its very addictive! im glad i got it!",27.0
"one of the best games ive ever played, 150+ hours of fun and it keeps on giving. the two expansion packs are amazing and i havent even tried all the dlcs yet! you need to buy this game now!!!!!",306.1
"just. awesome. anyone who missed the humble bundle for this... you should be",102.3
"hours of endless world domination is always bound to please the conqueror in everyone.",876.9

"so addicting! heck, i could spend hours just reading the civilopedia.",135.3
"i just started playing this game and i can already tell you this game is magnifigent, truely a work of art.",24.5
"an awsome game that every strategist has to play .",194.3
"i just got this game from the humble bundle, if you like tbs games this is the most amazing game ever. i would recommend this game 10/10 to anyone who is looking for a game that you can invest time in and feel as though there is a payback. there are a ton of strategies that you can take when going about this game and i dont think that it will get old.",130.4
"this game definitely has the potential to be (one of) the best strategy game(s) of all times, but is one example of a messed up dlc policy. their are literally hundreds of purchasalbe dlcs. buy them in a bundle to save money.",241.1
"some of the personalities in this are annoying. like life. you can make friends with them and make enemies with others. like life. you can burn their villages and laugh while your troops roll over their young. .. i guess still kind of like life if you are a war lord.",16.7
"brilliant strategy game although by itself can feel empty after a while and g&k + bnw can fix this and everybody who feels like getting the best possible experience of this game should buy those main two expansion packs for the game. for anybody looking to get into the strategy genre, this can also be a good place to start. 8/10",65.5
"as soon as i downloaded this game it turned out my computer couldnt run it. looking back at the reviews i want to tell my computer to clean its **** up and run because ghandi needs a beat down. im pretty sure sid meier knew everyone would trust ghandi so he made him a sadistic nuclear frenzied psycho. i must play this game.",89.3
"over time it gets easier, but at first its hard. i like to keep it slow and just play a little bit everyday.",63.6
"spent way to much time playing this game, definitly recommend",288.4
"great game if you have 347032 hours to kill. i dont know how many weeks ive spent in real time playing this game but ive only finished 3 or 4 games and still ing love it.",1071.0
"excellent strategy game that is almost impossible to stop playing",191.9

"i love this game. its amazing with the expansion packs too. i have played so much and cant wait to play more!",147.2
"this game is amazingly fun even though ive only played a little ive not stopped playing",136.7
"insanely addicting, and a whole lot of replayability",692.0
"many of us have a country we admire, for me its russia, for my friend ransom (reisei) its japan. in civilization you play as the real world civ of your choice and see if you have what it takes to withstand the test of time. weather weather you seek to have the greatest scientist, the cultural diversity, the religouse influence, or the unstopable millitary... this is you legacy. i can play this game for hours on end against my friends and the ai. so if you ever wanted your own country, this game is perfect.",722.5
"i have a very soft spot for the civilization series. civilization iii, is, to my memory, the first game i ever played. i have since played 2, the snes version of the original, and this. like the rest of the series, its decently polished, easy to learn, has a lot of depth, and is periliously addictive. i didnt get into it as much as i did iii, but thats probably just nostalgic bias. if i had to complain, i would say that the diploacy is rather limited, and not being able to trade communications blows. thankfully, the rest of the game does it. also, i nuked beijing eleven times in a row, and it still stood, with two citzens who refused to die, district 13 style. 11/10.",35.5
"the civ series has always been amazing and this is just another addition to a long list of amazing games.",210.1
"ever wanted to build a massive empire from a small 5 man tent site to a sprawling nation ecompassing entire continents? too bad! youve got massive unhappiness from that many cities! ever wanted to field an army to rival that of rome in the second punic war against carthage? too bad! all that unit maintenance is leaving you in debt! civs an awesome game, but man can it be frustrating some times. ive never been more let down by being told i could do all these wonderful, massive things and then not being able to do them to my imagination... dont get me wrong, civs a great game, and i heartily recommend it to anybody who enjoys the idea of running a civilization, i just think it could be less restricting at times.",64.1
"this game is the slowest and most painful rage(quit) that youll ever experience in your life 10/10",168.8
"this game is great, but it can get addicting, so beware. the vannila game is good but not as good as the dlc game, its worth giving the dlc a try. one bad thing is with the vanilla game it lacks a lot of things i was used to in civ four, like stacking units, but this isnt really a huge problem, its adds to the game in a way. the replayabilty is huge, kinda like spore, and it is increased with the dlc. please get this game, it is epic! build an emipire to stand the test of time!",41.8
"this game is amazing, but it will consume your life. its impossible to play without telling yourself just one more turn at least 200 times. the vanilla game is great, but you should add a few mods to enhance the gameplay a bit because its not perfect. i definitely recommend getting brave new world as well because it adds a lot of depth.",853.1
"dont let the title fool you. this is actually not trusting gandhi simulator 10/10 would get rekt by gandhi again.",29.1
"hmm i have a life ill stop next turn... oops how did 25 turns pass oh well i guess ill stop next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next. turn.",117.4
"the only game where ghandi is an  and you want to be allies with korea. 10/10",182.7
"never spent so much time on a game in my life. lost my girlfreind and my gpa dropped 2.5 points. stayed up too late and slept in, then missed my flight to participate in the olympics. ruined my life and future. 10/10",397.1
"no other game quite matches civilization for the level of revilement and repulsion instilled in my partner whenever i play it. i say, one more turn, aware of the damage my lies will cause. she will say, ill leave you! ill call her bluff and hold out my non-dominant hand, looking away from the screen only between turns. shell plead, at least eat something! ill devour whatever meagre portion of food she gives me. assignments become secondary. work becomes secondary. life becomes secondary. holding your bladder for 15 straight hours isnt normal, on civilization it is. 10/10 would destroy life again.",316.5
"very good game, i would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy genres. the graphics for me are supurb and the little animations when you battle singleplayer! in my first game, my tank anihalated a spearmen and the animation to me very funny. great game!",92.5
"this game is great for all kinds of players. for those that like to be a war mongering leader, to those who want to out class their opponents in technology, and even for the peace lover who wants to win by diplomacy or culture. with all the expansions there are so many choices for civilizations and ways to play, the replay value is amazing. i love to personally play team games with my frineds online, but the options for freestyle single player or situation games makes this a game that i cant get enough of.",333.8
"ooh... this game.... let me explain. there have only been two issues in this game, one was a graphical thing. not a big deal. the second... the second was losing the ability to save. so that was fun... this game plays well, handles well, looks great, has excellent ai (sometimes) and has infinite replayability, no game will ever be the same. with around 40 civs, 280 achieves and 10 scenarios and hundreds of map combinations... i dont knnow how youd run out of content completionists note: hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours. have fun :)",404.9
"one of the greatest strategy games i have ever played! i recommend it to anyone interested in playing strategy games!",121.9
"one.....more....turn. incredibly addictive, cant stop playing it.",8.0
"this is probably one of my favortie games right now. if you are thinking about getting it, you need to get it.",44.4
"the one unit per tile improvement is great (no more stacks of doom, fights are more interesting). also, the ui of the game is top notch, much better than its predecessors. i highly recommend this sequel.",20.4
"i love it, my friend love it. and now i persuaded my girlfriend, she loves it too now! we had a lot of fun with it, good graphics and the talking portraits of the different civilizations, they are cozy and looks like a true copy of the real thing :p but im from denmark, so mister bluetooth voice is really weird and un-viking-like.",86.2
"probably the best game in the civ series so far. i enjoy playing it and everytime i start the game its hard to quit. i would recommend this game to every fan of the civ series and to everyone searching for a challenge and good gameplay.",30.2
"this game is like the bridge for advanced strategy games. it has such a complex, yet easily accomplishable setup. this gives civ 5 an inumerable strength as a game. it provides you with over 30 civilizations to play as(dlc included). each of them with a diverse yet interesting skill to go along with them. you could play as spain with a double bonus to all exotic tiles in the game. or switch to carthage, giving you the ability to cross mountains. both long time strategists and newcomers will love this game. as well as its historical units will excited any history buffs out there. and any game you play in it will always challenge and amuse. if you have not already bought this game, you should right now.",333.5
"best game ever but i think more civilizations are needed",351.9
"great game if you have 90000000000000000000000+ hours to spare.",73.6
"i was playing this the night before an exam. at 11pm i thought just one more turn, cause that fer casmir betrayed me and sided with china. it seemed as if only an hour later i had taken over poland, china, indonesia and venice. it was 9am. 10/10 would fail an exam again.",373.7
"i get a bsod every time i try to play it. its been working fine for about 6 months. ive logged over 120 hrs in the game. ran memory diagnostics, no issue. check disc was fine. uninstalled and reinstalled game 3 times, same issue. bsod. tried both direct x 9 and dx 10/11, same issue in both. tried running in windowed mode, same issue. the game is completely unplayable now.",162.3
"this game is pretty much addiction defined. it is the single best example ive ever played of the just one more level... syndrome. a long running strategy title where you create an empire and attempt to take over the world via military, science, or the arts, it is simple to learn and takes ages to master completely. can be considered to be age of empires older, more refined cousin.",112.0
"looks stupid but is really fun and i usualy hate stratagy games.",9.2
"this is one of the most addictive games i have ever owned. buy this game with no regrets!",97.2
"games can take days depending on your settings and yet i have never been bored of the game. each game is different on its own or you can proceed to victory in different ways. at this point i have spent more then 200 hours playing the game and it is the first game i install when i format my pc. if you like turn based strategies you will love this game.",259.4
"in what other game does your friend and ally throughout 3/4 of the game (ghandi of course, nobody else would ever do this) all of a sudden betray you, nuke your empire to the ground and send in giant death robots to mop up whatever units that your technologically inferior production starved half burning cities are able to produce. lesson learned, never trust ghandi. i 100% recommend to everybody.",813.1
"played japan and was a war-mongering warlord, then later became a science desired nation. everyone even the city states declared war on me. but its okay because when i have guns and infantry units they have basic warriors. they all sent peace treaties :) i rate 11/10 would laugh my  off again.",9.2
"still my favourite 4x game of all time. i cant recommend this game enough if you like grand strategy.",11.9
"oops its 4 am and i have to work today... just one more turn",187.9
"so imagine being able to teleport a week into the future... if you buy this game, as soon as you press play thats what happens.",48.7
"never before have i played a game as majestic as this. the graphics are simply amazing, the soundtrack immerses you in the whole experience, and its the kinda game where you sit down to play, and the next thing you know its 4 am.",442.9
"a great strategy game! every dlc is extremely worth it! only problem is moving units one by one is slow",97.1
"its one of the best games of his category. very enjoyable in single player but multiplayer is hard to play with others",112.9
"what can i say that hasnt been said about the civilization series? this game is a staple in pc gaming, almost everyone owns it and plays it on the reg. to this day still one of my all time favs.",193.3
"greater accessibility and refined combat mechanics vastly improve civilization, at little cost to the depth and complexity that has come to be expected. 9.6/10",146.3
"ive played all the civ games, and this is my favorite.",185.4
"amazing strategy game! so fun to play, endless amounts of fun. it doesnt need a good computer to play on, nor is it too hard to understand when you first get into it! i recommend everyone that is getting into pc or strategy games to play this game first, youll learn so much and develop your skills so much!",76.1
"great game...easy to spend hours playing it and not even know it.",748.1
"exceptionally well designed gameplay, one of the most beautiful soundtracks ever composed and all that multiplayer supported. you like strategic board games and complex econemy systems? then this game is a must buy for you!",23.1
"the games great when you are able to get into a position of having a sustainable civilization. however, getting to that point is made borderline impossible considering the ai declares and seemingly keeps a perpetual war going. or, theres the occasional bad luck of getting placed in a very difficult if not impossible part of the world to develop in. these two flaws go hand in hand. all things considered, i like the game but i cant give a good recommendation if one cant even get to a point in which they can actually play the game past the medieval era. sorry.",105.6
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",316.9
"one of the best stategy games i have ever played :d",98.3
"addictive and very intense! recommend to anyone who likes strategy gamess",156.6
"great game! so fun being able to win without firing a single shot but also to have the option to nuke cities if i want :)",183.7
"a game that really can spend whole day sitting infront of the pc and play. even more interesting and fun when you have lots of friends playing together as all of us can plan with their own style and battle among each other to know whos the best strategist.",93.4
"i love this game. the reason i dont recommend it is youll end up doing nothing all day because of this game. i usually play this on hotseat mode with a friend and one time, i was nearly charged of kidnapping because she stayed in the house for 36 hours.",95.3
"pretty bad for my classes. pretty good for my empire.",31.4
"this game is great, and you should buy it! simple as that.",216.7
"im not even a fan of strategy games but dang this game is great",20.6
"fantastic, but im currently waiting on the next installment. still, highly recommended",83.4
"great game, very fun to play and make decisions with friends.",189.7
"just one more turn 20/10 would lose all aspects of life again.",113.4
"this game would probably be a lot better if my friends werent so  and played with me. but other than that great game, make sure you get both expansions!",51.1
"probably one of my favorites of the civilization series in general. ive played every one since civ ii - and this one is certainly at the top of the list. as easy or as hard as you want it to be, so many options exist that you have an almost infinite amount of replay potential. the only bad thing i have to say about it is that the ai for worker automation is rather poor. once your civilization has a ton of workers, it gets confused and theyll just sit on the same tile changing out the building there over and over. beyond some little kinks like that, one of the best.",386.6
"amazing game, really pulls you in once you get the basics. a lot of variation and endless fun with your friends. definitely a must have.",171.4
"civ v is a must-have game for any strategy game lover. it has everything they could want in a game. economy, military units, diplomacy, multiple victory conditions, different civilizations, and so on. the only thing lack luster in this game is the diplomacy. civilization games just never have had a stellar diplomacy engine. the a.i. has always been a little derpy but nothing that can be frustraiting. just dont be expecting help from allies, or many allies for that matter.",113.5
"great game. very indepth andd quite extensive research trees. by far the best civ yet.",16.8
"one of the best civilization games, or for that matter empire building games, to date. be tactical, be religious, be cultural, be scientific... the possibitlys are endless...",114.0
"yesh awesome game :d if youre into games like spore at the civilization stage buy this now",197.2
"best game ever !!!.i wish there was a scenario maker",125.7
"probably one of the best sid meiers games out there at this moment",29.5
"very fun and addicting game, worth the $15 for just the game and will leave you wanting more :)",273.3
"all the civilization games are worth the time. who doesnt love an awesome turn-based strategy game? however, the developers should have spent more time of getting this game more stable, especially in multiplayer.",655.9
"the vanilla civ v is definitely still a great game, but really only shines with the big dlc (bnw and g&k). the dlcs give civ v the replay-ability you look for in a civ game. so, if you can snag the whole bundle in a steam sale theres probably one of the best purchaes on steam you could make.",476.2
"one of the most addicting games i have ever played!!! i highly recommend this to anybody to loves strategy games! 9.5/10",364.4
"play this game if you dont mind losing hours of your life without realizing it. it is highly addictive!",33.7
"ive got over 50 hours played but the funny thing is, is that ive only sat down to play it maybe 8-9 times......so lets just say i developed the wait one more turn then im done disease. you will too i guarantee.do yourself a favor and just buy it.",56.2
"very well made game. still the best of its kind after several years and is a fun new experience every time you play. good game at improving your micromanaging skills as well as macro.",78.4
"sid meiers civ v is a must have if you are a fan of turn based strategies. giving you the ability to play as 50+ civilizations from 6000+ years of history it allows you to build them up your way while playing against or with other nations. civ v gives you the ability to create your own social policies, religions, chose the global path as a un leader on a diplomatic battle ground putting sanctions and embargos on countries and city-states in your way. build a masive army to back yourself with, with the assistance of nuclear blastic missles and giant death robots you can watch as the world around you burns! or create the perfect eutopia if your heart so desires. steam work shop with its thousands of choices makes this game worth it even more. 10/10",238.6
"awesome game to kill a couple hours when you should be sleeping.",72.4
"great game, if you havent played it what are you playing? go and buy it",40.7
"civ. v is amazing, awesome animations and hours and hours can be put into one single game. requires srategy!",71.5

"excercise your brain and your imagination with this excellent strategy game that spans the human history of the earth! rewrite history in your own image through military force, or become the world ambassador through negotiaions and technological advancement! the possibilities are endless, choose a country and go dominate the world. one . . turn . . at a time!",69.9
"take over the world, capture workers, and nuke cities. 10/10",272.6
"i beat ghandi in a nuclear war but lost to korea in science...fml 10/10",46.7
"this game is extremely addicting, for alot of reasons. you can play as civilization leaders and guid your civilizations to war, peace, production, and much more! you can make tons of diffrent types of troops! some cost resorces (sorry if i spelt that wrong) but in the end its worth it. you can make tons of buildings,creat citys farms, fortresses, mines, and much more! if you lose happiness and money, alot of bad things will happen. in the end this game is extremly addicting and has tons of stuff that im sure youl like!",211.8
"this game is addictive, amazing, and i hate it so much.",327.0
"this game is verry fun and addicting. a surprising feature i found on it was the ability of hotseat play, which allows more than one person to play this game on the same computer!",98.6
"terrible, its like total war but campaign map only. no battlemechanics what so ever, even if its not a wargame it should not play like a ipad game. the tech tree is dull too. overall - really  dont buy it, totalwar rome i is much better.",70.3
"yes, been playing all of these game for years, highly reccomended",30.9
"fantastically well done game, each expansion pack completely revamps systems.",182.8
"i could play this game for hours on end and never get bored. very great game.",217.1
"very good a lot of fun and the mods are super 10/10",341.5
"really addictive game that will keep you up until the very early hours of the morning. at which point, you will promise yourself that this will be the last turn before bed, but you contiune until the sun pops up from over the horizon and there isnt any point in going to sleep anymore.",594.4
"i recommend the crap out of this game. buying this game is like giving away your soul. great fun. 10/10",22.7
"this game when it came out back in 2010 i went out immediately to buy it from gamestop because i wanted a hard copy, since its release they have added great dlc and we can expect more in the future. one of my favorite turn based strategies. just like i would recommend before making any purchasing of a game watch a video on youtube and get an idea if you would like to play what youre seeing in the video. i would recommend this game to really anyone its just a great time wether youre just playing singleplayer or multiplayer.",658.1

"just a couple more turns then ill stud- napoleon has declared war on your empire oh, that er.",8.3
"very good time waster game. however can get old quick if you dont have anyone to play with regularly. enjoyed that i could go in and learn a little a bit about each of the leaders and get a bit of learning while playing a strategy game.",97.3
"i love this game and best of all i can play it anywhere with my surface pro.. the touch screen functions work amazing! great great great game",19.4

"i get to play as the roman empire and go to war with 3 different germanies at once. 10/10",26.8
"a must have for any world building psychopath or tactical mastermind. command your civilization and rise to the top through trade, culture, religion, and warfare, using espionage and countless ways to reshape history forever!",259.6
"it is my favorite of the series. it simplifies the game compared to 3 and 4 which was always a turn off to me. the matches will last a good 8+ hours even if its against a computer. 8/10 for me.",72.8
"absolutely fantastic game. it takes a lot of time that youll be happy you spent having fun.",204.3

"at first, gods and kings was satisfying enough, but then late game began to suffer from a militaristic -focused drive. either you steamrolled or you got steamrolled. but now with brave new world, you can break their trade routes, destory their diplomatic relationships, and strip them of everything they have before claiming their lands.",40.6
"this is a spectacular and deep strategy game for those of you with a couple (read: a ton) of hours to spare. its various map generation settings, well-functioning hotseat and online multiplayer modes, plethora of unique and interesting civilzations to play as, and varying routes to victory will keep one entertained for hundreds upon hundreds of turns. one note- the complete edition is a must-buy. gods and kings and brave new world are instrumental to having the best civ experience, as they add awesome features and necessary balance, improving the game greatly.",460.3
"sick of the game as its keeps crashing 3/4 of the way through game play. not worth the time if its crashes so often which is a shame as it is still a great game",119.7

"a different game from civ4, its finally starting to grow on me. leaner in some ways, more tactical in others. still feels as if it suffers from consolitis in that many power-user controls and options are missing (hello, can we get an in-game clock at least?). gods & kings expansion is a must.",404.2

"this is one of my favorite games to play, the realistic physics engine and amusing themes cast this game into one of the most difficult and fun strategy games ive ever played, especially now that they have added monetary constraints, the community development is superb and the game is constantly being updated and patched.",96.5
"user friendly for those who are fairly unfamiliar with the rts genre and gameplay. its addicting, enough to the point where id be up till 3am and not realize it; just blankly looking at my screen and yelling ing god damn alexander stop trying to start a war with me. it is amazingly fun and the games can go on for a very long time, i think my first game lasted about 9~10 hours. its an rts fans staple and for good reason.",19.3

"its a time-killer, for sure, but if you can spare the time, its worth it. multiple interlocking systems mean theres always something to do and always decisions to make, but no given ele.ment is too complicated to understand; everything is both intuitive and extensively documented. whether youre interested in simple growth and exploration or military strategy and tactics, theres a successful strategy that matches your tastes and style. especially with the brave new world dlc, civ v offers essentially endless variation in what you can do, multiple paths to victory, and numerous ways to fine-tune the feel during setup or play. i like 4x games in general, but this is the first time since alpha centauri that one has grabbed me, and held on, this way.",440.3

"this game is fantastic, and i love it. 4/5 for me. one problem though. literally 90% of the workshop items require the dlc brave new world. this is an extra 30 dollars. dont get it if you want mods, but dont want to spend an extra $30. other than that, fantastc game",134.9

"no other game quite matches civilization for the level of revilement and repulsion instilled in my partner whenever i play it. i say, one more turn, aware of the damage my lies will cause. she will say, ill leave you! ill call her bluff and hold out my non-dominant hand, looking away from the screen only between turns. shell plead, at least eat something! ill devour whatever meagre portion of food she gives me. assignments become secondary. work becomes secondary. life becomes secondary. holding your bladder for 15 straight hours isnt normal, on civilization it is. 10/10 would destroy life again.",316.5

"dont trust that friend of yours? this game will prove to you that you were not only right to distrust him in the first place, but that he is a hell of a better strategist then you. hours and hours wasted to prove something that takes starcraft 2 lesser than 15 minutes to deliver. but hell, when you roll up with your nukes and giant killing robots... its ing worth three weeks, 30 kg and your parents respect. also, gandhiiiii!!!!!",50.0

"better than beyond earth.and i recommend::::::buy dlcs",459.7
"this game is the most stratigic game ever, i give it 10/10 the diplomacy, screens where you talk to other civilizations and you get to interact with theam is flawless and beautiful and dont get me started on the battles, the battles are a bit hard for starters you cant march to theam and win you need lots of troops to surround the city and shoot and bombard theam cause this game is like chess, almost you get to attack and move every 1 turn once u move all your armys, and farmers,. there are many factions to play but i recommen buying brave new world next after this for more factions where talking $60 dollors all togather. so i say if you love stratigic battles and bored games of non stop enjoyment then this game is 100% for you",67.9

"for the strategist player out there, civilization v is a brilliant game, with many customisables and random worlds through each playthrough, with 4 main victory types, made even better with the dlc packs, adding religious, further diplomatic and reconnaisance aspects. overall, if you are an action gamer, look elsewhere. for the strategy players, get this. and you can always drop a nuke on someone you really dont like *cough* *poland* *cough*",56.2
"a really dang good strategy game that can be really addicting. reaching end-game and trying to kill all of the opposing civilizations was always one of my favorite parts. just dont get too into the game, or youre gonna realize that youve been playing the game for a whole year.",20.8

"a grate game. just lose for civ ii, who was the first civ game i played. this game have a love of community content like maps, civs and game modes. the just one problem is the multiplayer mode who never should exists, this game type wont be made for multiplayer.",66.6

"very entertaining. just as enjoyable as civ iii. really eats away at the time though ;)",2.4
"with all the expansions and dlc, this iteration is finally living up to the name civilization. although very different from earlier games in the series, it retains the depth, character, and addictiveness. my only disapointment is with the lack of completely game-changing mods that made civ iv into such a wide platform. overall, id recommend it with all expansions to any strategy gamer who hasnt already picked it up.",329.7
"i have followed the civilization games with fervor. when i originally bought this, i was floored. with the expansions, i had to change my entire style of play. i wont lie that upset me at first, but i have grown to enjoy the added challenge. inability to unit stack may seem like a pain, but it creates the need to strategize instead of just overpower.",651.9

"i honestly prefer civ ivs movement grid and that i dont need to keep one melee unit in my millions of archers who seemingly cannot take a town, not to mention the modern infantry being out-ranged by bows and arrows. still, the religion/city state/ideology concepts are enough to keep me playing for just one more turn",185.4
"what a game. love it. only downfall for me that the fighting was a bit more like c&c but very good",20.8
"i love the civilization series, and civ v is a great game to add to the series!",259.2
"the newest game in the civilization series and the best in my opinion since civ 2.",43.2
"i bought this game thinking the reviews, though exaggerated, were positive. 24 hours later, i realized i had to work in the morning. took one more turn, then another, once more, then went to work. almost fell asleep at work. got home, more turns. perfect distraction on the way to the grave. 10/10",71.5
"this game is drug... you can play with the history, i mean, where else you could declare war do gandhi....",52.4
"if you are into micro managed, turn based strategy games - this is the mutha fn biggest one out there. the gold edition is the way to go opening up a huge amount of races and adding in religion for even more layers to an already polished game. some of my games can take months to win depending on size and settings... or you can speed technology up and dial in a specialized area/war.... many ways to win. time, science/tech, war, diplomacy, social.... a+++ game.",226.3
"this strategy game stays the king in this genre for a reason. once you take some time to understand its simple core mechanics, it becomes oh so dangerously addicting. i could blame this game for numerous wasted weekends and some nights with no sleep, but i cant. i had too much fun running my own little civilization experiments at increasing difficulty levels, and having so much fun. one peace of advice: a good pc is recommended, because the wait times between turns can get annoying, especially at the late game.",254.9
"the best turn based strategy game ive ever played, normallly im a c&c fan myself but ever since i played civilization: revolution, ive been addicted to the civ franchise. its useful if you want to go ahead and test youre strategic planning skills or if you just have alot of time on ur hands with not enough stuff to do :p i give it a 4.5 out of 5 (4.5 / 5)",776.5
"what can i say about this game that hasnt already been said? nothing. if you have played any of the past civilization games and enjoyed them, get this. i havent played since civ 2, but this did not disappoint. +depth +replayability (infinitely so) -poor ai relys on built in advantages to be competative. -ai doesnt handle water maps very well.",281.2
"one of my favourite game series, civv actually acomplishes what most of the series put out in terms of building an empire. there are numerous ways to win, and a few ways to survive. one of my favourite is just winning from the science method, while trying to get all countries to be peaceful is a pain, at least you can always backup your defense with science.",121.4
"perhaps one of my all time favorite games. whether it be peacefully gliding your way to victory or crumbling everyone in your path to global domination, its always a blast!",189.4
"i love everything about this game except how to long it takes to get achievements.",259.2
"one of the best turn-based strategy games. totally recomendded!",93.4
"this is my first civ game and let me just say that its made a great impression, me and my friend just havent stoped playing. dominating whole countries and having your whole empire crumble from one mistake. this game is a must have, the multiplayer is also a wonderful and fun time, just make sure you bring friends and a glass of water cause things can get stressful. 10/10",93.4
"you get addicted, but its a good addiction, and you should accept it",113.3
"this honestly has to be one of the best games ever written... middle aged mba educated widely read guy here, and i derive intense intellectual stimulation and learning from this game. sid meir is a genius. he just maps out how civilisations really work so well.",245.6
"the best turn-based strategy game ive ever played. takes forever to complete a game though.",275.2
"as the dlc has moved on, the game has improved. still think civ ii was the best, though...",124.2
"its an awsome game just a bummer that you have to buy all extations",77.9
"this game is amazing i love every bit it is so much fun but it can be hard to get to know the game but after that it is an amazing experience there is so much detail and so many choices to be made",78.3
"fantastic fun, you could spend hours playing it. inituive gameplay and tutorials to help you get started. the addition of famouse historical leaders also enhance the fun. at the moment im trying to recreate the great british empire! i highly reccommend !",35.3

"the only negative i can think of is how quickly you can get sucked in.",77.9
"every time i see it being played, or something reminds me of civilization, ive got to start playing again. and i generally do for a few weeks again, and its fun every single time. to me its the best iteration of the series so far, mostly because of one unit per tile, and i wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone",351.4
"i have to recommend this game because it is a really fun strategy game where you pick a civilization and win by science,culture, or world domination and every civilization has its own skills and downfalls, but i always will be in love with the french because it is in my culture!",92.7
"very addictive. i launched a rocket as the mongols in one game and got nuked by the mayans in the next one. then i downloaded a mod and curbstomped the greeks as a country led by akemi homura. none of that makes even the slightest bit of sense, but i love it. some high number/10, excellent game.",456.3
"pretty much any thing that has a sid meiers label on it, i love. the only problem i have with this game is that one dlc costs as much as the entire original game. i know i could buy the complete edition, but it hardly seems fair that i have to pay for the game twice just to get a decent deal on the dlc. you should think about pro-rating the prices of the dlc to match that of the complete edition (i.e. make the major dlc content 10 bucks each at most), especially considering that beyond earth just came out.",139.9

"in the 100+ hours ive thrown into this game, i can easily say that civ 5 is one of the most addicting strategy games ive ever played. its the turn-based aspect about it that hooks me, i think; i need to just finish this next turn and that turns into 100 or so. ive not been able to delve into absolutely everything yet, all the map types and civs would take probably months of play, or a few nights on a wiki. if youre into a good strategy game and you dont mind putting a lot of time into a match, its good fun.",114.4
"great game with a lot of content and diverse strategies. great for playing with friends. it is very time consuming.",563.2
"i havent been into civilization since civ 2, and i must say this one was much better than the last few. the diplomacy tends to work, and combat has been balanced out a bit (no stacking). although, whenever i put the difficult up to prince it seems like the competition has some serious advantages. i managed one prince level playthrough without getting my  handed to me (thanks siam). then again, i suck at civilization. i have never been good at the series, but i do enjoy it when i want a simple strategy game. love those giant death robots.",84.1

"awesome game. it kinda takes a while to get into but after that its really fun. it is sort of a one sided game though. only certain people will find it entertaining. basically you take control of a civilization and command it. you can train troop units and can research new things once you advance into the future. all up it is basically a fun history lesson.",11.5
"obviously a classic series that continues to improve with every release, but be warned: the ai is inherently bad and does not play better on higher difficulty settings. instead, the game simply assigns better starting resources and disposition to the computer opponents, making the game incredibly unfair in the beginning, only to level out and eventually fall in your favour towards the end. when i discovered this fact, i was compelled to stopplaying, but i still dont regret the nearly 400 hours i spent on it.",391.4

"from a background of playing the aoe series, the first time i played civ 5 demonstrated the vast differences between the two, though once you transition from the real-time aoe to turn based civ, you discover a game beautiful in its design, unique in its design and diverse in its range of civilisations to choose from (with its expansion packs adding additional great content). while it can be slow to progess at times, this gives more time to experience the game for all its worth. as with most steam games, the modding compatability adds another level to the game ensuring additional content into the future. like with most games, the ai is not perfect, though i feel civ 5 does it better than some. overall a great game that can be played for hours and still only break the surface of all its contents.",33.2

"civilization 5 is a turn-based strategy game where the player has to advance their faction to achieve victory . graphically changes little from their predecessors and the new system of hexagons areas does not bring anything new. the progression between ages is good and the factions are balanced . disappoints the political system that is a little boring, but its still playable. my vote is 7/10",57.0

"i love this game so much that i have literally played for three days straight through, only stopping to pee! didnt even bother to eat! i was too busy devouring anyone else who did not succumb to my will. playing as america is fun but boring. playing as russia and nuking america is priceless. omg the mushroom cloud, omg. how about world domination as the brazilians?! or austria destryoying germany while the brits are tied up with the zulus and the aztecs while the whole time mogolia is attacking and expanding everywhere like a disease killing anything in its path and all you can do now is hope that the barbarians dont take advantage of the fact that you were at war with every civilization and city state and take over your capital whilst dealing with a rebellion in the cities because half your cities were destroyed and everything pillaged........great times. 10/10",584.9

"turn based strategy and loads of fun :) do not expect to be playing for an hour or two.... this game will eat away days and nights for that matter. it is by far one of the best turn based strategy games out there. so many things to do, so many people to conquer!",277.3

"dont play with danny unless youre willing to go nuclear.",116.3
"i would highly reccomend this game to any intellgient hardcore gamer. it opened a world of strategy games to me, and i am so grateful for that. before this game i had never played rts or tbs gmaes, and this was accessible enough for me to undertsnad it, but complex enough to challenge me. and whiile it is not overwhelming, the better you get the more complex you can make the game so it doesnt get boring with exerience, this is a genius masterstroke of game making. i can say with complete confidence that this is by far the best turn based strategy game of all time, and it is in my top 5 strategy games, wich is impressive because every other strategy game in my top 10 is rts.",374.3

"this may not be the most in-depth review ive written, but its easy to rate this game. i would recommend this game to anyone who at any point in their life enjoyed playing any board game. buy this game as soon as you can and play it with a friend next to you as you build and rule your civilization!",44.4
"this game is amazing! it is for sure my favorite strategy game of all time! the options of what you want to do with your empire is unlimited, you can conquer the world with an iron fist or let the arts flourish among your people. some things i would want to change but nothing you cant fix with a mod or two. i would definitely recommend this game.",121.3
"youre damn right i recommend this game. it may seem silly with some of its cartoonish interactivity, but, once you get past that, it is one of the most addictive simplistic games ive ever enjoyed within the strategy genre. i play it for hours without even noticing such time has gone by, yet i dont feel my time wasted. i enjoy this game and i believe you will to.",191.0

"sid meiers civilation v is a very addicting turn-based game. once you start it keeps you busy for the next two hours at least, the multiplayer feature makes you play for hours on end with your friends. what i really like about this game are the plenty amount of characters and countries you can choose from, not only do you get to play as gandhi or queen elizabeth, but everyone has got their own perks so choose wisely. your opponent also has thier own personalities which makes the game more fun to play. also, this game does not only provide fun, but you can learn from it too. its not a simpel game either, it requires tactics and a lot of thought. the visuals are simply amazing.",24.2

"extremly time consuming game. really easy to get your moneys worth in game time. i have almost 300 hours in and have only (completed) one match. its a strategy game, but has lots of different aspects. it could be seen as more of a war strategy game, but its more than that. you have to manage your cities, your ecomonmy, diplomatic relations, religion, and technological advances. it takes a few hours to get into the game, but once you do it will be easy to get at least 100 hours out of it. 10/10",422.5

"the latest in the civilization series, this game takes the experience to a whole new level. hexs replace squares, allowing cities to expand and grow even bigger then before. while features have been removed from civilization 4, others have been added that give the game a new sense of balance, and more planning than ever is required to create a civilization to stand the test of time! a true must for the budding world leader.",561.9
"a veteran might prefer the earlier civs, but id say civ 5 is an awesome game. if youre new to civ games, i can definitely recommend this game. its even better with gods & kings and brave new world. if the singleplayer gets dull, the multiplayer is very much alive! one can also try mods!",121.8
"probably one of the most intricate and long going series i have had the pleasure to enjoy. from the start, the game may seem dull as a turn based strategy game, but in reality, as the game progresses, it shows that it has so much more to offer than another rock paper scissors strategy game. with elements such as international politics, a growing economy and a range of technological pursuits, the true value of this game lies in its replayability and potential gameplay styles. with that said, it can be a slow paced game, which isnt for everyone, though i have hardly had more fun with my friends over a few drinks. a fully reccomended game for anyone who likes strategy games, and more so if you enjoy watching the asension and decline of humanity through its many civilisations. -keon",134.4

"civ v is a really fun game because it is like alternate history and i like history. if you want to have a way more in depth experience of alternate history then check out one of paradoxs games. but if you want a simpler game, then civ v will be a fantastic game for you. :)",507.0

"all time favorite game, ive palyed for hundreds of hours always on huge and have yet to finish a game, but its about as perfect as a game has ever been to me. if you like strategy with actual diplomacy and trade, this game with all of its expansions accomplishes it.",425.1

"i think civ 5 is the best game ive ever played. on any console. period. which is a big ask when youre going up against killer instinct from the original gameboy...i digress. civ 5 is simply amazing. replayability is endless. the mechanics are flawless (well, probably. i couldnt think of a single way to improve it). the combat is exciting and the strategies are many and varied. its hands down the best turn-based strategy game ever, and even in its 5th installment still has new innovations that just improve on what was already a great series. i have sunk so many hours into this game, the only drawback is that you will have many sleepless nights and bleary mornings if you install this game. but if there ever was a game that justified sleepless nights and bleary mornings, then this is it.",499.0

"i was a little hesitant to play this at first as this isnt the type of game i usually pick up, but if anyone watches angry joe show, he wasnt lying. this game is amazing. ive invested 24+ hrs into it and am still in love with it. my only comment would be that as a girl, i do enjoy playing female characters and theyve included a handful but theres still a clearly disproportionate number of male characters. alas, this is likely due to the overwhelming amount of male leaders compared to female leaders in our history, but lets not get political. anyway, buy this game.",103.3
"great game, i was a bit sceptical of the new layout with the different paragons from civ: iv, but i have since grown accustomed to the hexagons instead of plain squares. the game itself is awesome, with both the leader/civ traits and the special units, you have a lot of different road to head down with your civ. you can choose to go all out agressive if you have strong earlygame units or are a good diplomat with the citystates. there isnt two games that are alike. the map changes, the opposing ai does, and the attitude of nearby city states (whom you either please or ignore) makes the game feel like a new experience each game",136.9

"cant get enougth of this game after my first 300 hours ofgameplay i still found new ways of having fun in it,good and huge amounts of content and very easy to learn but hard to win sometimes. the ai is not that bad as in tradicional strategy games and it actual makes the experience better when u have 5 civs going for a win all in diferents ways i love this game to much can get enought of it and i recomendet to everyone newcomer to the franchise or hardcore gamer srry for any english related error",910.3

"pretty boring. beginning eras are fun but only for a few miutes. before you know it its zipped into modern times. all late game units look the same. dull design. ai cheats. lazy programming. strange choices, such as you cant have a lumber mill in jungle or fish rivers. any difficulty level from normal ramps up incredibly quickly. ruins flow. it is strangely addictive though...like a scab you have to scratch. plus points are that it works perfectly and i have never had a crash, glitch or save game problem.",127.5
"this game is just amazing and the dlc makes the game even more enjoyable",90.3
"this is really an upgrade from the old versions. the complexity and multitudes in achieving victory combined with the different civilizational aspects provides an extreme diversity in each game. the multiplayer experience is really the pinnacle of what started as civnet. this game is truly enjoyable in the company of friends in multiplayer mode.",80.9

"civilization v had a lot of issues when it first launched, which resulted in that i dropped out of the game, because it wasnt any fun compared to the predecessor. when i picked up the game after it was on sale and my friend asked me if it was worth it, i immediately saw a lot of improvements. id reccomend this game if youre prepared to get the major dlcs (gods and kings and brave new world). the rest of the dlcs are just for fun :)",77.7
"if you can get your hands on this game with all expansions, by all means do it.",153.0
"now with gods and kings, the game has struck a great balance with level of complexity. why others miss the civ 4 stacks of doom is beyond me.",556.2
"once you pick up on all the game mechanics, it becomes a great and enjoyable way to pass the time. replayability is high due to the number of civilizations, game options, and random map generation, and playing with friends is very easy. i would definitely recommend buying at least the base game.",148.4

"8.7/10 im civ fan since civ 4. civilization v has a huge potential and its easy to get addicted to one more turn. in this game is always something to do, but play at big map after 100 turns can make gameplay slow :( ... so play in bigger maps req more fast cpu and better graphic card. civilization v is the revolution? rather not, but its one of best games of last years.",78.4
"get this when its on sale. but not stand alone 8/10",49.3
"i need only one reason to not recommend this game. i wasted 3 days playing (at least 15 hours) because i accidentally pressed the retire button on the menu when i opened it to save my game. the game said i abandoned my civilization but that they were not worried as i would some day return, and also it gave me 2 options, go to menu (or something on those lines) and no. one more turn, one more turn. i used the last option thinking it will not actually retire me, so i kept playing, saved the game, and after many our when i finally get the diplomacy victory (world leader) nothing happens. surfing the web i learned that confirmation technology is not available in this game due to its compliated nature, i mean are you sure you want to throw all this time you spent to the trash? of course! you dont need to confirm that. seriously, what the  firaxis?!",120.3

"after being gifted this particular game i was sceptical as to whether or not i would enjoy playing it, i do indeed enjoy strategy games but i also sometimes tire of them easily. i am also not one to read instructions, and for a complex game such as this i imagined it would hinder me at first if i didnt read about the mechanics. however, i decided to just dive in and see how well i could do to begin to understand how it functions, i havent played a lot of this game but i have played enough to understand how it works and how to role out different units. it is particularly fun and entertaining but borderline addictive - thus my recommendation is to buy this game unless you feel that you will fall into a time sink wherein the only light you will see is from the burning fire and destruction in the massacre of other civilizations you plunder and ruin in your wake.",84.5

"this game is great, but it can get addicting, so beware. the vannila game is good but not as good as the dlc game, its worth giving the dlc a try. one bad thing is with the vanilla game it lacks a lot of things i was used to in civ four, like stacking units, but this isnt really a huge problem, its adds to the game in a way. the replayabilty is huge, kinda like spore, and it is increased with the dlc. please get this game, it is epic! build an emipire to stand the test of time!",41.8

"simply put - the global leader in turn based strategy drastically improves on its previous efforts in the series. disappointed that religion doesnt come in the base game but comes in an extra dlc which i havent personally got yet. fantastic visuals and art, interesting snapshots of language and innovations to the series like 1 unit per tile really improve tactical gameplay.",35.7
"i have bought every civilization game ever made, i love this game and i still do, but i dont appreciate loosing my option to play the game without being connected & being forced to do so while paying full price. this is in my opinion a betrayal by the franchise i have grow to love over the years. i will not purchase another game. though i think this is a fantastic platform it is not how i personally like to handle my business. i dont want anyone to know what im doing at any given moment if i choose not to tell them. this is my right to have privacy any i feel kinda violated.",102.3

"amazing game with tons and tons of fresh and entertaining content. though the game is heavly, heavly improved by dlc. if your low on many brave new world is the for your interest. with an active modding community and so much content for such a small price during steam sales, its a great experience! vanilla civ 5: 7 out of 10 civ 5 with dlc: 9.5 out of 10 :{a must have for stradegy game fans}:",222.5
"decided to purchase civ on sale after reading an article that placed it in the top 10 pc games you have to play. if you want a game with complex systems, 0 explaination but strangely addictive, this is the game for you. i find it extremely boring, but just played for 5 hours.",7.7

"just one more turn, one more campaign i swear... (6 hours later). not recommended for low-end computers, as late-game turn processing can make the game lag and heat up your computer. definitely play dx11 mode if you can handle it though, its much prettier to look at and you get animated world leaders.",221.5

"of course civ 5 is a great game... im just not convinced that the expansion is worth the cost. the price is quite high for what seems to be such a small amount of content; and the things theyve removed or tweaked entirely annoy me (good-bye culture bombs). i suppose a lot of the changes happened for game balance, but to change game fundamentals that long after release? a little sloppy for me. still, over-all, its a great game - id just wait for a goty edition, or for gods & kings to drop in price.",654.9
"a really freakin funny game! it is really fun to conquer cities, and wreck the enemy! really good mods aswell, for example you can play as the pc god gabe newell, or the imperials from skyrim in tamriel!! it has this only 1 more turn addiction to it, making you sit up all night playing it! you should really buy this if you like stratigy games! i will give it an 10/10 would buy again what are you waiting for? buy it now!",49.9

"just...one...more...turn... is what youll say when you play this game. one more turn as your cities grow and expand across the continent. one more turn as your armies march across the land, sea, and air to destroy your enemies. one more turn as your empire becomes the leading power and you sit back and marvel at your creation. this is truely an awesome game. if you are interested in empire building strategy, you wll spend many hours on this game. each match can last hours, and that is still when the game speed is set to fast. it is easy for beginners to pick up and play; there is a very basic tutorial difficulty to teach you the various mechanics of the game, your advisors will be there every step of the way to offer you strategic input, and the in game encyclopedia (named civilopedia) is there to expand your knowledge on individual aspects of the game and even teach you some history!",193.3

"an amazing turn based stratagy game with a huge amount of gamechanging decisions to make, expecially with all the dlc which i highly recomend. the only thing i dont like is how even now there is still a few bugs left in muliplayer including the trading bug which can completly wreak the game for you. but this only a small isue and means nothing if you are playing with trusted freinds. over all the game is great fun expecially with freinds and provides hours of fun. 10 out of 10",502.9

"ive been playing this game for like 15 hours now, its actually pretty fun! at first i was like whoa dude everyone is so addicted to this game called civ 5 and thought psshh they probably exaggerating. but then i tried it out myself, theres a lot of stuff to learn about it at first but once you learn all that in like an hour or two. its all set sail from there. it really reminds me of playing age of empires and red alert 1 back in the day. brings back nostalgic memories. this game is very deep like miley cyruss . you can easily sink in many many hours into it. i would definitely rate this game a 9.5/10. its like miley cyrus, great visuals and very deep.",38.2
"i mean, its civilization. if youve played one before, you know the general gist of things. i will say that i enjoy the move to hextiles over the squares previously seen, and i actually like some of the more controversial changes, such as not being able to stack an infinite number of units into a single tile. since i tend to play more for non-militaristic victories, the changes in civ v have, for the most part, not been things i have issues with. if youre into conquest as your main mode of play, maybe not for you. but if you mostly play a balanced game or go for a non-violent path, then i think youll enjoy the upgrade. make sure you pick it up with the two expansion packs, as it adds an enjoyable depth with trade, religion and culture without adding too much complexity.",124.3

"i played this game when it was free but put in 6 hours strait and i loved every freaking second of it. never thought id be into these kinds of games being an fps kind of person, but theres something about this game that makes me so happy. maybe its the idea that you can make your own kind of history through your decisions, maybe im a power monger idk. playing with friends is even better, remeber when we made our alliance and stopped the war between quebec and rio? you can have your own loar and history with friends to reminis on or even build your next game off of. all around enjoyable game and i cant wait until the christmas sale to buy it and spend days of my life playing this game. 12/10 freakn amazballs!",65.1

"why havent you bought civilization v yet? you have? well, its time to kill that  ghandi once and for all! play for countless hours by yourself or with friends! you can even play senarios like the civil war. its too overwelming? get to know the game by playing the standard game without the dlc then once you get farmiliar with it, upgrade. 10/10, would civ v again.",132.6

"the first time i played this, i thought it was extremely boring. a turn based strategy game? come on. ive always played other games such as starcraft for my rts fix because of the speed at which you play. but after coming back and forcing myself to sit down and play it, i found that while the games do go for a long time and i do like a quick win, this game is really good and really detailed. a single match on the smaller maps can take a couple of hours on their own but theres so much you can do that the game feels fresh at every step along the way. i make sure to turn off combat animations and movement animations though, just to make it that slight bit faster.",25.9

"ive never been much of a strategy game person, but this and xcom: enemy unknown really changed that. this game is a little rough around the edges without the brave new world and gods & kings expansions. i highly recommend both of those to get an extremely complete and well rounded game. as the saying goes: one more turn. as you can see i have spent well over 700 hours on this game and i have enjoyed almost every moment of it. i always seems to fall back into and and just enjoy the game play. the game also has a very good amount of history you can learn from in just by reading the built-in wiki. i have since taken up an interest in history, just due to this game. there are just so many things i can write about this game, but i think the best thing i can really say is you should try it for yourself. i am sure you will enjoy it, especially if you are already into strategy games!",813.1

"to try and keep this brief, civilization five in one of the most refined strategy games on the market. the fact that even recently the game is still recieving both offical expansions, and user content should be a testament to that alone. building on the framework of pervious titles, and reworking nearly every aspect into a more streamlined approach might have back fired. yet, it still remains addicting and fun even after the years it has been released.",241.2
"this is an epic stratagy game that will keep you sucked in with its epic music to go along with each civilization, and im talking like 4 hrs straight of playing.it has plenty of gameplay and also has tons of mods on the steam workshop.the dlcs for this game are also worth the money adding in serveral civilizations, senarios and houndreds of hours of gameplay. i love this game so much!",676.4

"i like this game but for some reason it crashes a lot. if anyone can help me figure out why that would be splendid.",5.2
"do you like civilizations?! do you like warfare?! do you like firing nukes without repercussions?! if you answered yes to any of the above, read on. if not... read on anyway. i might be able to persuade you. civilization v is nothing like the previous incarnations of the series. except for the overall gameplay, most of the features have changed. leaders have been done away with, and all nations have only one leader. religion has been greatly expanded upon with the gods & kings expansion, and theres a new world congress feature to replace the un in brave new world. that being said, while this is a great game by itself, the unpatched version without the dlc and expansionpacks is inferior to civilization iv in terms of content. if youre planning to pick this up, get it with the dlc or at the very least the expansions. it should give you, at the veyr least, a few hours of amusement.",126.7

"what are you doing reading this review, you should be buying civilization 5 and all of its game changing expansions! if you dont know what civilization is then you are sad on such a deep level. but, let me show you the light to lead you out of your ignorant ways. this game is the most beautiful piece of strategy than man kind has created so far. you take your group of loyal but hopelessly stupid and simple cavemen throughout the ages and eventually into the future were you drop nuclear warheads, barter for the fate of the world, and host the most splenderous wonders the world has seen in your civilization. see what i did there, i put the name of the game in the description. go ahead, buy it. if you feel that all this seems overly complicated or grandeous, then you are correct and if you turn away from the game because of that, then you are as simple as the cavemen described above.",353.8

"having been a civ addict since the original civilization release over 20 years ago i was initially disappointed with this release as the game did not appear to have the depth of other civ games, particularly civ 4. however the more i played this it became apparent that the game dynamics were far more intricate than i first percieved, offering challenges for both beginners and civ veterans. with 2 well planned expansions adding a level of depth that rivals, if not superceeding civ 4, i now rate this game as the best in the series. with nearly a 1000 hours of gameplay, ive probably invested more time in this game than any other game in my collection and it still offers exceptional replay value on the higher difficulty levels. i cant recommend this game highly enough, quite simply it is astounding!",1035.9

"if you like age of empires and turn based games. i totally reccomend this game.",0.5
"456 hrs played, all single player. this is the best refined civ game ive played. this versions ui is the best by far. it is a great game to pass some time and build an empire. the main weakness of civ v is the ai. none of them follow the personality of their historical counterparts. they all have basically the same personality: psychopath. nothing like having ghandi break an alliance and declare war on you. but all in all, its a game i have played a lot and continue to come back to.",622.5
"amazing game, extremely fun specially with friends. only glitch that bothers me is the multiplayer modify and accept without other person receiving counter-offer glitch. 9.9/10 because of said glitch.",421.8
"this game is one of the best games that i have played. i deffinately reccomend it especially if you love stratigy. i love to play this because i love stratigy (without stratigy i would be a mindless thug playing call of duty no offence). me and my friend think it would be the perfect game to play for geography in school because it has some geological stuff in it (dont steal this idea or unless you put my name in for example thank you ethan/behemoth for suggesting this). deffinately play it and maybe even challenge me if you dare and yea. recap deffinately play it challenge me if you want and watch my youtube (soon going to be uploading civilizations once i fix my recorder)",32.1
"amazing game endless possiblities and if you get bored theres always fun mods",845.4
"i didnt think id like this game. id tried another civ game before and it hadnt been my taste of thing. i tried this and it just works. there are so many options to work with for shaping your nation, and (with a little imagination) you can create victory conditions for yourself. it is a good game to play and is very worth your time.",161.5
"people are always saying that this game is only good with the expansions. that is true, so while this game is good {with expansion} are you really willing to pay an extra 30 bucks to make this game good {in other words, the game is technically 60 bucks for a 3 year old game}.",42.5
"fantastic game, combining strategy, histry, and tonnes of fun. instant classic with beautiful visuals.",37.8

"what can i say about sid meiers civilization v? it is seriously one of my favourite games to date. it is an amazing turn-based strategy, that does not feel like either genre! you slowly build up your empire untill your number one, or you get left behind, choose one of the multiple ways to win, whether its world domination or the magnificent space race. i feel like anyone could play this game with or without your friends and still have a great time. wait did i say with your friends? yup it has multiplayer. as you are building your civilization why not invite your buddy? where both of you get to compete with your friends to see who is the better conquerer! i hate turn based games, but this is great game that everyone can enjoy! p.s. and remember, dont trust ghandi :p",15.8
"addictive, replayable, fun and great to play with friends... easily becoming one of my fast favorites",77.9
"if you enjoy any turn based strategy games then look no further! for those who played past civ games, you may be dissapointed by some of the new features. civ 5 does a good job introducing new players so the seies, which could be a neggetive affect on civ veterans. all in all, great game.",60.6
"a fun timbased gamee about ruling empieres deffintly worth my money",39.3
"this game is like crack!!! you just tell yourselfone more turn, just one more turn and then you realize that your in the future just like you are in the game!",61.5
"easily recommend this game and a must for anyone who enjoys strategy games. not a steep learning curve, very easy to get into it and learn the game, but there is a lot of more in depth things which give a lot more control, like manual citizen management. love this game, definitely one of my favourites.",205.1
"you start a game. ill play for about an hour, then go do something else. then you start you empire, you research mining, horseback riding, all that good stuff. you found another city or two, and make allies with russia and germany. you notice an hour has passed, but youre just about to finish building the pyramids. ill just play another turn or two. the moment you finish the pyramids, russia denounces you for finishing them right before she did. maybe ill play for a few more turns, just to see how this plays out. and before you know it, its 3 am, you havent eaten in 12 hours, and nothing you wanted to do today gets done. ty sid meier. bump.",85.2

"dispite the fact of war being a little to server punishement (i dont mind my people mad just i am disappointed that if you go to war every one but you allies and friends will want you 6 feet under) this is a intensly fun game and it is much more intese with mods because, you dont have a clue what to expect. if you want most of the workshop addons though you need g&k and brave new world dlcs but you will still have fun vinilla style.",201.9
"wasnt convinced at first but was soon dragged in. engrossing. time flies. 93 hours so far and into my longest game at about 1200 turns. five stars.",424.1
"been playing civ since number 2 and it keeps changing everything but the spirit of slow determined conquest. i love it",451.5
"this is the best version of civiization!! give it a try and youll like it.",49.9
"this game is brilliant. the problem with turn based games is that they can get a bit dull if done poorly. civ 5 does a great job, really only with bnw (brave new world), which is not a point in its favor. however even without bnw this game has enough tension in combat to keep me hooked.",492.3
"better combat system than civ 4, more wonders. miss the ww2 scenario though! the hexagon grid system makes it possible to form a proper defensive line and through holding strategic positions it is possible to hold of a larger army. the culture part of the game is also better than than ever. with tourism points you have to manage your production of great works in order to get combo points, adding more management to the game.",197.8
"awesome game. beware though this game will suck away your life...",176.2
"just like in real life, people in this game hate me for no disernable reason! 9th grade all over again! except throwing spears instead acusations and supicions about my sexual oriantation. 10/10 great low self esteem simulator",268.9
"love this game. 500+ houres loged. single player is fun but i would recomend getting a bunch of your friends together every once and a while on ts or steam chat and go at it for a while. beware however that this game will test those friendships!!",652.9
"civilization v is in all honesty, the best game i have ever had the pleasure of playing. its not just how much time the developers have put into making this game as good as possible, its also how much the community has helped the game thrive and become more of a player friendly experience. although if you want to buy it, i strongly recommend getting bnw and gk (brave new world and gods and kings) as they improve the game mechanics greatly. the community as a whole makes this game worth while, mods improve the game greatly even in places where you thought there could be no improvement. 11/10 strongly recommend it.",299.0
"it could be an excellent game if the multiplayer problems were not so annoying. even in lan we have lag and disconnection. it brings nothing but frustration, and thats really sad because the game is great in single player but could be even greater in multiplayer. for what this game gave me i cant recommand it.",32.7
"truly a classic, normally a series would have shown signs of slowing down or stagnating in terms of content or quality but the civ series is still going strong.",404.3
"whats not to like about civilization v? the title that was famous for one more turn is once again back with a vengeance. the new fully rendered leader speech and full facial animation depending on your nations relationship is only the icing on the cake. there are a lot more improvements being introduced in this latest installment. the one i enjoyed the most is the new grid introduction. this made combat feels a bit more strategic as you have more room to manuever and at the same time attacked. if you still have not purchased this game yet, i strongly recommend it. just make sure you leave 72 hours of your time free.",178.2
"this is a spectacular and deep strategy game for those of you with a couple (read: a ton) of hours to spare. its various map generation settings, well-functioning hotseat and online multiplayer modes, plethora of unique and interesting civilzations to play as, and varying routes to victory will keep one entertained for hundreds upon hundreds of turns. one note- the complete edition is a must-buy. gods and kings and brave new world are instrumental to having the best civ experience, as they add awesome features and necessary balance, improving the game greatly.",460.3
"fight as much as you like, losers. im going to mars.",81.0
"i dont have much to add to the conversation that other people have not said already; if you like previous civ games, then youll probably love this one, too. there are some interesting gameplay changes, for better or worse, such as changes in naval games. in previous games, i always found building ships then loading those ships to be tedious, but this rendition makes that much less tedious by not needing cargo ships.",10.4
"if you hate seeing the outside of your room and want ghandi to ing kill your  with nukes and tanks this is the game for you",184.6
"i have played all the civilizations even the one at play station this civilization is the worst it they developed new characteristics that was less enjoyable it wasnt as enjoyable as the rest civs. 3/10",38.2
"great depth of play. i still dont know what im doing.",140.7
"as a long time player of the civilization series i was impressed by this addition. this is a big step up from their last game and a truly great game to start the series on.",223.2
"if you havent bought this game you dont know mindbending challenge beyond comprhension in a turn base strategy if you have its excessively great right.",62.6
"a beautifully well-made, turned-based strategy game, civilization v will capture and enthrall you for hours on end. even for someone like myself who has never played another civilization game before, this game had me addicted about 10 minutes into it and ive played for several hours nonstop, only stopping for real-life necessities. you create your own world, own maps, own cultures, all from scrap and then try to see and make them rise to greatness. i cannot implore you enough to acquire this game. note at 7/14/13: some people on tf2op are selling it for 2 keys so dont miss this oppotunity to pick it up! you will not be disappointed if you love creative, strategic games of any kind. this is a top-notch 9/10 game or higher easily.",6.9
"ive always been a fan of the civ games, so i was of course excited to get back into them with this edition. its great for passing time and fans of casual and turn based games. give it a try",4.5

"currently burning the cybermens cities to the ground and plundering their cyborg technologies to further enhance the tech level of tokyo-3 9/10 the fact that i spent days on this game scares me",248.4
"one of the best strategy games out there. graphics are quite nice and you really do feel like the master of a nation as you tweak and fine tune your civilization according to your strategy. the base game however is a little bland and although it looks much nicer than civ 4 it has been dumbed down. overall, worth picking up if you want a good game.",403.2
"i always end up staying up until it gets bright out bc of this game.  you sid meier.",86.7
"great game, would definitely recommend it. only downfall is that it is waaaay too addictive.",206.0
"this is definitley one of the best strategy games ive ever played. and the fact that its modable just makes it so much better. i might be new to civ but if you love strategy, get this game. its worth every cent. although if you want (cuz its pretty expensive with the expansion packs) then wait until there is a sale. then you can buy the gold edition. having an expansion pack adds so much to the gameplay. either wait or buy now, but once you do buy it, well, enjoy!",147.4
"why does this game take so long to do things, it is just a map",29.5
"a very relaxing game to play, once those achievements start racking up it becomes very addictive. the multiplayer takes the game to a whole new level as well either playing against friends or on the same team.",892.7
"amazzing game and good as sid meiers game always 5/5 would play again",69.4
"a great turn base game with many different civilizations to choose from. you will spend hours and hours on just one game. its endless fun that will never end. make sure to have a good strategy though.",28.2
"one of the only games i cant stop playing! addicting and frustrating! one of the most strategic games you will ever play and one you will either feel accomplished or regretful by the end. a great buy 9/10.",321.3
"i played civ ii when i was a 13 years old child, and i still remember these long, sometimes even overnight sessions ;). i skipped civ iii and iv, as i was always feeling of it being the same than before, but then i found civ v on steam winter sale and bought it. and it still feels like in my memories. so one might say that there wasnt much innovation, but when civ wasnt played a long time ago or civ hasnt been played at all this feeling of growing a nation and becoming more and more powerful is still great. and still it produces the same one more round feeling as always before. personally i recommend civ v to everyone who hasnt played civ at all or where it has been a while. for the ones who played iii and iv i have the feeling that its still the same.",16.0
"once you understand all the ins and outs, it can be quite humorous.",39.9
"brave new world expansion just made this game even better. ever wanted to play and take part in a subtle satire towards western worlds policy of subtle collonisation? finally i can be a coward and hide behind trade sanctions and luxuary bannings. starving millions and salting the earth of my enemies take that darius!",293.7
"i say, playing as oda nobunaga and getting george cromwell born in the land of the rising sun really made me smile. and gandhi nuked osaka twice.",2.3

"it is fun unless you playing against ing germany. ps dont buy on steam its 50$ less at eb games",96.9
"my sleep cycle has never been the same after a good dose of civ v. multiplayer is a bit heavy to play with constant lag issues.",136.5
"i dont know about the first release of this game and the problems it had. i didnt play it at the time because my computer was not able to run it properly. however, after a few patches and dlcs i must say that this is the best civilization ever, and i played them all ! the interface is a masterpiece. it truly hides the incredible layers of complexity that are behind this game. if you played other civ games you know how painful and repetitive some tasks were. not anymore. on the negative side, as always, diplomacy. it is still very simplistic. wars should have a casus belli and relationships (friends becoming enemies and viceversa) should be better managed. a diplomacy model like the one used in paradox games would be very welcome.",180.2
"i came. i saw. i got crushed when ghandi turned on me game of the year? no. its the game of the universe from the dawn of real civilization to today",53.4

"game of the year. game of all years. this is the half-life 3 of strategy games.",421.7
"sid meiers civilization v is a slightly complex turn based strategy game that can be enjoyed by all gamers. a fun and interactive map allows players to manipulate their surroundings in order to achieve their goal. teaming up with friends in order to dominate enemy civilizations is a remarkably enjoyable experience.",39.9

"one more turn....one more....another!.....just one more!......please help!......one....more...turn...",187.3
"awesome strategy game, one of the best ive played so far. first, when i entered the game, i was quite confused with bunch of options, but after a while, things had more sense. the game was made perfectly, with no errors at all, for both, singleplayer and multiplayer. battles, science, culture, wonders, religions, maps, characters, bonuses, expansions, all of them are harmonized magnificently. playing with friends is exciting, 6 hours marathon escalates quickly. at the end, just one more info, ive been playing civ5 for almost 7 months and even now, i feel no boredom while playing :) 10/10",160.1
"after buying this game, im finally happy. you want happiness? buy this game. dont look at the price, dont look at other reviews, dont look at anything...just buy it.",119.4

"this game takes hours before you can finish the whole thing as one person. there are more than one leader you can pick from. this game is fun overall!!!!",19.5
"flawless strategy game (except the ai, it makes your head hurt). 10/10 would play one more turn.",100.9
"do you wish hours moved like seconds? hate your job, but too scared to quit? dont worry- youll be missing time and no-showing at your place of employment with minimal effort, thanks to civilization v.",5.3
"an amazing game. i could just play this game all night, turn after turn. it is also very educational. i new 4 of the questions on my last history test because of this games civilizations and wonders. the strategy is flawless.",73.7
"like civ 4 but different. still has tanks and nukes, and the computer is still insane. but its basically the same game.",576.7
"gandhi threatend to nuke me if i didnt recommend this game",368.0

"allows me to let go of my anger through killing things",21.4
"epic good game, mp is kinda nightmare tho specially with random guys who keep quiting",560.4
"when i first got the game i thought i would not like it but after playing it i changed my mind. there is a lot of differant types of win you could go for & there is a lot of choice for the maps this games is fun even if you are not playing with friends. there is a lot of startegy to the game & everything depends on your happyness & luxary resources to trade either to make more money or improve relations with other civs",69.8
"solid game, especially with the new gods & kings pack.",36.5
"great game , turn based so low stress, build an empire",743.8

"11/10. one of the best games ive ever played, sid meier again makes a fabulous game. smooth gameplay and infinite replay value make it top notch! with more than a dozen awesome civs, and dlc that is very much worth the purchase, its a game i asbolutely love. cant wait for civilization: beyond earth!",281.1
"help me i cant stop!!!! other then the fact that its one of the most addicting games out there it also has some very good dlc that adds a lot of variety if you have the extra money.",108.1
"ghandi seemed like a nice guy, then he nuked my cities and unleashed giant death robots onto them. 69/10 would get rekt again.",51.7
"a worthy sequel to sid meiers epic game saga. the only short-coming is its lack of some specialized features (espionage, religions, political variety, ...) compared to civ iv & expansions, but im sure firaxis will sooner or later provide such through dlc or civ v expansions.",458.0
"your average civ game. gandhi has completed the manhattan project! quit game without saving. exit civ 5. exit steam. delete civ 5. delete steam. shut down computer. punch the screen in. break the computer with a hammer. throw the computer out of the window. burn the computer with a flamethrower. dance on the ashes naked. buy a plane ticket to india. go to a missile silo. launch a nuke. leave india. watch and laugh as the rest of the world pulverizes gandhis smug  face with nukes. kill yourself. alexander has won a diplomatic victory! come back to life. kill yourself again.",328.7

"exterminate, expand, explore,ad exploit your way through history either be a ruthless warmonger ripping his way through the centuries as an immortal god, or sit back relax and lie you heart out in diplomatic means but if you dont want to do either of those there always is the last opiton be the next newton or einstein and completley out science everyone while your people are totting automatic weapons watcha s the opposing masses flee in terror occasionaly throwing a stone however you want you got it",100.7
"great game you start playing at four look at your clock a little later and its alreadt ten",36.4
"pretty good but expensive game though its actually worth it when you buy the game as the game itself is pretty epic with its features though i recommend buying all of its dlcs as they make the game more fun and it will literally take a whole day when starting from the primitive era to the future era. 8.5/10",345.4
"one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever played a must have if you play pc games",34.8
"one last turn! fans of the civlization franchise have been screaming since the series inception and civ v is no exception. with many mechanics being overhauled and refined, every bit of the game is even better than the predecessor. fan or not you must check out this game, for it will consume your life (in the best way possible of course).",24.6
"if you are a fan of empire builders, or have been addicted to civ in the past - this is a fine rendition of the series. just keep in mind, they are looking to change a bit from previous games, and there are some shockers - like the removal of stacking units - that can be a blow to peoples strategy. still a well done game that even plays good on the mac - just update to snow leopard first (or it wont run).",51.8
"this game has destroyed my social life and caused my friends to alienate me. 10/10",175.4
"at first i was a bit alienated after playing the 4th game for so long, but after a time it grew on me and with the gods and kings expansion it ended up being definitly the best game in the serie so far.",433.0
"one more turn.... just one more turn... just one more-- oh, whats that? ive been here for four hours? oh well, im already running late, just one more turn shouldnt hurt... and maybe one more after that...",68.3
"i always wonder why i ever played this game. then, i realized that it is played en masse because that is the games nature- to have you waste an entire day trying to better ais in a cpu generated world. is this my reason, i cannot say. but i can say that it is worth a hundred hours of gameplay.",210.9
"deep down, its really not a different game from the pixelly dos one i used to play late into the night, very badly, way back when. still simple enough for a kid with plenty of depth, a decent learning curve and enough variety to keep you entertained for years. the multiplayer definitely needs some work, still buggy and cant be modded, but single player still has plenty of depth to go around.",245.3
"i dont know if you know this but im giving this game a good review show you should feel good.",160.4
"just 5 more turns... just a few more turns. just one more turn. alright, ill finish this research then im done for the night. just one more turn. ok, i really should stop... after this turn. ill save and ill close the game - after this turn. its 6am and im still playing, after this turn i should probably go to sleep... ive lost control of my life im ed.",116.3
"this installment of the civilization franchise has the best gameplay you will find in any civilization game. guiding an empire from fledgling tribal city into world spanning empire is amazing, and does not get stale, even over many iterations of founding and building nations. excellent graphics help add to the game, and the fact that leonard nimoy does loads of voicework in the game is great. overall, highly recommend the game and the expansion packs for it, including gods & kings, and brave new world, which add new civilizations, scenarios, and units that keep the game interesting.",355.6
"its good, not as good as gal civ 2, but very close, though dislike how i cant see the 3d of the unit till i build it. get this and gal civ 2 :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :( :( 8 of 10 stars",66.6

"i lost 4 hours in what seemed to be 15 minutes, what else can i say.",15.4
"for friends of turn-based stategy games very recommended. it wont get bored and is even for players with less experience and time.",1033.6
"great game. but it feels like committing a crime to recommend this deadly addictive game to anyone. thus i will.",102.8
"very good game. good value for the price. i have been playing several full games with different starting civilizations, trying new tactics each time. each type of victory is a goal to achieve in itself and some can be harder to achieve than others. the ais are not super smart, but can still be provide a challenge sometime.",66.9
"a really good game, especially for a returning civ fan. the more people you have with you, the better!",31.9
"the single player is weak, with less expansion and over all intelligence then previous civ titles. but the multiplayer is reasonably well put together. the game could handle some optimizing to run smoother, but overall its a fun title that adds a lot of new features to the series. get the full pack on a sale if you plan to buy it, its not worth the price of buying all the dlc seperately.",232.8
"too epic to stand not buying. you must buy this. also, you must buy the brave new world expansion. dont get gods and kings. bnw basically has the exact same stuff but better as g&k. buy now!",356.2

"very awesome game , the gameplay is fantastic , must buy this! its very fun",11.2
"this is one of my favorite games of all time and i reccomend it top everyone who is even slightly intrested in strategy games",372.9
"after putting in over 100 hours into this game, i can unequivocally say it is not as good as civilization iv and sid should be embarassed the way he has fallen into putting out a half finished game and then over charging for expansions to add what should have been in the original release all along. not to mention the ill concieved combat changes and so forth.",110.2
"one of those games that you will look at the clock and realize its 3am, and youve been playing for 7 hours straight.",110.9
"this is a phenomenal game for any ability. when i first started i wasnt the greatest and now i have progressed and am alright. it is an incredible single playe game and is equally as good multiplayer seriously recommend this but its nowhere near as good without bnw.",312.5

"much inculding within the game i still play it today.",97.6
"very disapointed steamwork shop is not supported with the mac.",204.3
"civilization v is must have game for people who enjoy strategy games. this game has combinations that will fit any person playing style. the basic things for this game are easy to learn. as you learn the more advanced items, your style will form to it and allow you to us it to the best of your abilities. for those who really like the past cilization games, you will like this one as well. and dont forget about the expandes, they take the gameplay to a whole new level.",284.8

"one of the best strategy games ive played, challenging and fun, but be ready for very long games",133.3
"this version of civ is not as complex as its predecessors, but that is more than compensated for by the much more balanced gameplay that requires you to have a well-rounded empire. the ability of cities to defend themselves also rewards players who play defensively and constuct walls and other defensive buildings. the social policy system also adds a new dimension to the game that was missing earlier, requiring you to choose from a variety of options that offer rewards tailored to different strategies and scenarios. and of course, civ5 is just as addicting as all the other games and will keep you coming back for more.",235.0

"brilliant game, cant stop playing siince i brought it and just love being able to play it with all my mates :d",155.8
"its really strange that this game and civ iv are such different titles. the fundamentals are all there, but itll be a bit of a learning process comming to civ v over from civ iv. its still just as addicted as iv, but the aforementioned is something to keep in mind.",2.1
"its really good. edit: after rolling over too many hours playing this... and i still dont have the latest expansion... its still really good.",650.9
"amazing game if you want to do a world domination game with friends or a.i.",76.6

"it is a very fun game, but unfortunaly after i downloaded every possible dlc, the bombing animations (including nukes) have disappeared and no one seems to have an answer for it. so, i am going back to total war, where i can at least get a strong community and learn how to fix issues.",327.6
"this is a game about time. not time travel, but time as a currency. because trust me, the money you spend on this game is not the full price. it is a down payment. the real price is the sheer amount of time you will spend playing it. a single game will take you all day. this game is a time vampire. play at your own risk. oh, and you build cities on landmasses and fight wars and stuff. or something.",138.3
"i love this game. can spend hours on end playing it",348.4
"i got this game 4 days ago and i cant stop playing it! 10/10",290.8
"today is civ 5 the best turn-based strategy on the market. especially when you have both major dlcs - gods & kings and brave new world. it has literally everything - epic battles, diplomatic schemes, spying, relgious conflicts, exploring never the same maps and the right feeling that you are the real emperor leading your nation to the greatness.",428.6
"get this if you want to waste 5+ hours in just one game :-)",446.2
"definitely not a game you should start up when you have something important scheduled. you know, like... sleeping or eating. the just one more turn syndrome will keep ordinary things like these well out of your mind. try the marathon mode if you dare... the multiplayer mode used to be bit wonky but it pretty stable after the last patches. definitely get both expansions for the best experience (the complete edition is usually up for 10 bucks during the steam sales).",683.1
"if ive wasted 400 hours of my life on this game, you know its good.",415.0
"this game is a masterpiece. civilization v is just a great game which includes many great historical civilizations and their armies. this game is really strategic. anyone playing with friends will have a really good time.",67.1

"the best stratagy game i have played highly recomend to all",29.5

"i once touched the butt of a 36 year old woman on a metropolitan subway headed to work on a monday morning. it was dark, gloomy infact; reminesant of most fall days when the trees wither off and the once happy plants die to live another day. the sun was just peaking over the horizon of the city scape and i could see the last remainders of a nights rest going to waste as the work ethic would pick back up again right where it left off. she was good looking, didnt look a day past 24. nice glasses and a  that even your mom wouldnt mind talking about. this one, was the one. now of coarse i couldnt just get up and walts over there like a sailor on the sea deck preparing to finally come home. i had to find a way to blend it, and not raise any alarms of the fellow dweary eyes around me. finess my way to the perfect platter that was awaiting my hungry arrival.... blah blah buy this game im tired of writing.",36.9
"a cursor would greatly improve game play (and keep me from being a curser) i had no idea where the mouse was which made clicking on buttons for game play near impossible. other than that graphics are good and game play is much like prior civ games.",15.7
"dont have a single dlc for it and it is by far one the best games ive ever played! easly in the top 5, the ai is a bit weird, like gahndi once he completes the manhattin project just spawns nukes everywhere, but realy thats no reason not to buy this marvel of computer gaming, because the real reson to buy this is for the multiplayer. if you even consider buying a grand paradox game buy this now!",135.2
"civ 5 is a smooth, turn-based strategy game about building your empire from the ground up. along the way youll face invading barbarians and other nations, some will help you, some will harm you. i highly reccomend this game, but get all the main dlc, without them the game is pretty trash. 10/10",314.4
"want a game that will keep you busy for hours, maybe not fun but certainly keep you busy... buy this game. wont say its my fav. of the civ series, but its not bad. my issue is with the expansion packs; you pay a lot of money and it never feels like you get much overall for that money. this is one of those cases while the game id buy if want it, id hang about for a sale on the expansions, especially brave new world as thats often more expensive then the actual game. :-/",101.1

"probably the best modern turn-based strategy game. interesting and enjoyable. 8/10",68.4

"great game, with in depth gameplay and multiple ways to win, so plenty of replayability.",7.7
"this game is great, i didnt play the game vanilla much, but with a few dlcs, the game was all i could ask for. single player would satisfy you forever, but multiplayer makes it that much better. fighting or teaming up with you friends can conquer the entire world.",100.2

"another civilization. quality strategy game, but yeah, its still much of the same thing so if youre burnt out on the typical civ-take-over-the-world gameplay, you may want to try something different. its been a few years since i played a civ game so i dont know if this was implemented in civ4 and i dont remember it, but i really like the new mechanics for religion and diplomacy. espionage too is much more fair. i bought the gold edition so i get to play as a civilization that is sometimes shunned -- the vikings! another terrific civilization. if you played the older verisons, youll learn quickly. if youve never played civilization, youre missing out. maybe the best turn-based strategy series ever designed exclusively for the pc?",230.0
"super fun and awesome. had some good times playing by myself for the first 60 hours, afterwards the gameplay became boring. loaded it up with some friends and had a blast, so the multiplayer is great! would recommend. warning: very long play sessions, you will have a lot of trouble finding a good break point.",100.1
"civ 5 has a moderately steep learning curve, but once you learn the basics, this game will entertain and challenge you like none other. biggest downside is that the ai cant really handle itself in military conflicts against a human.",997.7

"amazing game. not only does civ v rise up to the expectations of series, it exceeeds them.while the army stacking may be a small flaw, other features including simplified diplomacy and improved interface make the issue almost non-existant. if you played a perivous issue of the series or are a fan of strategy in any sort, pick up a copy of this game asap.",216.2

"great! this game makes me want to play whenever i see the icon. i havent played all civs but i got the whole set of civ 5 and i must say that the most of them are real fun, nice balance and the different types of winning, are a nice change to the other domination type games! i reconmend getting this game if you like strategy with nice 3d modeling(as well as 2d) a lot of possibilities to win, civs and good ai! the price may be high, but for the fun it payed off! (watch out winning has drug-like effects! ;p)",134.0

"this game did not start out as good as previous installations, but with the 2 major dlc and to a lesser extent the many minor dlc, this has earned the usual place as the best 4x game of this generation. i hope that the new alpha centari (or whatever they are calling it), will be a complete game upon release unlike this one, but as usual this is the gold standard for 4x gaming and something you definitely want to pick up especially if it happens to be on say a huge steam summer sale :)",283.1
"in all honesty, a game that is fun for the first few days but got boring really fast. there was no editor and really nothing else to do but the campaign. the mods were fun and entertaining for a long period but also got boring. not game worth 60$ but if they added some extra stuff i would definately buy it for 60$ again.",413.0

"this is a fun / calming game it takes forever and is turnbased",237.1
"very enjoyable strategic game. the expansions add a large amount of gameplay elements that increase the quality of an already amazing game. there are some issues with ai not being very smart, and high difficulties working through handicaps, but its an enjoyable game. 8.5/10",390.8
"this is addictive fun, get it. especially during exams.",61.7
"this game is fun when playing against humans. its terrible playing against ai. the npcs are way too predictable and non-threatening. if you build up your military quickly, you can overrun them every time. graphics are better than previous civs, but still just ok. ui and tutorials are good.",82.1
"i love this game. its a game of stadigy where you have to control a city and make it the best you can and beat all the other players on the map before they come for you. allthough the orignal map is quite small, you can just turn the settings to a bigger map! i rate this game a 5/5 allthough it was missing some really good fitures out of civ 4, they made up for it by making it in the dlc. + the dlc is so worth it.",10.8
"i enjoy it a bunch. a single game takes hours to complete, and the suspense of a new world each time you play helps to change up how the game will be played. i recommend it to those who enjoy sitting down to play an intense game for an entire afternoon.",364.1

"in has minor flaws but its an otherwise perfect game",193.3
"one of my favorite games of all time and compared to the newest one, which is about space(forget the title) it is by far better. it will seem old and dated graphics wise but, the concepts are wonderful and i could play this game endlessly. i used to play it on my laptop(not my gaming pc) and was forced to quit whenever turn 100 got around because my computer would crash. litterly 400 hours of life gone on civ and i didnt even play with people. great game but, it is amazing if you have friends to play with(which can last awhile, dont have any plans)",40.7

"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",14.1

"this game is the epitome of turn-based strategy. since its release, there have been so many major improvements across the board. dlcs, multiplayer fixes (multiplayer is basically 100% different than when it first came out, and thats a good thing), amongst other things. i cant say enough good things about this game. my only beef with it? when i pick random leader and it gives me venice.  venice. anyways, get this game, and dont choose venice as your civ. one of the best games in history.",558.8
"if you like creating an entire civilization from the ground up, this is the game for you! just buy all the dlc/ get the gold ediion so you can enjoy every piece of it. hopefully fireaxis does civ vi right and makes the game great on release, but super awesome on all expansions after that.",280.1

"civilization v is one of these games that can eat time like no others. i fell into civilization many years ago with the first game, and follow them without failing ever since, with never a bit of regret.",55.4
"one of my favorite games ever. civ v features such great variety that you can play for 600 hours (like i have) and it still feels fresh. the game is well rounded and each of the victory options is obtainable in an enjoyable fashion. each civ for the most part feels different, and most are tailored to a specific victory type. the ai is strong and on higher difficulties very capable of beating you, however its through boosts not skill.",842.9
"one of my favourite games of all time. the content in the vanilla game is huge but pair that with g&k and bnw expansions and the game has the most content i think i have ever seen.",158.6
"i will never get sick of this game. recently featured on npr as a game adults should play.",499.8
"just got the brave new world dlc and i didnt think they could make an already awesome game any better but, they sure found a way and i dont know how i ever liked the game without these new features. it added so much depth and more to do that it feels natural and that it just belongs there.",204.1
"its not a paradox game, but its fine for a civ game.",271.7
"this game is absolutely amazing, it becomes even better when you get g&k and bnw which are amazing dlcs.",161.1
"a true continuation of one of the greatest serieses of games.",12.3
"an excellent update to the classic series. the gameplay is streamlined but not simplified, and the hex-based map makes exploration easier and less time-consuming. the ai is a bit lacking, but civ has always worked best in multiplayer. it also feels like this game lacks some of the character that civ iv had. the soundtrack isnt as good and its missing those classic leonard nimoy tech intros. all in all, a great game, but id stick to iv for single player.",129.2

"ok, this game is basically- build a city, upgrade it, go crazy building units, and take over the world! (also some other small victories) in this game you want to build up your civ and to survive until you cant be beat. expert game in multiplayer, so i suggest giving it a try, and also to get this game!",158.9

"finallz after the brave new world expansion civ v really shines, i was initiallz disappointed when civ v first came out as it lacked many features that were present in civ iv with its expansions. with gods & kings and brawe new world the game is at last what is should have been then. a rethought and upgraded civ iv with some new features not present in the previous installement. a great game, too bad we needed to wait 3 years for it to be upgraded to be just that.",713.7

"the best civilization game of all, once it got gods and kings and brave new world. score 95/100. i have played it extensively and will play it again. it is a fabulous and deep game with so many gameplay styles that are viable. i love minor things like no more need transport ships and one unit per tile. the hex tiles are great as well and added a much-needed upgrade in the tactics. one of my 10 favorite game series ever, and the best one of the bunch. i cannot recommend it more.",206.7

"civ 5 is very much differnt then the other civs in many smalls ways which makes it a big way. i personally love this game, its hard to seige a castle, but its not impossible, and can even be easy if you know how to do it. it can be as easy or as complicated as you want. as easy because it can all be done automatic and all you need to do is watch, to as complicated because you can micro manage everything, including where your citizens work. civ 5 has a play style for everyone who likes turn based simulations. from dominating everyone, to being the best in a curtain amount of time, to being great friends with everyone. i strongly recommend this game, and as a hint to winning. pick a way of winning and stick to it. there are many ways to win, and if you stick with one, you will win.",251.7

"concise review pros- seems lacking in depth but once the game progresses the depth completely gets gigantic -very fun to play offline, most offline sim games suck compared to online, but this holds up -tons of playstyles and choices you can you to win -extra fat from other civ games have been cut off cons-mp has a large amount of bugs that hinder gameplay -game is too long for mp, most people (including myself) dont have time to sit at their laptop for 10 hours, but pitboss is too slow to play simultaneously rating- 9/10",238.9
"this game is a ultimate strategi based game with a lot of great dlc and extras. if you are willing to but time in it you will have a great time building up your empire.",77.6
"i played the original civilization. this one is a great improvement. the additional choices for victory allow the player to tailor the victory conditions to his or her playing style. this means if you enjoy management over combat you can play a game that suits your style. the ability to switch leaders also helps. so the game can work for either style",828.0

"not sure if it quite surpasses civ 4, but it gets significantly better with every expansion, and is itself an amazing game; its system is quite a bit different than civ 4, and is therefore worth playing for any lover of civilization",253.6
"great turn-based strategy game. highly recommended.",138.8
"i feel like the vanilla version of civ v was a step back from iv, but after the expansion packs, it has become a full civilization in my book. still not as good as civ iv, which i consider to be the best so far, but still good nonetheless. and it looks amazing.",356.2

"i really enjoy this game it is good fun. one downside is that it is long, but in the same it is good for me anyway because i love games that take a while to complete. i recommend it to anyone that enjoys building, war, or just playing with friends",491.0
"alone, civilization v is a great game, but with its two expansion packs and all of its add-on content, its one of the best strategy games one could ever come across on the market. so, if you want the full civ v experience youre going to need to cash out atleast on brave new world, which in many ways is the successor of civ v, the rest is really just great for the content it adds and increasing the variety in civilization choices as well as the pre-set scenarios. so overall, civilization v is great, but its outstanding with that second expansion.",556.7

"lots of fun and challenge in one game. i had a great time with the basic game so i can only imagine how great this game is with dlc! my country was super badass and commoners loved me not to mention the annoying neigbring country kept trying to attack my border cities but failed every time! lol in the end there was no winner. expect me.",14.7

"with the two expansions, civ v is a brilliant 4x game, perhaps one of the best out there (although i couldnt say; i dont have a lot of experience with the genre). an epic strategy game with an accessible learning curve but a very high skill (and knowledge) ceiling, with hundreds of different techs to research, distinct units for different eras, a functional diplomacy system, stellar religion and covert ops mechanics and big- nukes made better with friends. just make sure you pick up brave new world and gods and kings with it, because without it the game feels bare-bones.",117.2

"a very fun turn based strategy game, civ 5 is one of the best pc games i have ever played. no two games will be exactly alike, and you can play with 8+ friends in one game in the multiplayer. this is one of the games that got me into pc gaming, and it was my first steam game ever.",297.7
"it think it helps if you have someone who can help you with this game in the early stages, as it takes a while to remember what each of the things on screen actually does, but id definitely reccomend it. lots of options as to what you can do once youve got past the early stages.",18.4

"i was one of the first to buy this game in 2010, and i was also one of the first to stop playing this because i, like many others, felt it was a watered down version of civ iv. however, with the two expansion packs that seem lovingly crafted by firaxis, the game is easily one of my favorite 4x and strategy games of all time. the end-game was brought to life by bnw, and g&k fixed all the ai concerns i had. if you like strategy games at all, buy this game.",60.6

"great game highly recomend it. be aware that you will be adicted",49.0

"one of the best strategy/turn based games ever. it is complex at first, but it truly shines once you grasp all of its mechanics. additionally, the expansions add needed depth in combat, diplomacy and trade. brave new world improves the gameplay significantly whereas gods and kings did not add much to the game.",146.9
"this game feels less like a grand strategy or even a turn based strategy game and is more like a complicated version of settlers of catan. the hex shape is an interesting take on the original squares but at the same time its restricting with the one unit per hex limitation. it lacks a lot of features its predecessors had, while also adding some new ones. as of gods and kings its gotten a bit better but still feels lacking. its a fun experience with friends and the civilizations all are somewhat distinct. overall i think i could easily give this game a 7/10. its still leagues worse than alpha centauri but its alright on its own. if you can get the game with all dlc for under 15 usd, id say go for it.",133.1
"great game!! play this game 24/7 and is the most fun ive had in a game, especially on multiplayer!",208.1
"i liked this game quite a bit in vanilla, but the replay value was a bit stale for my taste. the brave new world dlc has really beefed up the midgame, and offered a variety of new options that keep games fresh. still not sure it was worth $30, but grab it during a sale and you wont be disappointed.",294.6

"10/10 stratagey game. lots of ways to win, plus room for experamentation. the base game isnt anything special, its the expanstions (gods and kings and brave new world) that really make the game. singleplayer is fun but this game really shines when playing online with friends.

"dont bother buying this game off steam. its a giant rip-off in comparison to the price and amount of content offered up by the gold version. search sid meiers civ5 gold and youll see that for $27 you can get almost all of the dlc, as opposed to spending $32 on steam for the game without any dlc.",85.1
"it is as good as they say. my fav civ ii, actually. i am not entirely in love with how picking a government is set up (it is a bit too gamey, in a way, and you dont have the sense of being anything in particular) but the rest on the game is pure gold.",87.7
"ive literally never spent as much time on a game in my life as i have with civ 5. massively addictive.",932.7
"firstly and most importantly: i have never played a civ game before. secondly, the first time i sat down and played civilization v, i played for almost 8 hours. consecutively. the game is that addictive, and i havent had that kind of hook on a game for a while. there are many ways to play and ultimately be the best civilization. the game might look unappealing and boring to some, but the game is really easy to understand, yet extremely deep at the same time. im mostly a strategy/mircomanagement person, so take this game recommendation with a grain of salt.",103.7

"amazing game, great to play alone and with friends, the dlc adds so much to the game as well, so much fun, my game of 2013",385.9
"this is a game that focuses mainly on combat and not much else. you wont find as much depth in here as you will in the previous civ titles.",94.4
"fantastic fun if you like turn based strategy. defintley great if your a history buff like me and can nerd out cranking out 40 panzers to simulate your own blitzkreig on the poor underteched cpu and then get nuked by gandhi the ...seriously...gandhi is the biggest prick of all the ai, but apart from that the games great. get all the dlc, g&k really improves the combat with new units (and civs i think?) while bnw just overhauls the entire late game to make all victory conditions more engaging, interactive, and entertaining.",217.0
"you werent gonna do anything worth while for the next 8 hours anyways.",660.5
"not going to lie, game may look weird, but its amazing. building your empire, attacking your enemys, the lost track of time, this game is worth the buy.",327.6
"i highly suggest you get this game, it is extremly fun to play with alot of friends.",42.7
"this is an absolutely fantastic game. i would reccomend it to anyone who likes an rts or even a city management game. it has elements which make it great for rts players, such as the war mechanics, but also has city building and citizen management. overall a great game. 10/10",73.8
"being a mainly fps or fps/rpg type games fan, i thought id try a different genre so i bought the complete edition on the last steam sale to just see what all the fuss is about. now i know its the most addictive, where did the time go, just one more turn game i have ever played, highly recommended",316.0
"i have never before found myself saying just one more turn so often :d",67.0
"this is a solid upgrade over earlier versions of civilization ive played. the cultural victory seems to be the easiest for most leaders to achieve. the game definitely makes you be active though. there is always one or two key resources that are in short supply around the world that you have to go out and find. some leaders play very different - kamehamaha for example who can embark on oceans right away. others, like ramses maybe not so much. there is more difference in how they act during the game than how they work when you play them, i think. but the differing skill levels and boards can keep changing the game dynamics - as can luck of the draw. there always seems to be some very crowded areas which force people to go to war and then one or two civilizations who are off sort of on their own with lots of room to grow. definitely worth playing around with and trying out different approaches.",231.9
"fantastic game. used to be a bit rubbish, but was massively improved by the expansions they released. now its incredibly engaging throughout the whole timeline of the game, even at the very late game. being in a position of power doesnt make the game any less interesting, because of the numerous victory methods, so the other civs always keep you on your feet.",72.6
"this game finally allows me to live out my disgusting roman fantasies with friends.",73.3
"this was hard at first but is still a very great game its a very different rts for those strategy lovers out there",99.5
"absolutely perfect. lots of fun if you want to create your own civilization the way you like it. youre free to choose whether you wanna concentrate on military forces and conquest, creating a tiger economy or the leader in technology. each time you start a new game you have to adjust your strategy to starting conditions - the terrain and locations of other players will play a major part in the development of your civilization, and it makes the game interesting even after having finished dozens of games. there are lots of leaders to choose from and each of them has its own pros and cons, including certain bonuses and special units/buildings. civilization v is really engrossing, but dont forget to buy complete edition with all add-ones - the game is not that deep without them.",181.8
"wish it had the civ iv sound of it. baba yetu, and leonard nemoy but great game still similar no stacking of units like in iv, the expansion packs are worth it also. the scenarios are hard, and the achievements are (good luck) impossible to get them all.",315.4
"i love this game, i am updated to gods and kings. i dont like how many civs have far too situational uas and uus, but i have heard that has been mostly fixed with brave new world. that said, i wish the expansions did not cost your first born child. like seriously, upgrading to brave new world doesnt even build off gods and kings! you have to have both if you want certain things. also many mods on the steam workshop (side note: the mods offer a whole new range of experiences and thats great, it keeps me coming back) require both g&k **and** bnw. you can spend a lot of money on this franchise, but if you have the dough its worth it. many mods fix some balance issues and its addictive as all hell. id recommend to people with lots of free time. if you cant spend hours in one sitting, this probably isnt for you.",197.8
"this is a great game. definitely the greatest single player turn based strategy game out there. everything is polished and the ai is memorable. brave new world is without comparison. every person who plays it loves it. non gamers can get into it, and realize how much fun it is. i recommend this to anyone. (with the brave new world expansion of course).",819.2

"its boring, historically an inaccurate mess, not immersive and slow paced as all hell. also one of the greatest damn strategy games ive played and know it to be the best ill play for long. until civ vi that is. supports a ton of playstyles and even losing a game would not bother, as its incredibly fun to just... build and develop your empire. also watch out, starting it once means all of your games will dust in your steam library for the next one to four weeks.",550.9

"as always, civilization is fantastic. i personally enjoy civ v over iv. the hex system and military unit changes were a fantastic edition. movement and combat requires a little more thought now than the blob of death from iv. the game is beautiful, runs well, has wonderful music, and with the workshop, adding mods is even easier now.",121.0

"what can i say, civ has been amazing for over a decade!",435.7
"sid meiers civilization v is a triumph in pc gaming. there is no other turn-based strategy game of its kind. civ v is the most balanced, complex (in a good way), in-depth and addicting pc game i may have ever played. this game oozes the just one more turn mentality and is hard to stop playing. with a plethora of races/civs to choose from, this title offers an uncanny amount of replayability. trust me, this game is a must have.",867.3
"saw american minute men get steam rolled by native american tanks. 10/10 would play again!",199.2
"great game. super fun. i like to make different scenerios like a tiny map with 22 civs. this game is very fun. it great. you can sit back, listen to some over-intense music on youtube and enjoy a friendly game of civ. until you turn the difficulty up, youll either need to be naturally gifted to win or focus extreme attension to it. thsts why i listen to 10 hours of the rocky theme while i take over songhai with my mongolian keshiks",203.2
"civilization v is an amazing game that has endless replay potential. i have never learned as much from a game as i have from the civilization game series. often i will be watching the history channel and realize how well the game implements the impacts of great world wonders on the growth of your civ. a must for all gamers with dreams of conquest.",350.6
"a great gamr i think that the hexagonl dimesion adds something to it.",54.8
"if you want to rule the world,and raise your empire this game is for you",220.5
"full of everything to keep you busy for hours that you should be spending on something else.",66.6
"civilization is a renowed strategy game franchise for a variety of fair reasons. few strategy games i have met with such a flexibity in the way you play, and even fewer with the addictiveness this game has. the one more turn... options is not entirely a joke, as youll always sturggle to keep playing. civilization has mantained a characteristic that difers it from other games, that is the universal focus it has. not just a military game. not just a social game. in civilization v you must pay attention to everything. from the unitis you control, to the number of cities and culture generated and such. when you compare civilization v with your ancestors, you see that the franchise has really developed, making very much more good changes than bad. civilization v is worth playing and a must have.",58.9
"so much fun! such long games ... cant.stop.playing",92.7
"awesome game if you dont have midterms to study for (time consuming and drags you in).",142.3
"civ 5 is arguably one of the best turn-based strategy games to date.",116.5
"this is probably the greatest game ever conceived by man. it draws you in, enticing you with a varity of choices, takes your hours from you, and wispheres into your ear one. more. turn. you realize that the night has passed when the sun glints through the window and you decide to adjourn from the game, but your mind never leaves it. you are always thinking of you next move, your next turn. you are an immortal authorian leader of a country, yet you are benevolent, you look to make your people happy thourgh the centuries and always looking for you next conquest, be it scientific, cultural, or by military. this game doesnt just define hexagonal-based strategy games, it defines you.",123.1
"awesome game, had it for about a year and i love it! just one problem, for some reason i am unable to create a religion! otherwise this is the best game i have!",72.0
"a good real time strategy. can get absorbed for hours. its almost like playing chess age of empires style.",57.4
"still flaming mad about spending 13 hours on a campaign just to have the huns convince everyone to attack me. it is a great (albeit time consuming) strategy game. im interested in trying the turn by turn play. 9/10",17.7

"took over the world as spain. if that doesnt peak your interest nothing will. 10/10",126.9
"think this series is one of the great simulation games especially civ v",43.0
"the best thing i liked about this game was the realistic approach towards battle and improvements in a country of your choice. if you have the dlc for this game it gets even better! not only does one understand and go through a learning process since the beginning of time and how war was waged and how countries and small states had alliances with each other but you get to make your decisions and they effect you in the long run. you can play a short game starting from the nuclear era and nuke cities and civilizations or you can go back all the way when iron and coal was found and work your way up into a new era! superb game with great and realistic rulers, buildings, monuments, wonders and warfare. a must if you like strategy games or were a fan of games like generals. but believe me, this is way ahead of generals or any civilization game you have ever played !",34.3
"the best game i have ever played! never gets old, a quality no other game i have ever played has.",379.7
"civ v is one of my favorite strategy games. i was never a huge civ player in the past, so take what i say with a grain of salt, but ive lost entire weeks to this game. nothing else has come close to capturing that much of my free time.",320.3
"its turn based, i feel like they should advertise that more. worst game i have ever downloaded or paid for. would like a refund but i dont think steam would let that.",0.5
"great game, will kill time immensily. great replay value a def. must buy.",45.8
"awesome game! the single player mode is flawless and the bnw expanison pack gives cultural victories more interesting. one major flaw is the multiplayer. the game tends to truggle towards the mid/late game period. player discconnect more often the longer the games goes on and it makes it very hard to complete a full game. however still and amazing game.",238.7
"i have two things to say about this. 1. nuking your friends is fun. 2. dont trust gandhi",78.7
"no game has given me more bang for my buck than this one here.",591.2

"great game. a lot of hours you will spend in building, making war, diplomacy and management.",17.7
"amazing graphics, great gameplay....what else can i say?",2.6
"one of the best strategy games ever. its so easy to lose track of time and get sucked into this game for hours and hours.",413.0
"i really loved this game. it had all the features i was looking for in a great game. the trades and borders are all a great touch, however, i do think you should add taxes",40.5
"a lot of fun, not too steep of a learning curve and the multiplayer is great. can be a bit laggy at times, but not usually anything that is not worth dealing with.",422.7
"this turned based strategy game will suck away your life. would recommend.",178.5
"a lot of fun multiplayer or singleplayer i recommend this game if you want a strategy game to play offline, it has a very high replayablity. the ridiculous situations you can find yourself in are amusing enough but that is just icing on the cake the feeling of toppling a rival nation is quite rewarding.",118.9

"great game to play with friends whether youre in a friendly helpint mood or want a mock war. also a great way to learn a few facts about world civilization. great game for those who love stategies.",249.5
"this is the best turn-based game that ive played. it has lots of civs with unique bonuses, good ais, multiple different ways to win, and good graphics. overall, its just about as good as it gets.",112.4
"this game is very good, but i recommend purchasing a complete edition with all the expansion packs, as civ v cuts out a lot of material that was in civ iv. much of this, (such as the spread of religion, the spy unit, etc.) was released in later expansions, which was quite the rip-off. its still an amazingly fun game however, despite this shortcoming.",155.2
"civiliztion five? more like frustration simulator 4000 bce - 2050 ce... god damn civies building the god damn wonders a turn ahead of me. 10/10 would recommend if you you havent had a good fit of rage recently",109.2

"must have for civilization fans.. im a long time civ series guy but i havent had a pc to run civ 5. i finally picked it up. i love it.",70.4
"civilization is one of those games that will never get old. for strategy fans this game is a must-have, and with all of the maps, civilizations, steam workshop items, and competitive multiplayer, this game will continue to suck up all of your freetime for years to come. civlilization 5 is easily one of the best strategy games that i have ever played (its up there with the original supreme commander and sins of a solar empire). i dont know how many times i have watched the sun set, loaded up a new game of civ, finish the game, and then stand up and strech while i watch the sun rise. i have discovered very few bugs/glitches, and really dont have anything bad to say about this game. easily 10/10 for me.",465.9

"a definite score, if you are able to obtain the game. the game dynamics are spot-on with cool animations. well thought-out game for any level of strategy gamer out there. it would rank up there on best games ive ever played. other than a few minor issues, the game is an easy 10/10!",262.6
"extremly time consuming game. really easy to get your moneys worth in game time. i have almost 300 hours in and have only (completed) one match. its a strategy game, but has lots of different aspects. it could be seen as more of a war strategy game, but its more than that. you have to manage your cities, your ecomonmy, diplomatic relations, religion, and technological advances. it takes a few hours to get into the game, but once you do it will be easy to get at least 100 hours out of it. 10/10",422.5

"as all sid meiers games, civ v and its expansions are amazing. you will play this game for tons of hours and never see everything it has to offer. all games are unique and the game is never boring. a modern classic and a must buy . rate 9 of 10.",194.8
"not as good as civ iv. but civ iv is one of the worlds best tactic games and not many games are better than it. civilization v is something new and special. there are new buildings, soldiers and diplomatic possibilities. when youve played it for some hours you know how it works and you can use the many different tools to become the biggest civilization ever.",65.8
"amazing game great gameplay and amazing graphics.the ai runs quickly and intelligently.",18.6
"especcialy with dlc this game can be huge and take hours to beat, addicting and strategic your friends will still hate you for no reason.",320.9
"great game, best empire building sim ive played in a long time, and the dlc adds an amazing amount depth to the game making all those boring turns where you had to wait more interesting by giving you spies to control, a religion to build, famous works of art to create and collect and dozens of new buildings, multiple changes to cultural unlocks and culture trees a complete re-work of the culture system, and several new units that fill gaps that never should have existed. (no more 300 years of archers followed by 500 years of crossbowman fights.)",343.7
"its wonderful if you want to sit down for a quick 10 hour match",48.3
"literally just random countries racing to space first no one even bothers to fight",67.3

"just one more turn you yell at 3 am after playing for 5 hours straight on the same game",52.2
"great game as long as you have paitence and dont quit like 20mins into the game. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gods & kings is a great expansion adding religon, new units, new civs, espionage, new buildings, new tecs. five stars sid meier much better than the clustered insanity of alpha centari.",230.6
"i cant belive that i played it for 1000 hours! every game has needed various situation and tactics.",1028.4

"the only game where invading a virtual version of mecca would get malaysian religious officials panties in a bunch. 5/5 stars from me. play it my friends and people who read this.",29.1
"too fun. word of advice though. if you ever see ghandi, kill him. hes a warmongering .",78.6
"fun turn-based strategy. ive found enjoyment through singleplayer and multiplayer. singleplayer is not the average learn as you play campaign. instead, you can chose from a variety of scenarios and make custom games tweaked to your liking. easy to learn and gets you hooked instantly. multiplayer is probably the golden highlight of the game, despite the immersive singleplayer. invite friends and start a unique game of your own. choose from many different options to make your game fun for everyone. in my opinion, this game is only complete with the brave new world expansion pack while others such as gods and kings are nice, too. with over 40+ unique and powerful civilizations, making your own way of play is as easy as ever.",92.1
"the first time i tried civ 5, i wasnt much of a fan of the strategy genre of games. that was until i play civ 5. it just simply has profoundly amazing gameplay, stunning graphics, and the replayability is great for trying out different styles of playing the game. it has exceeded my expectations, and i highly reccomend it.",40.9
"kind of boring and tedious, the leaders stay alive for 1000 years its like rise of nations but much slower paced",6.7
"awesome game. full of history and interesting gameplay. tons of achievements, too.",9.8
"i didnt think i had time for another civ game, but then i just stopped sleeping. or socializing. problem solved.",139.7
"i really recommend this game it is just so good. but make sure you get the dlc it turns it into a whole nother game.. grayson my friend doesnt own it and he wont buy it cause hes a dumbass with aids but its okay he doesnt know what hes missing just make sure you get it!!!!!",19.7
"love this game must get game or you will die a lonely life",55.6

"time to go to bed,... just one more turn,... and you see the sun rise again. 10/10",140.7
"it is a great game, i dont really see any flwas and its straightforward. since it is turn based it is pretty slow so i would recommend being patient and having alot of time to just finish one whole game.",54.7
"just like in real life people in this game seem to instantly dislike me and want nothing to do with me. anyway this game is still enjoyable, unlike real life.",64.0
"civ 5 is in my opinion the best civ made so far. all fans of the old and newcomers will spend many a day playing one of the most adictive games known to mankind. you may play many civs such as england, russia, germany , america and many more and each game will will be very different to the last. this game gives the meaning one more turn a wild new look. you may not call yourself a master of turn based strategy untill you have played civ 5.",448.2
"civ v is a fantastic game. it is such an enthralling world, that i forget to eat, forget to sleep. one more turn...",396.8
"im normally not very big into rts and i normally find myself constantly trying to kill things in games even when i shouldnt yet civ 5 somehow has me hooked playing for hours while trying to avoid combat as much as possible (and combat is fun). its an rts that has 5 different ways to win a match, 4 of which can be done without fighting. its unlike anything ive played before. ive already played almost 30 hours in 2 weeks, and thats pretty much exclusively playing with just two of my buddies online when they can join me.",56.8
"this game is the best. its a 10/10 except for the time you will spend playing it! 11pm turns into 4in the morning before you know it. i was so into today that i forgot today was my friends birthday....oppps cant wait for the new one!",81.5
"huge time-vampire. worth every minute though- its still fun, challenging, and mentally stimulating. my 95 hours is about 5 whole games on the fast-paced setting. this is the game you play when you want a week of your life to disappear suddenly. its easy to learn, but hard to master- especially with the all additions to mechanics the expansions make. again, 95 hours, no where near mastery myself. i reccommend that you get both gods and kings and brave new world- without them, the game is a little lacking.",105.1
"this a game where you consume every availible resource and kill everyone else until gandhi nukes you. 9/10 peaceful protesting is for chumps.",22.4
"civilization 5 is the primary reason of my having a steam account 10/10",362.4
"this is a fantastic game. i have been playing civ for over a decade...and this is so far my favorite in the series. i have had many late nights. just one more turn....",414.4
"amazing game that will definitely make the hours fly by.",427.5
"it is a wonderful game. started out with civ 4, was awsome. if you really wawnt to go above and beyond civ 4, you really need to get all of the expansion packs, otherwise it doesnt have as many features and feels like the only good thing is the graphics. i really like the game. buy it now!",519.3
"excellent game! be sure to nuke france atleast once!",110.9
"while different from most other games in the series, theyve certainly not failed to amaze me.",71.5
"i love the civilization series so much. so intoxicatingly addictive that you just cannot stop playing. i would highly recommend the bnw expansion with 5 as it really improves the game.",285.4
"warning!!!: this game is really addictive, you think you can handle one more turn but after 12 hours you realize it wasn`t one turn. i am person who really like strategic games and civilization v is the best strategic game so... best game ever made. 11/10",88.9
"i would write a total in-depth review, but i need to take 1 more turn. at least its only 8pm...",11.9
"fix the multiplayer. it reconnects like every 5 turns and its not our internet. fix this and ill recommend.",268.7
"civ v is a great game with lots of adventure and strategy, its fun to build your own settlement and to discover new techniques and develop your own civ. civ v does take a lot of time, though. an average game on the quick setting takes 4 hours! if you have no patience, i dont think civ v is the game for you. this game will train your strategy skill and will help you with other strategy games.",155.1
"this game is like squeezing blood from a stone, while talking to the night.",251.5
"i seriously cant get enough of this game. its absolutely wonderful and this sale is killer.",37.7

"fantastic game. expansions add moreplay through possibilities.",420.6
"unless you dont have the patience for the initial learning curve, or for the turn-based style of the game, get civ v with all the expansions--well worth it. it the most engaging time-suck ive experienced.",324.7

"[ one more turn, then ill do break ] ...6h later... [ okay.., seriously, this is my last turn now ] 10/10",40.3
"i cant recommend this game enough. its exciting, funny, strategic, athmospheric and its simply epic to create an empire that will stand the test of time.",162.1
"going on 300 hours and is no less fun than the day i got it 10/10",489.0
"this is a phenomenal game for any ability. when i first started i wasnt the greatest and now i have progressed and am alright. it is an incredible single playe game and is equally as good multiplayer seriously recommend this but its nowhere near as good without bnw.",312.5
"the amount of hours of fun i get out of this are awesome, best with parties though",117.4
"the best game out there if you want to feel like hitler. 10/10 great hitler simulator.",29.1
"extremely addicting.if you hate gandhi yet want a fun game then do a custom single player game with no gandhis and med diff. invaded belgrade,nuked venice thrice and adopted fascism. gotc,game of the century.our kids and aliens shall look down upen this game and not shun it because of its greatness",15.5
"my first game on steam. its the start of my addiction, i h ave since then moved on. however this game still remains one of my favourites because i played it the most and its what got me into the pc gaming community, it was awesome!",30.8

"stupid ai cheats, just like in the earlier games. frustrating to the point of screaming. and still, just ... on... more... turn ;)",69.8
"i dont know how anyone can recommend this game in the state its in right now. multiplayer is broken, completely unplayable. has been for over a month. still the skeleton of a fun game but the ai is very weak (once you get at all good the only way to have any kind of challenge is to play on levels that give it massive advantages over you) so being limited to playing against the computer is lame. save your money until they get it fixed.",503.1
"a great addition to the sid meier legacy. the new one unit per tile system is frequently frustrating, but introduces a new stratey angle to the combat system that makes combat much more engaging",326.0
"this is a great update to a long running series. ive got the gods and kings upgrade and i like what the religion aspect adds. i got really pissed at gustavus adolphus for converting my capital, so i did it back to him!",357.1
"the game is 4 years old and still has bugs that remove the enjoyability of the game do not play this try and earlier civ game where they actually fix the bugs.... (oh they fix the bugs if you buy all the expansions but vanilla game no...)",99.2

"i feel as though the best way to describe this game is risk on steroids",159.2
"had 2 cities, versus a civilization with easily 7. duel map. they were technologically scores ahead of me. i mass produced privateers and attacked their costal capital. within 3 turns, shaka offered 4 of his cities to me to end my onslaught. 10/10 would force my privates in again.",112.3
"another fantastic installment in the civilization franchise. i have been playing since the original version and although they evolve and change release to release, they always deliver. civ 5 is no exception.",266.2
"beware of gandhi he has nukes. requires expansions for the best experience",74.9
"definitley buy the brave new world dlc with this to enhance and add many new mechanics missing but even the base game is very addicting. you will yell at yourself to stop playing yet will always succumb to one more turn. great strategy game from my favorite strategy franchise of all time.",57.0
"what can i say? ive wasted 600 hours of my life on this game.",747.6
"this game is amazing! all the rewards it has gotten are well-deserved. i would read the full review on a website like ign or such, but if there is anything you can get out of my review, it is that you should buy this game. a perfect blend of in-depth building and strategizing, and fast-paced gameplay. with so many options to choose from, you really do choose your own path, again and again and again. with different gameplay options, many different factions to play as, infinite decisions to make and paths to travel down over and over, plus all of the mods and now steam workshop, you cannot go wrong with a purchase like this.",16.9
"not the most complicated or in depth strategy game out there but, defintely worth every one more turn you take.",319.8
"amazing game with loads of community made mods. get it if you love messing with histoy",95.1
"i enjoyed this game alot, definetly the best game i have ever played. i love the diplomacy system, easy modding, and ability to make your own story unlike most games.",418.4
"probably the best turn-based strategy game. it is engrossing and deep - a must play for anyone whos ever enjoyed a strategy game. + hundreds of hours worth of challenging playtime + best combat system of any civ game yet + you might accidently learn a thing or two - bot ai in co-op multiplayer is broken :( score = 4.5/5",222.3
"good game you can al ways find it on sale for $5 you just gotta look",89.5
"with the release of brave new world, the mecahincs of civ v finally feel reasonably streamlined. always something to build, lots of ways to achieve victory, and culture and tourism really feel like epic options to pursue. i would have to recommend getting both expansions to get the most comprehensive experience. the map and civ packs are also great additions, as each has radically different civs to try. theres a civ for every playstyle",107.6
"so. addicting. raising a nation and choosing how you will take over the world is such a detailed process that you can take hundreds of different routes to achieve it in this game. the amount of choices and control you have over every aspect of the game is incredible. would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy. 8.5/10",24.2
"even though a bit old, sort of fun in singlplayer, very fun in multiplayer. i would advise getting gods and kings or brave new world, as they fix some stuff. (liberty being op)",165.4
"fun #sooo fun, only played free trial, still by far best game #donottrustgandi",64.0
"this is the best investment ive made on steam so far. ive put 60+ hours into this game and im still hooked. playing as different civilizations and using different strategies creates endless possibilities and keeps things fresh. amazing game. 9.5/10.",60.5
"its a great game till gandhi gets a nuke so make sure hes gondhi before he can do manhattan",275.6
"first off: this game is damn awesome. ive been a fan of civ for a few years now, so i might be a bit biased, but civ v really is awesome. it combines the old style of civ iv with a new hexa-grid for even more awesomeness. if you liked civ iv, you will like civ v. simple as that.",280.4
"i just love the strategy in it. definitely keeps you moving, and your enemy ai appear real enough to fill out the worlds nicely, if a bit dangerously. =p",59.7
"one of the best games i have ever played. i recommend it to anyone who enjoys strategy games and taking over the world!!!!!!!",84.5
"a great game, however you should be warned, once you start multiplayer, single player will never be the same.",560.4
"three words best game ever!! great game to kill time.",163.7
"brilliantly designed game with a great multiplayer feature and, while heavy, the game barely every crashes or stops responding. i highly recommend it, but only if you have some friends to play it with. theres no problem with the singleplayer, but it gets boring after a while and i rarely finish a single player game because they take forever and you lose interest around half-way through. still a great game, and sid meier is held very highly in appreciation for this series.",947.7
"this game stole my life from me and made me a hermit. then i bought the dlc. if you want to have your life stolen from you, click add to cart now. enjoy.",332.5

"amazing game through and through. cant wait for the next installment.",470.1
"civilization is by far my most favorite series of games ever made. civ v lives up to a great tradition and more. you will lose yourself in what seems like a simple game on the surface. it can be a complex or a easy as you want to make it. playing twice is never the same.",52.5
"impossible to play just one more turn - amazing game.",73.0

"a game youll probably keep coming back to. replayability over years in my experience.",174.3
"the game where you set up a big group game with your friends one night, and then the friends who start falling behind get bored or need to go to sleep, conveniently before their capital gets nuked. 5/5",73.7
"get this game now! you will play it for hours. just trust me.",137.7
"diplomacy is utter horse . other than that i love this game.",125.6
"if you are a fan of the civilization games, dont let this game fool you. no you cannot stack units like previous versions, but there is such a layer of depth involving unit placement and strategic attacks that makes this game much more than any civ game that ive ever played. the dlc packs add a new level to this with religion and tourism, but the multiplayer aspect does need some work. mostly the connections can be quite bad. so save often if you are hosting.",209.6
"great game! very good replayability. steam workshop mods really make for an excellent buy.",229.0
"while i have never played any other civilization games this one takes the cake if only for its easy learning curve to get into it. having spent dozens of hours playing this the best thing the game has going for it is the infinate replayability and great multiplayer. i would suggest this game to anyone who loves games like total war or other strategy games.",187.6
"i recommend it. this game rocks. wrecking enemy empires with nukes and deadly super advance robots!",10.1
"just  consul montezuma of the aztics . never. trust. that. son of a . this is what this game will do to you. rivalry will be brought up . its such a good game that gets on my nerves. oh and dont ever play this game before going to bed. its one of those games that you will never get tired of. oh and if youre planning to get this, get the dlc packs as well, its worth it. just get the complete edition. its 100 percent worth it. you may get lost at the beginning , since there are a lot of stuff to go through before you get your civ ready to go. definitely worth the 30$.",19.1
"one of the most addicting games i have ever played. so deep, but easy to start. may take a lifetime to finish all the achievements.",156.7
"i dont understand how this game can be one of the most popular strategy games... its s-h-i-t... im not kidding, awful hexagone-style gameplay, didnt like it at all, but i have to admit that in the beginning when i first tried it out, i liked the diplomacy aspect of the game... the rest.. no so much",66.7

"this game has very fun single player that i have spent hours on my only complaint is the fact the multiplayer is very weak",89.5
"this game is as addicting and fun as the previous civilizations. the new ranged unit system is enjoyable and adds a whole new layer of strategy. any fan of the previous civilizations should pick this game up immediately. although if you are in school or college, do not pick this game up before any exams or tests. you will fail, but youll conquer the world!",86.6
"excellent game. you end up spending a lot of time, but its very relaxing. the expansions make it much better.",40.0
"good game, when i start a game i cant stop, kinda addicting.",292.2
"i dont think im very good at this game, but it is extremely fun. after watching some videos online ive started understanding things more and its quite entertaining. well worth the money.",88.6
"between all of the great mods and the strong strategic skill that civ v requires and all the tools provided that help introduce people new to the civ playstyle you simply cant go wrong with this.",365.8
"an absolutely fantastic strategy game for either single player or multiplayer. the new hex style board has made the maps of civ v even better than before. definitely worth the purchase.",167.3

"its a great game handles well and is ust amazing with other people",147.7
"being the first game i ever played in the civilization line, i have to say its really fun. it is long and sometimes can be quite fatigueing, but all in all i very much enjoy the gameplay. it could have more keyboards shortcuts, and ill admit sitting around waiting for things to get done does get tedious and boring. but the payoff in the end is quite satisfactory. i recomment getting the gold edition of this game, its worth it just so you dont have to do all that clicking.",129.4
"fun with friends and takes strategy to a new level, buy brave new world with it, and you will be satisfied.",92.4
"definitely worth a purchase with the xpacs, cannot wait for civ in space!",148.8
"this is one of the greatest games i have played in a few years. vanilla civ v is wonderful, and the dlc brings variety to the basic game, but steam workshop will allow you to play epic matchs without any risk of repeat fatigue. as of now, my play time is over 200 hours; you dont spend over a week on a bad game.",206.7
"with the multiple dlc the game offers its able to keep us from leaving for other strategy games. games are never the same to me and i keep enjoying it even when i get smashed by the ai. looking foward to civ vi",139.8
"worst game to play if you want to lose hours upon hours out of your life! in other words, i like it! now to go conquer some continents.",26.0
"now i hate all of my friends, but still play with them anyways. 10/10",350.5

"simply a perfect game. buy the game, play it and be happy!",468.4
"just spent a goof 4 hours playing this, and considering the normal length of time id play a strategy game for is about 10 minutes thats a good sign!",50.3
"not theres not enough people who have reviewed this game at this point but ill give it a shot. i think the first thing that needs to be known about this game is that it will take up a lot of your time, i mean a lot. dont start this game if you have anything else you want to get done in the next several hours. that out of the way, this is one of the best turn based strategy game franchises out there and this game only serves to improve the franchise and the genera! the introduction of hexagonal tiles allows for more interesting movements and strategy. over all if you are at all considering this game, just pull the trigger, buy it, and watch your life outside it disappear.",115.0
"what can i say? you will spill days into this game without noticing. its kinda like crack, but better. i would pay to play this game again if i had to. so what the hell are you waiting for? buy it! and make sure you have at least 6 hours of free time before you get on.",268.8
"it is a change, but all new civ games have some game play changes. those graphics though...",30.3
"buy this game and all of the dlc! a ton of fun and totally worth every cent! the more to play this with, the better it gets!",197.2
"as a new civ player, i must say that i used to hate this type of strategy games (turn based) and considered my self an rts player instead. now that i tried civ 5, i must say that im hooked to the game and its innovative mechanics. playing against the ai is alaways fun, and the multiplayer experience is fantastic. the amount of customisations you can do to the game is great, especially with the addition of community content. the sound track is brilliant and the options menu has way more options than you could possibly need to tweak. if you are considering giving turn based strategy a go, i defiently recommend this game.",113.1
"i got sid meiers civilization v a bit ago and i have to say that it is probably the best game i have ever played! it has hours upon hours of singleplayer gameplay, hotseat and multiplayer. it also has one of the greatest selection of mods to choose from with the downside that some may require a dlc which is fine since the dlcs themselves are a great and worthwile purchase. 9.5/10",139.0
"great game, worth the money, keep you busy for weeks...",888.2
"i nuked gandhi. killed millons of people. wiped out entire civilizations. mowe(e)d down armies with superior technology. did`nt feel bad about it. then i got back to real life. ate something. walked in the nature. accidentaly broke a little stick on the ground. thats something i feel bad about.",381.9
"recently bought this game and it quickly became one of my favorites.definetly buy this game if you are into strategy games.",26.4
"so great. one of those time suck games - youll sit down to play for an hour and look up and the sun has just cleared the horizon!",652.0
"this is no game. it is a time warp. apparantly i have 91 hours played. it feels more like 10-20. you have been warned.",281.6
"jesus the christ this game is so addicting with a turn taking system and grate ai you my sit in your chair for about a day or two just to finish you can tell yourself only one more turn but if that where the case how could gandhi nuke you",93.9
"my friends and i play this together. i name my cities after fast food chains. very fun.",110.8
"this is such a great game!! cannot wait for the new one :)",93.8
"what can i say that others havent? this is a great game that i keep coming back to!",388.7
"strategic and entertaining. most people are aware of this hexagonal obsessed series but after 77 hours, i can say this is the most addicting addition of the series. noteable strengths: runs well on low end computers. well done economy system each tile has significance and is strategically unique fast pace late game custom maps excelent unit ballance. weaknesses: slow early game long initial loading time ai faction reputations need work. overall a good game well worth buying. if you are looking for an entry to turn based strategy, this would be it. the main thrill peronally was managing my economy and military over a massive spread out faction on a global custom map.",107.4
"civ 5 is truely a great game. with the way you must think of where to place cities and what to build as well as making sure other civs are not mad. must pick up and try!",48.0
"civ v is one of those games that you want to play a little bit after dinner and then you realize its almost breakfast. with all the expansions, this game is so vast, so varied and with so much written into it you wouldnt even scratch the surface 100 hours of gameplay later. i highly recommend it for people that arent strategy fans too  playing in an lower difficulty still gives you an enjoyable experience from end to end.",132.6
"only recommend if you get both expansions with it. the ai may be schizo (and cheat a lot) and the game may not have the depth of a grand strategy title, but its still a fun time sink. theres a lot of fun to be had with the civ+victory type combos. there are also a lot of great custom maps and mods for this game (though using mods prevents you from getting achievements if thats your thing).",344.1
"this must be the best game ive ever bought. you decide youre going to play a short game, and like 6 hours later, you still want to play.more addicting than crack cocaine 20/10",237.0
"this game is a time machine in disguise. i started out in the world as a fresh faced settler, ready to learn and grow, reaching out to all of the other civilizations i stumbled across, my arms open wide in friendship. ten hours later and my civilization has taken over two of the neighboring countries for sending missionaries into my territory against my wishes, and i have been labelled a warmonger. i have atomic theory researching and will be able to unleash the atom bomb on any other civilization that looks at me sideways soon. dear god, what has this game done to me?",146.7
"created the great empire of rome in 1980, also a good cheaper alternative to be. btw it will kill you social life just check the time i have wasted.",259.7
"this game is very, veeery addicting. gandhi nuked me, 23/10, valve no not nerf.",71.4
"by far the most addicting game on steam. i swear you sit down and turn around not only is your youth gone but so is your innocene. and yes ghandi is a jerk in the game...",175.8
"i gave up my social life and sleep for this game. worth it.",175.5
"a great turn-based strategy game with a huge replayability value. while most of the victory conditions are not perfect, the combat is excellent and makes going to war an interesting and fun experience where strategy is more important than force.",553.7
"one of the best 4x games on the market. with all the expansions it is amazing, without them, its still fun, but you are missing out on a lot of features.",483.7
"10/10 would buy again (if for some strange reason steam doesnt exist in the future)",151.7
"i picked this up during the summer sale. i never was a big fan of strategy games until now. 80 hours later and all i can think about is napoleon is a  and if people dont stop sending missionaries into my land, im going to nuke every other civ to ashes... and theres giant death robots so theres that too.",107.4
"this game is by far the perfect strategy game. the gameplay, ai and general fun surpasses all of its competitors, and its ability to eat up your life is completely unparalleled. i would recommend this game to everyone. gandhis a  though.",37.7
"whats with the game last i played it ,it was last night 10/23/2014 but the game said last day i played it was on tuesday that would be 3 days before now it wont let me play the game without paying for it, so in my opinin the game is not worth downloading, playing it for 3 times then gotta download the 49.99 to 23.99 upgrades is not worth the time on free games,, i would not recommend to anybody to take the time to download this game!",0.2
"definitely not a game you should start up when you have something important scheduled. you know, like... sleeping or eating. the just one more turn syndrome will keep ordinary things like these well out of your mind. try the marathon mode if you dare... the multiplayer mode used to be bit wonky but it pretty stable after the last patches. definitely get both expansions for the best experience (the complete edition is usually up for 10 bucks during the steam sales).",683.1
"good game, does consume a lot of time. mods and the dlc improve the game greatly",251.2
"love this game. 14/15 as the multiplayer is a little shabby.",182.5
"you can say alot about civilization... how it kills your social life, sucks away weeks and months like a black hole... but non of that changes the fact that civilization v with its expansions is one of the best tbs games abount, if you enjoy detailed, engaging tbs - that will give you an unforgiving challenge if you ask for it, or just a casual relaxed game you cannot fail with civ5. to my wifes despair - take a look at my hours in this game.. :)",199.2
"this gam is awesome! although it may not be historically accurate... i p155ed of ghandi and he declared war on me and nuked beijing. he then captured my people and held them as slaves, and then set fire to my one beautiful cities... also i am in a gam that has lasted me at least 5 hours and i am not even half way through, also i modded it and beat up hitler so yeah... 10/10 and stuff.",29.2
"they did not give me the gold i desired. i nuked them. 10/10",141.0
"very fun game to play on both singleplayer and multiplayer. great strategy game that allows you to test different scenarios that you choose to craft. highly recommended to you guys!",463.5
"super fun war game. playing with friend is the best way to play this game. but is still reccomendable on single player. build up cities upon cities of foundation on your civilisation and watch is thrive or be destroyed be superior forces. great game. only problem is tabbing out is super laggy and also the steam severs are of poor qualty on this game, would reccomend creating own server. 9/10",45.7
"this game shows thing that happen in the past, the present and the future which you can combind many stragtegy to win over your enemies.that include be common enemy to someone or make the alliance to overthrow the most powerful player from his seat of this game which can be done throught many ways either direct or from the way that they would never notice what coming for them.",82.9
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played 8.5/10",275.9
"what other game could i say i defeated julius caesar with giant death robots ? excellent game that allows thoughtful and even sometimes maniacal crushing of another civilisation. a possible downside would i felt mid-way through a campaign i was merely next turn ing until my society had advanced to a powerful state.",163.9
"a fabulous game that carries on the civilization zeal for complex games that you dont mind spending days and days playing, yet never feel disgruntled at the prospect of starting over with a new civilzation, quite the opposite in fact. i relish the thought of starting a new game with a new map and perhaps a civilization ive never played just to see how it fares. civ 5 is a must for any civilization franchise fan, and equally recommended for anyone looking to break in to the genere of turn based strategy games. like a board game but prettier, and you dont have to hope the cat doesnt destroy it when you walk away. get civilization 5 asap, you are missing out!",162.1

"one decision after another, one turn to something exciting. you cant stop until you win, or you rage quit.",901.3
"this game- for little i have to say im terrible at it. but one thing this game did was impress me with its overwhelming amount of features, ive only scratched the surface! this game seeks to amaze me and delivers which is why it gets a seal of approval. i rate it around 5/5 (perfect score!)",66.1
"needless to say, civ v is a quality product - tons of content, hours, and i mean hours of gameplay, all wrapped in beautiful graphics and sound. brilliant.",192.2

"one of the best games ive ever played. such addictive one more turn gameplay. everybody needs to try this at least once.",497.3
"...just... one... more... button... this game is epic! well worth the purchase (esp on sale day)! i strongly suggest you get the expansions as they add great elements to the game, as well as some common sense fixes to technology and military progression. ranged/melee ships become available throughout the game. archers can upgrade throughout the game. iron isnt necessary for early seige units. just some really great stuff that makes your gaming experience all the more pleasureable... just... press that button one more time... and watch your days disappear 10/10",677.8

"this is my favorite civilization yet. its beautiful, fluid, and still retains the just one more turn addictiveness the series is known for. the music is outstanding as well, with themes written for each country that shift and change as you progress through the game. the new tactical warfare really makes a difference too; gone are the stacks of doom from previous games. its a meat and potatoes tactical addition that really sets this iteration apart from previous games imo. its a must-own for fans of the series or turn-based strategy in general.",307.4

"this is an extremely addictive game. there are dozens of different civilizations that you are able to play as, and each of them have unique benefits over eachother. be aware that this game is very time consuming, and if you are not the patient type, this may be a boring game for you. (my first game took about 30 hours) overall it is a great experience that you shouldnt miss out on.",110.7
"before this game, i had always dreamed of a strategy game that wasnt all about war. in this, you can have cold wars that last for centuries, or you can be in a state of total war from the very beginning. there is a great amount of flexibility, replayability, and awesomeness.",338.8

"this is a game you can easily lose a day too. 4x games always look incredibly boring too watch but once you start playing one you just cant stop. gods and kings and brave new world are pretty much required too get as the base game was a little too basic. the five different victroy types make finding new strategys all the more fun.",194.8
"great game. not only is it fun signle player it is even better multiplayer.",141.6
"i think civ4 modded to death still wins out. civ5 is catching up quick and i think it will take the place as my favorite civ. no matter what the panzer general type combat and terribly unbalanced build times will always throw me off. 7/10 - good game, but has issues, and i dont agree with the game mechanics direction the series took here.",745.4

"this is civilization at its best and over time it will ripen like a fine wine and become a masterpiece. 2k games have outdone themselves in making some massive changes without changing the core gameplay and alienating their fans.",7.9

"this is so addicting and fun if your good at point and click games",217.8
"this is the most addictive game ive ever played. the relationship you have with other civs is complex and rewarding to those who try to be a good diplomat. unfortunately, civs sometimes do things randomly and ruin relations with other civs because of it. the game demands for planning and careful thought for each turn. this is not a fast pace game. it is for those who like to micro-manage and work best at a slow pace. future plans for your empire and war with another will always have you chanting just one more turn.",312.1

"extremely addicting. i find myself saying one more turn and before i know it ive played 50 more turns. its better when you have brave new world, gods and kings, and all the dlcs. if you see a sale, jump on it quick. paying full price is worth it, but not recommended. just....one.....more...turn.",49.4

"i love playing this game. ive played this game so much (different accout because no family sharing thing), almost 300 hours, and im still not bored. the expansions make it even better, and its incredibly fun to play with different leaders and trying out different strategies. definitely recommended!",54.5
"very entertaining game with a very complex , yet easy to understand, system.",40.2
"this game is unique in so many levels. they make all the leaders act the same as if in real life and every difficulty has a diffrent strategy that only trial and error can solve. will you be warlike? or cultural? or even a gleaming beam of hope of technological wonders can your civilization hold as you conquer barbarian nations. can your empire stand the test of time?",295.4

"great game but only if ur into strategy based games",192.7
"this game is great and mods make it better. get the complete eddition or most mods will not work. theres is a lot of good game here. dozens of civs make you change your play style each time and the music is great and fits the mood. i have never played any other civ game before but this is a great introduction. diplomacy is a bit strange and you may find your allies abandon you to ghandi but its still really fun. eventually you may get bored and thats were mods come in. the workshop is filled with tons of mods fixing minor problems or ones that add entire new maps and civs. a great game theres no better feeling than seeing the information circles side down your screen telling you the mordor has delcared war on skyrim",316.8

"it is just to good! i bought it last weekend and already have 30 hours in it. if u can buy this game",184.0
"missing a few good old features from the 4rth, but still a really good game. some new features, like the 1 unit per case and the hexagonal format, are pretty great and change a lot of things when thinking about strategy. for thos who miss the religions, i also recommend the expansion, kings and god.",562.7
"probably the best turn-based god game ever.after the first four games civ v has lots of improvements there is no more religion which is probably a better idea and has city-states which are a quite good idea also the interface is much more streamlined.there are a lot of options for your civilization from america to france.also now the game is on a hex-based grid its a lot better than the old square-based grid.you need to take your civilization from cavemen to the future.watching as you advance in technogly run low on money and try to regain it,you are invaded and denouced as you need to built farms,new cities,mines,quarrys. an excellent game! 10/10",288.9
"this game was the first game i ever got on steam and it is still the game i play the most. even without all of the dlc, this game will ruin your nights if you play it before you go to bed. i strongly reccommend getting the brave new world dlc because it gives you features that make hundreds of more replays possible. 10/10.",109.3
"if you like to spend hours playing as russia just to butt  america or any other equally annoying country get this game. you start out as 2 units some  settlers and some soldiers who are ing terrible. then you slowly build your way up to the point where you can nuke your enemies with little to no consquences. the a.i. will hate you but who gives a , not this guy. so after your done with you little nuclear holocaust, why not start another game. this time you can win a diplomatic victory which will never work out, or you could win as a cultural victory which is boring as , same as the time victory.",105.3
"a game that makes me feel great. creating the single most authoritarian superior atheist society on the planet, while i send my crusade of euphoric intelligence across the planet in a stream of blood, tears, and nukes. all in the name of chairman walrus. all hail the hail the master of euphoria 7/10 it was okay",193.9

"cant believe ive waited so long to play this game! ive owned it for ages, i decided to give it a go after watching the trailer from e3 for civilization: beyond earth and got really into it! the graphics are good, the gameplay is fun. considering i love playing strategy games ive no idea why i havent played this sooner :p! granted the match did last 9 hours, i dont know if thats just me being new or the fact theres so much to do and plan out in the game that a good match takes that long to complete, thankfully it was in single player mode so no one was waiting on me to make a move haha! if you like strategy games & enjoy getting into all the mechanics of a well thought out conquest then this game is for you! i would highly recommend it!",14.2
"i liek dis game, it gud game. make happy many deyz of wiek, yay 4 killing and democrazy. c5 is rully gud.",79.3
"i think....i love this game. diplomatic options were sorely limited and happiness was a thing that i though needed a ton of work but, over all it is an awesome incarnation of the series. it is incredibly difficult to please me as im always wanting more so take my opinion for what it is....",742.2
"good game if you like to just kill time. really entertaining and challenging if you increase the difficulty but otherwise fairly easy.",514.1
"awesome game! first civ game i have ever played and i enjoy it a lot. easy to get into and once you start, you wont be able to stop!",91.9
"one of the best games ive ever played. even better with dlc.",621.2
"at this time, this game is priced as an aaa game title, when it is more of a deluxe mod of civ 5. it is also in more of a beta state than a finished state, with some glaring and a few shocking features not available. i would highly suggest waiting till several patches, and also several price drops happen before purchasing. after that, it may be worth the purchase and somewhat enjoyable.",591.7
"this is probably the best strategy game ive ever played hands down. so many ways to win but my favorite has to be attila the huns. he is designed to erase the first guy you meet off the map. op.",122.8

"good game, makes wasting your whole day very easy.",73.5
"this game, was a fan since civ 4, and this game is a great sequel. so i do really reccomend this, if your a fan of strategy.",559.6
"though not without its faults, for fans of turn-based strategy this is one of the best games currently available. addictive, with enough variability and opportunity for skillful play, it can keep your attention for sessions of 14 hours or longer regularly. highly recommended for anyone who enjoys strategic thinking, resource management, and games that challenge you to dig deeply into mechanics to learn and improve.",433.4
"this game is like heroin, you just cant stop playing it. youll tell yourself just one more turn and then ill quit but later realize that youve sunken six more hours into the game. youll alienate your friends & family just so you can teach those dirty huns not to  with your cities while gandhi nukes your  of the planet. so yeah, get this game if you like doing hard drugs.",73.9
"this game is really awesome but i have never really played rtss before so im kind of awful. fun though, id tell my friends to try it if they havent already.",19.0
"if you like building big empires, large armies, and eventually nuking all of your enemies then i would pick it up while its on sale.",103.1
"this game is a ton of fun, but requires strategy to win in the end.",349.4
"coming from a guy that never really was into strategy games. this has to be one of the best buys i have ever done during a summer sale! a must have game!",60.1
"get the complete set if you can. not just the gold edition, but also brave new world. it makes the game a thousand times better. not that the vanilla game isnt good on its own.",238.0
"this is an amazing game the game might take a long time but it is well worth the wait it is one of the best stratagy games i have ever played 10/10",54.7
"it was a beauty to play, cannot stress how much fun this game is. anyone looking to spend a good few weeks playing hours on end with their mates on this easy to understand game, i would reccomend to get this. will need to however consider getting a good pc, as i have found out that laptops are not ideal, however a normal desktop on a low setting will do just grand.",147.4
"bought the civ 5 brave new world expanison a day before it went on sale for 7 dollars. fml 10/10",42.0
"gets rid of some of the annoyances of previous civilization games while maintaining a classic feel. i highly recommend this to any civ fan.",83.2
"civilization 5 or how i like to call it civ 5 is one of the best strategy games i have played like the total war franchise this was just amazing and addictive what more to say other then this game should be on your wishlist or shopping cart.",26.2
"civ 5 is so addicting! its hard for me to pull myself away from this game even after 5-6 hours of non-stop playing. i enjoy playing with my friend as well, we conquer as a team and even seperately. its very interesting to see how your civilization can progress. i havent gotten far down the tech tree yet, im actually hoping to do a more relaxed game, less war, so i can experience the progress of the eras. i do not really have anything bad to say about this game. i do wish one thing could be tweaked and thats a barbarian slider to say how often they appear or something. thats all. i love this game and highly, highly recommend playing it over beyond earth -.-",42.0
"on the one hand, the hex grid layout is an improvement, though i dont think its a huge one. cities having their own defenses is also a nice update, and makes a lot of sense: cities in this game really ought to have static defenses. ranged attack units attacking at, you know, long range is also a bonus. that said, i think combat has, overall, taken a huge step backwards. units cant stack. that means a combined arms approach is much harder, and the amount of space an army takes up is actually less realistic: really? a unit of spearmen takes up as much ground space as an entire city? for all its flaws, i think civ:ctp was the only one of the series to get land combat right. as a final note, this is the first civ game where ive ever said ill just play one more turn and actually followed through. draw whatever conclusions you will from that.",319.1
"completely fun and addicting would recommend to everyone. late game can be a little frustrating if you are going for a domination-victory.",62.9
"ive only played a few hours into this game, playing on an easy difficulty to get the jists of things. its amazing the amount of content in this game, it keeps on suprising me!",20.7

"this game is supa awesome!!!!!!!!! if you like strategy games youll love this, definately worth the buy.",26.3
"civilization has grown a lot since its humble beginnings with version 1 of the game. one that i played for years. with all the new graphics, the diplomacy, intrigue, and all the fun new techs and buildings to explore, civilization 5 (especially with the gods and kings add-on) is the pinnacle of the series. this game will have you saying just.. one... more... turn....",49.8
"how do i recommend this? all i know is that i enjoy it, being a highly technically advanced civ with enough firepower to send everyone to the stone age... if they werent already there.",535.4
"a lot of improvements since civ iv. religion shouldve been in the vanilla game, but theres not really that many problems. definitely worth buying, as long as you have a lot of time on your hands because civ is very addicting and games can take a long time to finsih on some settings.",92.4
"works just awesome on linux. great port! about the game itself, it is simply a great turn based game, if not the best in the category!",32.8
"this game is an amazing strategy game. its not fantasy or anything like that. what i love about this game is how realistic it is. you really have to think what your stratgey will be against other players and npcs. the only bad part is the time you have to spend on this game. if you are willing to spend a lot of time on playing game or games, then you will enjoy this game for sure.",106.1
"this is the most addicting game i have ever played. get it. get it twice, and give to someone you play games with. you will not be dissapointed, actually you will be negative dissapointed.",284.4
"awesome game, many choices of winning and different leaders to play. can play for hours without stopping",89.3
"i think the civilization series is great. overall i give it a 8/10 concept: same as other civilzations, 7/10 gameplay: outstanding at how many options there are! 8/10 graphics: incredable: 10/10 price: waaaaaaaay too pricy,but thats what happens to big company games. wait a couple of years it will go down though.",77.7
"what can i say...ive played so much this, that i have the menu song stuck on my head.",38.9

"this game is the best for reenacting ww2 only the axis wins. that, and manisfest destiny. manifest bestiny.",105.8
"if youve ever wanted to rule the world . . . .this game is for you. if youve ever wondered what developing a god complex is like, yeeeup. are you the type of person that would, if handed the reigns of civilization, put its full focus toward the development of fusion powered robots; just to satisfy a grudge from when denmark laid siege to your city and then denounced you in front of that cute celtic warrior gal? if so, i think you know what you must do. kiss your family and friends goodbye, forget about your dreams, plans, and aspirations; and play one more turn.",135.0

"this is the single greatest turn-based strategy i have ever played. the battles are fun and paced well, the economic system is well crafted, the diplomatic sysem is interested and keeps you on your toes as you try and figure out what each opposing ruler is planning, and the city building is quite unique. if you like strategy games or justwant a low-stress, relaxing, and fun game to play, then buy sidmeiers civ v. you wont regret it.",286.6

"when i first began playing this game it felt as though the learning curve was huge! i definetly had fun playing it, but i had matches that lasted for hours and then i would lose without knowing why i lost. its worth picking up again, i would say, to learn how to play it better, but its definetly a time consuming game. i was never really familiar with the civilization games to begin with, so im sure that didnt help with the learning curve.",19.6
"this is a great game, great for newbies to the strategy genre. the vanilla game is around 8/10. now for the expansions, buy them, theyre great. they make the game a ton better. 9.5/10",118.3

"what can i say about sid meiers civilization v? it is seriously one of my favourite games to date. it is an amazing turn-based strategy, that does not feel like either genre! you slowly build up your empire untill your number one, or you get left behind, choose one of the multiple ways to win, whether its world domination or the magnificent space race. i feel like anyone could play this game with or without your friends and still have a great time. wait did i say with your friends? yup it has multiplayer. as you are building your civilization why not invite your buddy? where both of you get to compete with your friends to see who is the better conquerer! i hate turn based games, but this is great game that everyone can enjoy! p.s. and remember, dont trust ghandi :p",15.8
"45 hours into this game and watched a 117 part playlist of it... this game is a must buy.",200.4
"if youre looking for a strategy game thats not very deep or intensive, but still fun and addictive civ 5 is what you want. the game isnt as intense as some of its predecessors, but has grown into a fantastic game over the years and is definitely worth playing. i would also reccommend you get the brave new world dlc, as it adds a lot more interesting mechanics to the game that make it even more addicting.",659.0
"favorite game in my library. super easy to pick up and learn and before long youll be playing for hours on end. endless possibilities in map and leader combinations, so each and every game you play will be different. highly recommend this game, even if have never played a turn-based strategy game, this was my first one and i love it.",698.4
"civ 5 is a brilliant game. it has beautiful graphics, perfect performance (on proper machines that can take it) with detailed and handy systems for creating your own civ. i suggest the dlc due to its offering of a new religion you can personalise which is always fun. gets boring pretty quickly, ive found it best to play in multiplayer with friends as it gets very boring very quickly as theres not much action at the start, even if you set the speed to fast. beautiful will run on most computers boring at points",33.2
"highly addictive, typical civ game but more polished.",144.3
"i once decided to start up civ v, hoping to play a couple turns, then get back to work. i managed to quit at 2:00 in the morning.",103.1

"great way to make huge chunks of time disappear. 9/10 - some ai annoyances but other than that this is a great game.",17.4
"civilization v is an expansive and interesting game with great detail and political strategy. as i can attest, it is relatively easy to learn but difficult to master if you are new to the genre or the series. i eagerly await the release of beyond earth, as this game has given me a great introduction to strategy games and the civilization series. p.s. you should definately check out the steam workshop mods, they give the game a whole second life.",72.9
"i fell in love with this game the second i played it.",91.7
"amazing and addicting game! loved it and look forward to every summer morning to go on civilization! :d totally would recommend this game! <3",169.5
"theres a few things that i dont like about the transition from civilization iv to v but overall its an incredible improvement. the visual improvements are outstanding! there are a few things i wish were implemented from iv, like trading maps, trading technologys, world editor. but all these things are made available by community workshop mods.",288.2
"amazing game with great graphics and tons of gameplay and i love all the music for each leader and their own special historic units and buildings.",354.4
"just... one... more... turn. theres one simple reason why ive avoided playing this game, its so easy to get lost in it and before you know it, its 3am and youre wondering where the times gone. definitely worth it.",42.0
"civ 5 is a fantastic game. ive been playing it for a while and have no bad comments about it whatsoever.",129.9
"nothing like having the aztecs sink your roman aircraft carrier with a nuclear submarine in the year 2100.",277.2
"this is the best strategy game i have ever played. 10/10",22.9
"extremely fun strategy game. allows you to take control of a civilization and better the world or raise hell in it. the game is good without the expansion packs but with them the game becomes a masterpiece. every move counts and you have to really think about what you do far in advance. the game itself isnt very user friendly so if you plan to buy it watch a tutorial here",121.4
"time for another review! im going to go over a few points in the game, and then average them out to give it an overall rating. i still recommend it no matter what the oar is! story: 0/10 there is no story. replayability: 10/10 ive played about 1 week of gameplay. thats a lot for me! content: 8/10 if you buy the dlcs, its got loads of content, if not, it would get 5/10, but i bought them :) multiplayer: 5/10 its got a lot of multiplayer glitches, but fun nonetheless. it cracks me up when it resyncs and my scout turns into a gdr. overall rating: 6/10 (rounded up and simplified)",289.0
"awsome game can be simple or complex as you like at the easy diffculty. but at the top levels you need to be on the ball every move. the game allows you to be in control as much as you like from choosing citizen output. all the way to let me make the key choices. it simply is one of the best strategy games in my opinon.",72.9
"best played with brave new world but still a good game without it.",79.6
"i need to go outside at some point. destroyed my social life and my view of gandhi. 10/10.",173.1
"awesome game. i love the enhanced diplomacy compared to earlier civ games.",43.7

"i gave ghandi truffles, he gave me nothing to call home. 10/10 would ghandi again",128.0

"got nuked by mayans 10/10 will name my first born child pascal",4.7
"the first civ game ive ever played and it makes me wonder what i missed out on before! its an extremely addicting game that is relatively easy to pick up. at the same time, im always learning something new too. the dlcs add a lot of interesting concepts to the game and i would recommend them if you can get them at a good price. for the amount of time ive put in, this game and additional content is well worth the prices (especially since i got it during the steam summer sale!). just remember to look out the window, stand up and get back to the real world every now and then!",279.4
"its very good. i recommend playing with at least the gods and kings expansion. for more balanced multiplayer, the third one is good.",395.8
"would love if there was a way to upgrade to gold or complete. i currently own civ v, gods and kings and brave new world. i dont really want to purchase all the dlc or re-buy the entire game.",454.7
"the last time i played when i was done i realized it was 2am and have played for 13 hours straight",204.6
"an amazing, addictive, turn based strategy. modding and multiplayer are incredibly easy to use. brave new world is an awesome expansion! if you havent played it, go buy it. now.",150.1
"1 word can describe this game, amazing, but that makes for a sucky review. this game is all about building a civilization, and trying to develop it to be better that the others in the game. you develop new technologies, fight wars among the other civs and city states, conquer land and found cities, spread religion (dlc required), and nukes. :uranium: there are some amazing mods out there for this game, just an amazing game overall,",374.2
"the only downside to this game is that u will lose your life to its awesomeness !!!",18.2
"i really thought this was going to be another basic, boring strategy game. i was wrong.",59.1
"best rts game ever. first one ive played was tzar, and that was a long time ago. this is so much better. 5 stars",114.2
"if you have any experience with civilization games previously, do yourself a favor and buy the complete version of this that includes gods and kings and brave new world. the dlc for this game takes what was otherwise an okay, but kind of pared down and boring version of civ, and turns it into the best civ game since alpha centauri. other things of note if you are an older civ player looking at this game: - units are restricted to (basically) one unit per tile. at first this seems terrible, but in the long run youll wonder why you ever put up with stacks of doom. - instead of squares, you have hexes. this increases the strategic depth of the game a lot. - india will still nuke the hell out of you the first chance they get.",429.9
"holy ing  this is one of the best ing games ive ever played in my entire ing life.",78.5
"quite frankly, few attributes of games ellicit such anger and discontent as those found rampantly within the broken and consistently inconsistent formula that constitutes this game, civilization v. other games offer more refined methods, with more visually and mechanically sophisticated gameplay options than can ever be conceived of within this joke of a strategy game.",72.0
"it is really fun, highly reccomend it, even if you have never played a turn based strategy. it has very helpful tooltips to help you learn the game.",60.1
"i grew up on civ and this is another great installment.",117.2
"someone wanted my borders to open so i took all of their cities",30.4

"if you want something to do with friends this is the game for you",377.4
"definitely a fun game if you like turn-based strategy. if you like any of the total war games this is a pretty fun alternative.",17.0
"im a big fan of civ games, and this one i like the most. stacks of doom are gone at last :)",986.0
"civilization 5 is awsome gamme for thos how like stretige.",268.8
"best strategy game ever. dont underestimate it - its amazing.",137.4
"i hated all prior civilization games. maybe they changed, or maybe i changed. whatever happened, i enjoyed this one.",157.7
"very fun and well made turn based strategy. lacks a bit on variety departement, still 9/10.",29.6
"this is the first game of its type that i have really dove into. to put it simply, its addictive. the ability to play with historical events and mismatch monuments and wonders is always fun. as far as gameplay is concerned, ill say this. ive put over 150hrs into this game and im still learning new things. its as deep as it is complex. dl all the expansions too, they are worth it. especially brave new world.",324.3
"im a megalomanic with a penchant for history so this game is right up my alley.",166.6
"never played any civ game. tried today and dindt stop playing for 4 hours straight.the singleplayer its a very low pace game (at least i think it is), and i think thats great because it gives you time to learn the game. you should try it.",25.5
"what other game could i say i defeated julius caesar with giant death robots ? excellent game that allows thoughtful and even sometimes maniacal crushing of another civilisation. a possible downside would i felt mid-way through a campaign i was merely next turn ing until my society had advanced to a powerful state.",167.6
"ive only played for about 2,450 hours, but even from that one match, i can tell this is an amazing strategy game. from the first annoying barbarian raids, to the last annoying ghandi nukes, youll be on the edge of your seat asking questions like, i wonder what my family look like? and how old am i now? truly a stunning gaming experience. too much water. 7.8/10",97.0
"it allows me to stab my friends in the back and crush their hopes and dreams, good game 10/10",93.2
"apparently this game has the ability to speed time up... 10/10",12.4
"i love civ! definitly worth buying however multiplayer games dont get finished often because this game can suck away hours of your life and not everyone in the game wants to spend 8 consecutive hours playing. so if you find yourself with an extra 8hrs of nothing pop a squat :)",430.0
"a really fun game to play, used to play this on the xbox (the xbox version) which i used to play all the time when i could or had time, i highly recommend this game to you all if you like long endurance games, where you start of with a group of settlers and grow your empire to be the strongest and rule the world.",75.4
"gods & kings creates and interesting wrinkle. and brave new worlds... bravo... so glad to see caravans back. they are a real boon to getting new cities up and running, especially when either food or production is some what limited. caravan in hammers to help small cities produce wonders that create bonus culture for city border growth.",606.8
"fun game to play, if you have the time for it. playing this game you need to make sure you have plenty of time to lose. a single game can range anywhere from 3 hours to 12 hours. its a great game where there are many avenus to victory and you have all the power to choose which one you want. definatly a game to pick up!",29.3
"this is a fantastic game with bnw. this is an alright game with g&k. this is a flatout broken game with vanilla.",555.9
"civilization v is an unparalleled 4x strategy game with many great systems contributing to an amazing experience. the randomly generated map and many different play styles ensure unique experiences every time you play. the social policy trees further distinguish each game you play in it from the others with many different combinations. contributing even further to this uniqueness is the sheer number of civilizations each with its own unique ability. a final factor contributing to its impressive variety is the many different victories players can go for. one of the few cons in this game i have to say is its addictiveness, it is nearly impossible to stop a game before you finish it.",574.1
"this game is so much fun, theres just something special about razing cities and demanding tribute",76.5
"if you are planning on having an early night. dont play this game. ill go to my bed at 11 ahh its 12:30 ill go at 1am hmm its 1;05am may aswell stay until 2am *girlfriend comes in* its 7am where you and your friend up all night?",19.0

"right after i bought this damn game it went back down price son of a gun",43.8
"man this game is addicting. its a great turn based strategy game, and it is very refined too. youll have fun and learn some history along the way. but read the fine print: this product can cause dependence! lol",25.6
"civ v is one of those games that you cant really say no to. as a turn based strategy made by the famous sid meier, this game lives up to the name of civilization. although ive encountered a few, but rare bugs in the game (such as a ship magically jumping into a lake from the sea) this game is a game you cant put down, you spend hours on it because you want to see what happens in just one more turn, what you can accomplish. 5/5 id say for this game. i recommend it to anyone from every part of the gaming spectrum",30.3
"in my opinion, civ v with the latest dlcs is the best civ to date. exceptional re-playability, trophies, entertainment and balance. of course it has been around long enough to hone itself to near perfection. easily recommended for any 4x gamer who somehow has never heard of civ or sid meier.",592.3
"a game that takes an hour and turns it into a week. this is a great strategy game that sucks your time like your mom did last night.",18.2
"finally ive finished my first game of this. i dont know why but i had never finished a full game before. i loved it. i won through points.",47.2
"yeah you should probably buy this game. seriously. do it.",569.5
"the trick, is to kill ghandi as soon as possible. dont let his cute inocence fool you, wipe him out before he gets the chance to get too close to you. though people will think of you as a warmonger it is worth it, it will save you. anyways great game 13/10.",136.7
"first of all i would like to warn you all that this game is highly addictive. anyway this game is a great strategy game in which you have to lead various civilizations from ancient times all the way to the future and develop your towns/cities. there is various ways to win the game which are all interesting. you can also play local multiplayer and online multiplayer matches. i would rate this game 10/10. (dont trust gandhi.)",24.4
"i opened the game and didnt close it for the next 10 hrs... this game is awesome! i play alot with 2-3 friends and it is great to just chill with while building your empire and making your grand strategies to take down your enemies. civ 5 has so many different elements to it that it is hard to understand at first if you have not played a civ game before it but when you begin to understand the game you can scratch the surface of what the game has to offer. great game, would recommend playing with friends and getting the brave new world expansion at least.",25.1
"good strategy game,it will consume time without you realizing",31.2
"awesome game that will keep you saying one more turn.",485.4
"if you are new to the civilization franchise, do not let the complexity of the game turn you off. this is a very addictive game and once you get the basics down, you will keep coming back. with all of the different maps and leaders the game is never the same twice. just watch your time, because this is the type of game you can play for hours and not realize it.",115.0
"4 **** i struggle to understand a lot of civs concepts but i can recognize a good game when i see it. this title has a lot going for it, its better than 4 in my opinion. so if you like this sort of thing give it a go.",75.2
"civilization v is sort of like a time machine.. you start playing friday night ---> you look up and its saturday morning.",141.2

"this game is so addicting... just a sec gotta finish my turn first.... its absolutely amazing, its the best game ive ever played :d (to my opinion then)",550.7
"such a fun game. i enjoyed every hour i played its really in depth and theres alot of strategy that goes into it. overall 10/10",224.2
"all in all it was a fantastic game, i loved every minute.",35.1
"rescued a city form the french... gave the city back to them... expected them to worship me... dethroned me 10/10",27.1
"its fun fun fun and more fun. you will play the whole day and you will still want more siv.",214.7
"more addictive than cocaine. 10/10 would press next turn button again!",95.7
"it is a nice change from civ iv. not being able to stack a massive force on one tile made taking cities an actual challenge rather than a massacre. the religion aspect of the game is interesting, sometimes accepting another nations religion is actually better for you. the city states were helpful for the most part, but sometimes they would just spawn in a terrible area that would make settling annoying, especially when they pretty much surround your capitol. the detail of the tiles and cities was nice, even zooming up close they still had good detail. in the end i personally rate this game a 3.9/5",93.1
"a great game for lovers of stratagy, be warned there is no such thing as a quick game so be prepared to invest alot of hours into it. (oh and be careful of ghandi, if he can nuke you by god he will.)",362.7
"complex and challenging with variable difficulty setting. i have yet to begin getting into this game. it is a good fun challenge.",3.1
"feels like ive spent years playing this game and still havent used half the available civs. not to mention ive barely touched the scenarios. definitely a time sink with high replayability.",187.8
"so many late nights have been spent in this game. civilization v is perfect for newcomers to the civilization franchise. aswell as still having many of the core features that makes long time fans love the games.",326.8
"this game steals your life... best game... spending atleast 40 hours a week :l",118.1
"awesome, immersive game that gives you lots of control over your empire. ive been a fan of the civilization series since civilization ii.",238.1

"time flies in this game, i need to buy diapers to conquer the world",94.8
"this is a very entertaining strategy game. hours and hours of game play.",46.7
"i sincerely suck at this game, but its still fun.",744.7
"civ remains the end all, be all of country simulations, especially because you dont have to win through force: the scientific space race is here as always, along with diplomatic and cultural victories, and these separations really make each country feel distinct. i havent played a civ game in years, so i cant speak to folks talking about how 5 here is in some ways inferior to 4. from what ive seen i think they were trying to simplify some of the more mundane aspects, like plotting roads, with more broad strokes. i think its pretty spiffy keen- even without me bonnie scotland - and thats saying something.",100.8
"i played this game for hours!!! one of the best 4k games i have ever played + it is one of the best strategy games! i recommend it to everyone",160.6
"ill just play for an hour or so. 8 hours pass. omfg! im gonna be late for work!",169.4
"i remember being captivated by civ1 back in high school while at a friends house. when civ2 was released, it dropped my college gpa possibly a whole point - it was that good. civ5 has taken the franchise to new heights. most of the annoyances are gone and there are many new facets of gameplay to explore like the faith system. im a little late to this game - its been out for a while but i really regret not purchasing this game earlier.",105.4
"nice game, worth the money. dlcs are very nice, adding alot to the game. endless replay ability. if you enjoy strategy games, youve come to the right one.",110.2
"about to reach 400 hours in this game. i guess you could say its okay.",572.1
"i have a hard time not falling into the same path everytime with this game>start civ with goal>abandon goal for shiny wonders>lose to other civ due to lack of ingame points. but, ive spent a lot of hours doing that same exact thing whilst having fun, so this game must be doing something right. 9.5/10",212.4

"france asked me to go to war with the celts then denounced me for war mongering. 10/10 would recommend",84.3
"if you want an epic, extremely well thought out, well executed game, play this. my friend, who is a major civ junkie, says that civ iii is really the height of the civ series, but from my experience i can say with complete confidence that civ v is totally an incredible game. you have thousands of little levers you can pull to try to make your empire as powerful, inspiring, and in general as amazing as possible, and they all really immerse you into the experience. plus, you can learn a ton about history from the little articles theyve put into the information book in the game. one thing to mention: the game is completely different with the dlc. and playing really is ideal with both expansions. if you can get this with both of them, youre going to enjoy the game a lot more.",79.0
"expansion packs are mandatory, but when you get them this is a great and totally addictive game. definitely a must have for any pc gamer.",256.0

"this is an amazing turn base strategy game that keeps you craving for more. ive always loved this game. i would recomend this game and its worth every penny.",152.5
"i must warn you. this game is dangerous. dont buy this game if you have a family. dont buy this game if you need to go to work. dont buy this game if you need sleep. i failed everytime when i tried to quit. there are so many nations you could choose and each nation you need to fine tune your strategy to win the game. thats very interesting. not a single game is the same. the ai is good (though i think not as good as in civilization iv) and the interface is intuitive. the tutorial is quite helpful even a newcomer could enojy the game within minutes. i kept playing civilization iv until v was released. i think i will keep playing civilization v until vi is out.",519.3
"this game alone is amazing. i have always loved this genre of games, i remember being very young and playing age of empires 2 and 3. well, theres that and then there is civ. its amazing the amount of customization that is available to the player. you can quite literally be the leader you choose to be and if when you win you waant to change that you can always continue playing after you win. however, i do recommend that you get brave new world expansion as it adds things to the game that make the game seem so much more superior when you are using it.",235.5
"highly, fun turn base easy to understand and hours and hours of play.",188.3
"there are mods to be the lord of the rings guys and the code geass characters. btw..... code geass won 10/10 would mind control again",28.4
"really enjoy playing this game with friends. only trouble is sometimes there is connection troubles with the civ servers.",110.4
"its a classic, just the newest time through. if you like being the leader, the one calling the shots... for seeing a plan or strategy come to life as you work through it, its a great game. and while on previous editions i never got around to it, multiplayer with this game and its expansions can be a lot of fun with friends.",210.3
"i love this iteration of civ. i bought the gold pack with extra civs and maps. it has enough depth to keep you coming back again and again. but its simple enough for anyone to get started and play. i like having control over the advanced setup and choosing or limiting modes of victory to change things up. i play civ5 many times more than my other games. you can choose to make the games quick or mathons. either way you can always sit down for a few turns when you have the time, and save the rest for later. this is a very versatile game setup that allows you to customize almost anything. whether you are new to civ, or a domination monster, i highly recommend this game.",607.9
