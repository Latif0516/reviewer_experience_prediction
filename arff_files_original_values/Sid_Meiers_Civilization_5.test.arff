"its turn 386 and i have no clue what i am doing. 65.2/10",85.5
"this game is probably one of the best games ive ever played! it is probably one of the best strategy ever made that is why it gets a 10/10 from me! :d",193.9
"a game about growing cities and giant people and animals that protect them. gandhi nukes/10",185.5
"civ 5 is very addictive since brave new world came out. the ai can be buggy and the game can have some balacing issues, but its not enough to distract from how much i love this game.",1045.2
"this is one of my all time favorite games. it will keep you up til early next morning...",89.4
"relatively simple gameplay, yet surprisingly addictive (hence my 385 hours of gametime logged playing it). although a good game at launch, the two expansion packs released since do add a lot of depth to the gameplay and i would recommend purchasing the expansion packs if possible.",547.7
"10/10 will drain all of your energy and social life into a dark void never to be retrieved again because that would require you getting off this game.",67.0
"wow - what a fun game - the replayability is great. im well over 200 hours on this one and its new every time. keep the expansion packs going..",788.2
"its very good if you are into startegy games and that make you think. recomend this with the expantion packs. totally worth it.",104.3
"beginning to ruin my life. 11/10. would nuke ghandi again.",29.6
"awesome stragetic gameplay if you see this then buy this and you will be an happy man... or woman",42.3
"its civilization... just be sure to keep an eye on the clock ;)",123.1
"this is a great game! its less complex than its predecessor, civilization iv, which serves to make the game a lot easier to learn and progress in. i highly reccomend downloading the gold edition and brave new world dlcs as well, as these prove to completely revolutionize the game. unlike most other games dlcs, these serve to completely revamp the game and make it an even more enjoyable experience. pick a civilization, load a game, and build an empire to stand the test of time!",540.3
"protip to hex editors, to find your gold value, multiply by 100.",181.5
"well... over 18 hours into the game, and i barely have finished the tutorial and 1 game. need i say more ? alright. apart from its extensive playtime, the gameplay mechanics are excellent, the game is very easily modable (thanks to steam workshop, you can play campains on wwii, lord of the rings, game of thrones and so on), easy to set up as you want, a game can last (from what ive seen) between 10mn and 9+ hours, im sure this is even not a lot compared to what you can do. the mechanics are really easy to learn, but seem to be hard to master. and once you grow tired of being pwned by the computer, you can also get pwned by other players online ! thats wonderful. this game is truly a masterpiece, and should be in every strategy fan library !",40.5
"awesome game. keeps me seated for tens of hours and i havent tried out expansion packs. i definetly recommend this to everyone, who likes to relax, yet focus on strategy. turn based system works really well.",15.8
"as i sat there. i thought to myself, how did this happen? it was me versus my friend. he had pikemen. i thought uh oh and then suddenely out of nowhere my fighter plane came and shot at him then i nuked all five of his cities at once. he cried for three days after that. 10/10 would nuke again",153.4
"played for over 8 hours straight and didnt finish one game",22.0
"such an underrated game that nobodys ever heard of!! good thing i wrote this review to get the word out.",203.5
"ive been hooked on civilization since i played civ 2 on my aunts computer... waited hours to download freeciv in the 90s on dialup in the middle of the night, played that until civ iv came on sale in the 00s. played that until i got civ v as part of a bundle. i thought civ iv was better at first, but there is something to be said for the tactics of civ v that require you to carefully place your units around a city to take it. and think before overrunning too many cities and plunging your empire into revolt. i find myself winning diplomatically more often than conquest now because i enjoy manipulating the city-states with intrigue and finishing their quests, consequently getting all their votes when they start voting in the un. there is also something to be said for the some simplifications over civ iv. also, with brave new world its pretty solid!",335.7
"ive really enjoyed playing civ v so far. as far as im concerned, its like a much fancier version of the old risk board game we all used to play. if you dont like rtss, id still recommend you give this one a shot. i thought i wouldnt like it, but after i gave it a shot it was really fun.",98.7
"awesome multi-player game. lots of fun with friends.",30.3
"so,there you are,trying to win a civ 5 game in prince difficulty,but always giving up midgame cause you are a really sore loser.after about 200 hours of raging in single player and some really sweet diplomatic victories in multiplayer,divide and conquerstyle,you finally start a single player game,where you like capture 10 ruins and make a wonderful start. triumphly looking at your prosperous empire,you notice those warmongering assyrian neighbors of yours killing arabs,but considering the fact that assyria is trying to be-friends with you, you turn a blind eye. and so,20 turns later,when the assyrian s have backstabbed you,and are now running wild inside your empire cause you were too cheap to buy any military units,you calmly look at the advancing army,with only one thought in your head... hm.gandhi did worse.",266.4
"dis game iz da shizaye u waz gon 2 work bat wayz funna ! bye it yo",279.0
"when it comes to losing entire days over a weekend glued to your screen ... civ is at the top of the list... in reality, after years of playing civ through its various generations, civ 5 now sits at the level sofistication that the developers had to leave planet earth to take a step forward... literally.",592.4
"a friend had told me about civilization for a while now, and i finally decided to pick it up during the summer sale. glad i did! civ is an awesome game so far and i literally instantly got hooked on it the first time i played. multiplayer is amazing so far even with just playing with one friend. awesome game!",140.6
"i love this game....ive always been a huge fan of civ games, and this one is just as good!",41.3
"great game. logged 30+ hours on one game. plan to go back for more",79.5
"sid meiers civilization v is an amazing game in which you start off by selecting the leader of a country, you will play as that leader, each country has different attributes and units which help them start off the game, after selecting a world to play in you will spawn with a settler and a warrior, (may change depending on leader of choice). the warrior is there to protect your settler which you need to found your first city, a capital city. as you go through the game you find other world leaders, barberians and city-states, you will face war with all of them, diplomacy with two of them and everything inbetween. in the end civ v is one of the most entertaining games i have played in a long while and has massive replay value! 9/10",128.5
"it is currently not my favorite of the series, but still a good game. i do not yet have the expansions but i intend to purchase them and i understand that they improve the game.",32.7
"great strategy game provides fun gameplay even for peolpe that dont play strategy games that much.",286.9
"i have a very soft spot for the civilization series. civilization iii, is, to my memory, the first game i ever played. i have since played 2, the snes version of the original, and this. like the rest of the series, its decently polished, easy to learn, has a lot of depth, and is periliously addictive. i didnt get into it as much as i did iii, but thats probably just nostalgic bias. if i had to complain, i would say that the diploacy is rather limited, and not being able to trade communications blows. thankfully, the rest of the game does it. also, i nuked beijing eleven times in a row, and it still stood, with two citzens who refused to die, district 13 style. 11/10.",35.5
"this game is fun. i like to build a gret nation to take over the world. i build mummies and zombies and no one can touch. i would recommend this game to child or adults. all races and black people.",132.4
"never ever play this game again. you have been warned ! 11/10 addicting, destroy my university life -1/10 dont play again.",30.5
"i cant recommend this game highly enough. there are so many different ways to play, to win and to lose. not to mention the virtually limitless replay value.",66.3
"you will lose hours in this game. make sure to have a toilet near by, chips at your hand, and a soda or drink near you. sleep? who needs it. world domination!",57.5
"while i love the game, i wish they wouldve captured the personality of the leaders more in actual gameplay. ghandi gets pretty aggressive, and im pretty sure he didnt roll like that.",67.0
"time flies as one heads up one great civilization after another. for an old-school civ-player, all this religion and diplomacy malarkey can get a bit hectic and feels a bit foreign at first, but it definitively adds to the atmosphere of the game. it is a well-balanced turn-based strategy game with an incredible amount of content. i have only managed to win at king once and it took some thinking in the end-game. success is not always guaranteed, but a few setbacks along the way arent necessarily fatal. recommended for anyone with a fair bit of spare time on their hands. its addictive nature rarely allows for just a quick five minutes... type of play, but that is part of its timeless charm.",154.5
"this game provides a very different form of entertainment than most other simulator games. sid meier has captured the perfect combination of war, science, culture, and economy. you can win by taking over the world, reaching alpha centauri, sending a space shuttle into space via the apollo program, or by building the united nations. the only word that i can possibly sum this game up with would be wow.",93.9
"great but takes a long time and might get boring after consecutive sessions.",28.6
"best series of games ever, bar none. sid meier rules.",964.5
"great game easy to pick up and play **warning** will consume your life",627.6
"burn countless hours of your life away with this fantastic game.",44.4
"pretty fun game. great for those who crave power and bloodshed. oh and diplomacy. but betraying your friends in order to destroy them and claim their lands is great fun.",279.1
"with g&k, this is an incredibly fun game. founding and spreading religions, spying, and conquering has really improved from the last games.",116.2
"i really enjoyed this game. cant wait for beyond earth.",101.2
"great game, you have to understand the game is great!!!!!! but if you dont know how to play, dont give up instantly... actually try to learn it. if you dont know what youre doing youll love it.",434.7
"good game in general. take the world by force or make it yours through diplomacy. a very good game for people with a lot of time on their hands. i deeply recommend it for people who likes strategy games. problably the best one out there in my opinion, but it is missing ways to win. but with the expansion-pack brave new world, you can win in a cultural way too. 9/10. 10/10 if you have the brave new world expansion.",267.0
"this game is so addictive and can be played for hours and hours on end.",119.2
"great game. you can get lost in it for a long time.",891.9
"dooooppe. only thing that could be better is if the tech lines werent so direct.",101.0
"simply a perfect game. buy the game, play it and be happy!",468.4
"starting a game before bed is like playing russian roulete, either your wife notices your missing and calls you to bed or you dont sleep that night. 20 homicidle ghandis out 10",89.9
"a wonderful way to spend a full weekend with friends. immersive gameplay and fun for hours.",456.7
"ok sid this game is nice and all but youre not getting any of those dlc funbux from me until multiplayer ing works",36.5
"one of my favorite games of all time! truly adicting hours of entertainment. the most fun playing a multiplayer game i have ever had! the game does have some connection issues using muliplayer.",192.7
"simply put, this is one of the best games ive ever played. even with the vanilla civ v, i spent countless hours playing just one more turn. with gods and kings and the brave new world expansions, the game only got better. i paid full price for almost all the civ v dlcs and expansions, but it was worth it --- and i have more than 600 hours of playing time to prove it. ive had the sun rise on me many, many times, whether playing civ v alone or with friends. the depth and complexity of this game ensures that every playthrough will be different, every decision interesting. and as if the game isnt nearly perfect already, it still gets improvements 4 years after its initial launch! this game is a true classic, a standard by which other games of its kind will always be measured and is a must-have for any strategy game lover.",601.0
"awesome game, wasted 140 hours of my life fighting montezuma!",172.1
"super fun strategy game. ive played a lot of strategy games trying to find one that satisfies and i keep coming back to this one. the only dlc that i purchased was the brave new world and it has pretty much everything i needed.",11.1
"delivers as expected, a must have for any civ player.",747.7
"this is a great game, you win if you focus on science",71.2
"this game was a bust at the begining. but the 2 expension make it wothwhile. for sure, everything is streamline. it minimize the micromanagement. unfortunatly, at the higher level of play the ai is not better, it just get some bonus over the player. overall a good buy when on special.",675.6
"i cant stop playing. send help. also, never trust the ai. ever.",458.0
"this game is my favourite turn based strategy game i have ever play i would recommend this game to anyone who is in to any type of strategy game and has never played this.",6.4
"good game. the best thing compared to civ4: the improved combat system. game design took the direction of turning the franchise from an empire building simulation game, into a dumbed down strategy game the thing i didnt like.",90.7
"this is a game about time. not time travel, but time as a currency. because trust me, the money you spend on this game is not the full price. it is a down payment. the real price is the sheer amount of time you will spend playing it. a single game will take you all day. this game is a time vampire. play at your own risk. oh, and you build cities on landmasses and fight wars and stuff. or something.",138.3
"really fun. it just get better with friends online too. perfect if you have the time for a good marathon game.",62.3
"civilization v is one of those few games that is enjoyable whether youre playing alone, with friends, with people you dont know or even passing it around with people at your house, its just a fun game. the amount of different scenarios that can happen is infinite, and as you progress you have this feeling of being a world leader, which is very satisfying and is something i have never seen delivered successfully in a game. you can be what you want, whether it be a nuclear war-lord, or a peace-seeking nation the game is always fun. you can choose to start at the beginning of civilization, and a huge selection of different iconic eras such as the medieval, renessance, ancient, etc. or you can even start in modern times, or in the future to come. every game you play lays down new options of how you want to go about doing things, keeping it fresh and fun. a great investment.",164.0
"great game, many hours lost to it. i cannot comment on this vs the previous releases as i have not really played them.",97.7
"this is a good strategy-turnbased game were you start as a great leader of a civilization. even though it is a very good game by it self i would recomend getting th expansion pack brave new world as it adds lots of new and interesting content",31.3
"i created a new religion. i named it agnosticism and now it is spreading everywhere.",10.5
"i didnt think this was going to be my thing, but after realease i had missed two meals while doing my first playthrough it became obvious how well-made this game is. if you like anything about history, turn-based games, or simcity - but dont like cities - then this is the game for you.",14.1
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played. i have loved all of the sid meiers games and this one is the best to me. the dlc would make this game entirely out of this world. the only game of this type i think could top this is distant worlds only because... micro managing rawr",97.1
"a must-have for every strategy fan. diplomacy system is a bit ... meh.",81.7
"speaking from the perspective of someone whos never played the earlier civilization games here. the stories about civ 5 being a great time sink are incredibly true, but i find myself somewhat hard pressed to start up a new game after sinking a lot of time into my first game. just dont expect to be able to please everybody, and dont expect to be able to do all there is to do in a single campaign, and you should do just fine.",184.6
"great game. an rts version of this would be cool, 9/10.",17.1
"this is currently my favorite and most played game of all time at over 800 hours. i got this game in a humblebundle at my friends request. best $12 ever spent.",1072.9
"dont play with friends, theyll stab you in the back as soon as you start winning.",251.3
"i have a hard time not falling into the same path everytime with this game>start civ with goal>abandon goal for shiny wonders>lose to other civ due to lack of ingame points. but, ive spent a lot of hours doing that same exact thing whilst having fun, so this game must be doing something right. 9.5/10",212.4
"sid meier has made another masterpiece! this is a great game! say goodbye to productivity if you buy this game!",14.6
"really fun game for war strategy and on top of that it gives alot of interesting facts from that time",79.3
"two huge thumbs up, especially for the complete edition. civ v offers limitless playability as well as an incredibly fun and in-depth experience. games will take a long- time and you will love every second. play against your friends over the (quite solid) multiplayer to make the experience even more fun. dominate other cultures, rush whatever technologies you see fit, get nuked by gandhi, nuke your city-state allies... civ gives you the freedom to be as much of an  to the rest of the world as you want. or you could be a nice guy and win a diplomatic victory (borrrring). i suggest trying to buy the game while it is on sale (summer sale is a great option, but its been on sale twice in the past year) as it is a little pricey. if you have to pay the full $50 for the complete edition, however, it is still worth it. really amazing game, 10/10.",257.8
"its an amazing game with a large modding community. if you havent got this game, you should get it when onsale.",69.2
"turn based strat game. lots of fun even when i lose!",492.8
"if youre looking for an awesome time sink, look no further. 10/10 would recommend. simply: awesome.",43.1
"this game is fantastic...there is so much depth and content.",225.0
"never play this game before but thr first time i spend time more 10 hrs. !!",16.9
"an amazing game. only get it if you have a decent monitor size however, its no fun trying to play on a laptop. so many good mods as well.",443.8
"if you are in university and need to write an essay due tomorrow do not launch this game. the whole one more turn is just your brains way of justifying the last 6 hours you spent on this game 10/10 goty",12.1
"have sank many hours into this game - a rich world and complex strategy game. flaws: multiple playthroughs can be repetitive. ai civilizations are often unpredictable, often declaring war on yours for no tangible reason, despite previous cooperation. i am told that the dlc packs go some way to fixing this.",208.1
"game for all occasions! but, be prepared to put some serious hours every time you play. with the addition of brave new world, the already great game became greater.",125.6
"my friends told me not to go japan. i went japan and we lost our friendship. 10/10 would lose more friends again!",47.6
"this is an excellent game. buy it twice, just so you know whats what.",272.8
"my chair broke from siting 4 so long 11/10 ign <>< find nemo 3 cuntfirmed",43.5
"good game to pass the time and some depth in strategie. online is terrible.",71.3
"good game. the best thing compared to civ4: the improved combat system. game design took the direction of turning the franchise from an empire building simulation game, into a dumbed down strategy game the thing i didnt like.",90.7
"i really love this game, it has great replayability, graphics and music. (for replayability just look at the hours on my profile lol.)",275.2
"im pretty terrible at this game apparently, but its still a lot of fun. just dont start playing unless you have appoximately 1 full day put aside for a campaign. its so hard to stop playing once you start.",117.8
"a game you can spend hours playing and feel like youve accomplished nothing.",278.9
"if you think youve wasted enough time, and you havent played civ, then there is clearly alot of time left to be wasted. alot of time.......alot. of. time. all of the time.",59.9
"probably the best game i own. many hours spent on this wonderful game. not only the gameplay, but also the amazing community. 10/10",341.5
"i swear to the gods; get this game and you will fail all of your college classes. so oviously you should get it",491.3
"awesome game. the strategies change based on the expansions you get so i would recommend buying the whole thing in one go so you only have to learn once. ive played a lot and even more offline. its yet to get old.",52.9
"civilization v is like crack cocaine, you dont want to stop, but you know you have to. once you finally stop, a friend drags you back in and then youre stuck. its literally and endless cycle of joy and shame. i cant stop. i wont stop.",143.5
"probably the best sid meier game yet. i would recommend this for anyone who like a plot line in their game, this has all kinds of technologies you can research plus alot more. i really enjoy this game.",66.9
"im not usually a fan of 4x games, but civilization v managed to grab my interest and kept me pressing the next turn button over and over again. definitely get on discount.",4.4
"boring as hell, every game goes the exact same and the computer just steamrolls over you.",71.6
"a truly awesome and addictive game. once you pick it up, you cannot put it down and you cannot stop thinking about it when you take a little break from it. one sunday morning i decided to play it. once i finished up, i realised my day was gone. the game is somewhat slow, but i hear its dlc brave new world speeds it up a bit. i find no cons in this game. 10/10",259.3
"amazing bringing back good old fun turn base games, with updated graphics, storylines for each playable race is amazing.",152.4
"day 249 its been so long since i have seen the light. i sometimes wonder if i will ever again see my friends, my family, and society. im low on food rations, but perhaps if i replace those trade posts with farms around the river, ill be able to eat again. i have approximately $50.00 left in my reserves... i already know what i must do. buy the complete edition. this is perhaps the last time humanity may hear of me, so this will be my goodbye letter. i want my loved ones to forgive me... but i regret nothing. i have tasks to do. my main task as of now is to completely ravage then dominate russia. that backstabbing witch!... *sighs* my german utopia towers over each empire. no one stands a chance. soon...",768.6
"wery good game but europe universal is much bether",14.2
"premium title that is fun, civ is the standard for turn based strategy games.",1029.1
"not as good as civ 4 was, but still great in its own right. if you havent played a civilization game before, try out the demo. if you dont like the demo, get civ 4 instead. if you have played civilization before, well then... its ing civilization! what more do you need to know?",401.1
"wow...where can i start? this game is the definition of my childhood. i purchased this game at age 13 and holy hoot! its been a year since ive owned this game! i reccomend playing with a couple of friends and either game against each other or blast off to victory together! on this games releases it was riddled with bugs and glitches but since then they have patched them all. its incredible how much the dlcs add to the game, you can catch this gem on sale often times with dlcs. i personally think this game was extremely overlooked and not really noob-friendly. this game is best with dlcs and a conquering mind set. dont overlook this diamond in the ruff!",37.9
"this  pretty tight its like an asian girl with big boobs just very suprising and underrated",357.1
"takes a really long time to play, but its pretty worth it if youve got some friends to play it with.",34.8
"only had this game for a week and i already have 42 hours on it, my second game was a 18 hours straight game so in other words say goodbye to you social life once you start a game :)",114.6
"the late-game portion of civilization games has always been a weak point in the series. often, during the middle ages, it becomes obvious which player will win the game. as well, managing a large empire with many cities can become overwhelming. luckily they addressed this problem in civilzation 5 by making the late-game run so slowly, its essentially unplayable!",227.2
"a great game really fun and addictive but the game seems to crash a lot.",45.3
"excellent game! i have played the civ series from from the the dos era to today...a must for any strategy player",715.6
"one of the best strategi (turn based) game ever, and in civilization v, you can do a lot more then previous games, not only more civilizations, units, buildings, wonders but aswell new cultural victory, international trade routes, world congress, policies, ideologies, religion, diplomacy, espionage, naval combat, city states, and a lot more, what are you waiting for ? world domination by your hand is waiting... (psst, at least try the demo !) official site :",83.0
"epic, the dlcs turn the game into a brand new one..... as good if not better than civ 4",199.0
"a great strategy game that is easy to play singleplayer or with others, and very easy to pick up on.",52.5
"get it deffinately!! this game is very addicting. i have playe it for 60+ hours, and i have never gotten bored with it! this game will lag a little when pressing next turn, even in singleplayer, but thats the kind of thing that cant be avioded (the game has got to catch up). over all, this is an amazing game and everyone should play it. the multiplayer is especially fun, because you can chat with you friends, and how you need to defeat greece with cannons, and how you repeatedly put tading posts over all over your land until your cities start to stave. id say, if you dont hav this game, you should. if you can get it when it is on sale, then you weil get way more than you paid for. you will play this for at leas 30 hours, lways trying to kill that last unit, or take that last city. plus, if anything else, you can show this to your history teacher :p",77.2
"dont play this late at night, or you will be up until 5 a.m. trust me.",48.1
"i love this game but i suspect it may be a time machine. i have started many a game before bed and before i even have the chance to notice it is already morning.",159.2
"this a good one. maybe this is where my life went.",225.5
"great game, effectively endless replay value. can choose so many paths for your civilization to follow. well worth getting",76.3
"i cant even count how many times i said id play a short game of civilization v and landed up staying up all night! its just that addicting.",47.6
"this game is the reason i have no friends, no money and no home. 11/10 would get nuked by gandhi again.",414.2
"builds a great civilazation by the 1900s, have countless wonders and a strong military, own two other civs capitols and friends with the rest. i enter a trade agreement with ghandi and give him some resources like gold and oil to help him out, ignoring the fascist ghandi stereotype everyone is complaining about. ghandi builds manhattan wonder in 1950 as soon as i press next turn ghandi declares war on me within 14 exact turns ghandi nukes 1/3 of my lands and resources and takes my capitol makes outrageous peace demands which takes almost all of my remaining gold and 2 of 4 of my remaining cities, doesnt want to lose, so i agree. in the next turn bismark declares war against me and in the following turns he takes the rest of my cities 15/10 would be decieved by ghandi again",91.5
"one more turn.... just one more turn... just one more-- oh, whats that? ive been here for four hours? oh well, im already running late, just one more turn shouldnt hurt... and maybe one more after that...",68.3
"this game is fantastic i love strategy games and this one is great the first time i played this i loved it, the game took some time to learn how to play good but with a little effort youll love this game i promise just expect a very long game when you try your first game, my first game lasted 3 days lull.",134.9
"buy this game and all of the dlc! a ton of fun and totally worth every cent! the more to play this with, the better it gets!",197.2
"i cannot recommend this game enough. no other game allows you to feel as powerful or amazing as this game. id recommend not having a job or anything though, it sucks time into it like a black hole.",510.0
"it allows me to stab my friends in the back and crush their hopes and dreams, good game 10/10",93.2
"very cool game, ive played about 10 hours worth and still have no clue what im doing, looking forward to seeing what i can do though :d",15.6
"ive logged so many hours on this game already and i see no signs of slowing down. now that ive convinced a couple of my friends to also buy this game, i also have the ability to play with them. i love this game!",591.8
"either you die as a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become a villian.",22.4
"if you buy this game you will lose your girlfriend, your job, and all your friends. be prepared... its just one more turn...",59.4
"once you buy this game and know how to play it your butt will stuck on a chair for a day .. 10/10",19.1
"so much fun, multi-player is pretty good and they are releasing extras to make it better.",736.0
"this is a really good strategy game. i bet the expansion packs make it even more epic. somewhat challeging to learn, but there are advisors that help you along the way. also, there is a good multiplayer option. i would totaly recommend this if you like stragety games and even if you dont, i would still recommend it.",130.7
"this game is great if you like the strategy type of city/civilization builders. *note* gandhi is a smug piece of . he will come to ruin you if you denounce him... even if you trust him hell stab you in the back. theres no winning with that jerk.",2.1
"great frekin game. a nice blend of cultures and is really fun to play with friends.",52.8

"veterans of the civilizations franchise may be immediately put off by the lack of features in this hexagonal iteration, but the expansions (gk+bnw) add a lot of content back and steam frequently has them for sale. to be honest the smaller scale of warfare due to 1-army-per-square and reduced warfare abilities in general as a result put me off at first. however, i really came to appreciate how much more significant country borders became as a result of this, making each expansion risky due to quick flanking maneuvers by the ai. i still think the ai for civ is still too predictable and even when set on random, a bit harsh depending on your difficulty level. still recommend the game for fans and newcomers, you will easily end up spending way more time than you thought carving your perfect civ.",132.1
"its the turning point of this war. the battle for the south ends with just 3000 of my infantry surviving. we make camp, heal up, and march to shanghai. the final battle looms over the distance, though shanghai hasnt recruited soldiers in a while, what are they building? burned down a city full of jews cos io couldnt be bothered to have my religion compete with judaism in that city. build new city right on that spot a day after burning it down",209.8
"an amazing game, great graphics, and an easy to learn layout. its one of those easy to learn, hard to master games. if you are a fan of turn based strategy games, you must get this game. but the at the highest level you will lose if you have no idea what your doing. but still an amazing experiance! 9.7/10 : non-stop fun!",164.8
"ive spent more hours of my life than id care to admit enjoying the hell out of this game. its not just entertaining, its kind of educational and makes me feel like im accomplishing something. watching my little town grow and expand, and then kicking the butt of some poor mongolions...its like crack. the interface is easy, the tutorial was simple and once you get into it you can dig into the finer details of the game, and will likely enjoy every minute of it.",76.9
"civ v is a slow-paced strategy game that has nearly infinite replayability. its even more fun if youre a history buff. ive played it vanilla, with the g&k expansion, and now with bnw, and these two expansions improve it significantly. i wouldnt recommend starting it up without at least g&k, its just a tad too barren without it, and religion is a really fun mechanism. dont be thrown by the initial complexity- civ is a game that will reward your attempts to figure it out.",343.2
"11/10 it is amazing to play with freinds or even alone i bought it in the summer sale of 2014 and plan to play hours on end of this game",13.6
"civilization v - its a game, where ghandy can start tomic war civilization v - its a game, where you can see pentagon and cia in moskow civilization v - its a game, where poland strong, and go to space) civilization v - its a game, where archers can destroy modern tank civilization v - its a game, where spearman can find tank details in the ancient ruins civilization v - its a game, where you can start playing russia in australia civilization v - its a game, where usa can be communist civilization v - its a game, where you can preach pastafarianstvo civilization v - its a great success!",72.3

"i cant help but try to win with a domination victory everytime i play this game. what is wrong with me....",229.8
"civilization v is a fascinating and addictive turn-based game that may be played either solo or multiplayer. the interface is simple and intuitive with plenty of on-screen prompting for most actvities. as you play, you will find such gems as queues for both building or research that help automate your exanding empire a bit, or the advisor panel which helps explain how things work while you are in-game. like any leader it might take a bit to know which advisor is giving you the most important imformation or information that you simply need to know. there are thoughtful comprehensive guides available which help even the newest player to begin to understand the complexities of this game.",344.0
"honestly, get this game! do not wait. it is amazing!",648.0
"excellent game especially with the gods and kings dlc",228.5
"one of my favorite games on steam. much improved from civ 4 and easier for the regular player to pick up if you like any kind of rts or city building game then this is for you. its basically a much simpler version of the total war games.",157.6
"game is pretty well done. the ai could use some work though",204.2
"tons of fun, if you have any thoughts on if you should get it or not, get it. it will engulf those meaningless hours that you used to use for doing productive things. great game all in alll, i would recommend purchasing the gold edition. 9/10",194.8
"one of the best strategy games of all time. would recommend to everyone.",371.4
"hours fly when you play this game,its funn and addictive but only whit the dlcs",261.9
"fun in depth game. if you dont like turned based games then this isnt for you. the dlcs expand the game alot and add alot more to it. you will learn to hate the world congress if you do not own it. and no matter what you do on the higher dificulties like imortal and diety, you will struggle. but you will go out with a bang. or you play lower level and are equal to everyone. or basic and destroy everyone",236.2
"there hasnt been a civ game that i havent played. this is one of my most favorite strategy games of all time. countless hours have been played through the years on the series but civ v has promoted itself to a special place in my gaming library. i cannot recommend that game enough. in fact it would be a great game to begin learning on rather than going through each of the other games. there are a few issues with this game though. it is a huge resource hog and will tax your computers hardware. especially after long periods of gameplay. multiplayer sessions can become corrupt and it is recommended to save as often as possible. even with those issue you should get this game. and all the dlc.",326.3
"very slow starting game, but thats what makes it great. chosing what your civ researchers first can help or hurt in the long run. its a new game everygame and games do take a long time to complete depending on the settings you chose. very fun does have mods for it. 8/10",57.3
"i havent played a civ game in years and this one makes it extremely easy to get back into the fold. it guides you along step by step to make it fun yet still challenging. replayability is obviously very high as the game is different with every playthrough.",126.9
"amazing game, even better when you play with friends. just pure class - tsg",64.7
"it is good, fun, exciting, and competitive, i would recommend anyday.",12.5
"long time civ fan, since the first game, all the way to new via colonization, alpha centauri, etc. civ iv with rise of mankind mod is still far superior. sadly, even with the expansions this is a much thinner experience, feels watered down. multiplayer is ok but doesnt make up for the lack of depth.",135.7
"set a timer when you play civ v. too many nights ive gone in thinking, ill just play a couple of turns then go to bed. four hours later i nearly crap my pants because the sun is coming up and i havent slept.",440.1
"the rule of the not more than one unit for each emplacement is totally silly. the possibility to buy units and buildings make the gameplay strange. the game is really boring, with no interest even in mp. the only interesting aspect and improvement is on the religious matter (but you need the dlc). civ4 is far, far, far better.",79.0
"i would love this game but it i get so far and it shuts down every time.",51.0
"you can play as a communist dictatoral ghandi who kills all and rules with an iron fist.",26.7

"surprisingly fun game, great to play with friends.",26.7
"my god is this game a beauty. i honestly have no explanation for how good it is other than nukes. exploration. conquest. 10/10",39.7
"i guess its ok but theres nothing really noteable about it",366.1
"have you ever sat down and wondered i want a game where all you have to do is make sandwiches for cats? well then you came to the wrong place, because this game will take you on a journey where every turn is a new adventure. you can destroy nations, launch nukes, make cats sandwiche- wait......... no, yeah thats right. so i recomend you pick up this game as soon as you can 2/10 would play again.",20.7
"warning: only play this game when you have run out of series to watch. when there are no more movies on your wishlist. when youve played every game in your library. be sure to set multiple alarms at 3 hour intervals. for when you start this game, 12 hours will pass without you noticing. you will completely miss the sunset. and sunrise. and wonder why youre hungry again, seeing as you just ate a large pizza. when in fact that was about 9 hrs ago. if you dont mind the loss of time. and love building your own empires, this might just be the game for you.",137.3
"best rts ever made, and in my personal top 10 games of all time. in civ 5, you assume the role of a past great leader, like washington, ghandi, queen elizabeth and so on. you rule and control their respective countries build your own empire. you do so by raging war, or making peace with others. i highly recommend buying at least the two major expansions. (gods & kings, and brave new world). theyre huge really game changing expansions. like adding religion to the game, which could mean the difference between friendship or nuclear war. as far as time goes, you start in the year 4000 bc (by default). and progress your empire through the ages all the way into the future. even though beyond earth (next entry in civ) is already on the horizon, civ 5 is a true masterpiece. buy this game now.",102.2
"extremely in-depth and a tremendous amount of fun solo, or with friends. i highly recommend picking this up, however, add it to your wishlist first because you can have steam email you when this goes on a sale which is every 2 minutes.",24.2
"definitely not a game you should start up when you have something important scheduled. you know, like... sleeping or eating. the just one more turn syndrome will keep ordinary things like these well out of your mind. try the marathon mode if you dare... the multiplayer mode used to be bit wonky but it pretty stable after the last patches. definitely get both expansions for the best experience (the complete edition is usually up for 10 bucks during the steam sales).",683.1
"im coming up to 100hrs in civ 5, so its probably about time i gave it some praise. make sure you get the complete edition on sale for around 8 in a sale. civ is a turnbased strategy game in which you build you empire across a randomly generated map. you compete against friends and ai to win the game, how you win is up to you. the game is at its best when its played in a boardgame night fashion with friends. get in google hangouts or mumble and chill out. the games last forever, so dont expect a quick fix. if you have 2 monitors the game gets even better when you can easily switch between civ and whatever- making those late game turns less of a bore. i really enjoy civ, its a lovely game for playing with friends and passing time. its a staple in most peoples steam libaries and if its on sale you should definately pick up the complete edition.",115.7
"for those interested in history and strategy this is the the best turn based game on the market.",73.9
"holy  balls is that civilization v?! you bet your sweet non dairy  it is! this game is ing hardcore to the max. commit gennocide, brainwash another culture with your propaganda,  space with your giant science ! this game is so ing good you would suck a  to play it, then play it, then suck a  again to say thank you for the game.",42.1
"absolutely long lasting fun, definitely something to play for enjoyment by yourself or a friend. the best civ in the series so far.",98.4
"this is a great game if your looking for a game that is really laid back yet so addicting.this can be played for countless hours and youll be having so much fun leading your civilization you wont even realize it. definitley a must have!",28.5
"best game lots of fun lots of love to the creators keep doin what you do",4.7
"the best series of all time as always in good shape. its my favorite and the worst game ever... why ? because iv lost so much time playing this game ^_^",70.6
"its a fantastic game plain and simple. the expansions are brilliant and add exactly what the game needs, the ai arent the sharpest bunch but you still find that you get attached to them over the course of a civilisations history and are reluctant to destroy them. it holds alot of charm and has a high replay value. go and invest if you havnt already its worth the money.",166.6
"just 1 more turn never seems to be enough when playing any civ game, and this one is no exception. great gameplay, with new hex maps and different twists on ideas from the older civ games. cant go wrong with this one.",261.9
"absolutely amazing strongly recommend with all dlcs",25.3
"if you want a game to eat your afternoons away, this is the perfect game for you. no other game has made me play it for 6 hours straight and not checking the time until after im done.",39.1
"civ v is a must have for anyone who enjoys strategy games. its especially fun with others, whether its a friend, a big group of friends, or just random people. the dlcs are honestly worth the extra money.",234.7
"civ 5 is a really awesome game, amazing graphics and sound, and overall, im really enjoying the civ 5 experience. however, theres a bug that causes the game to freeze with the game screen distorted whenever the computer goes on standby mode and with me trying to reaccess the game afterwards. hopefully this problem could be fixed?",16.5
"ive been a fan of the series since civ iii. i highly recommend it for its depth and new game mechanics. while the ai can be wonky or completely insane at times, i still very much enjoy the game. the switch to the hexagon tiles instead of square makes the game feel more organic. roads twist and turn, the borders of your country have a logical creep rather than the fat cross ive grown accustomed too. if youre a fan of sid mieiers games, i am sure you will like this. the expansions add a whole new level of gameplay. especially the tourism and cultural portion from the brave new world dlc.",483.2
"civ is a really in depth awesome game that is so addictive that i can play it for hours and not realize it.",102.9
"can you build more ghandis before wonders makes it into space? probrably not. but atleast you can build more wonders before ghandi makes it into space.",157.8

"sickest game ever! such a step up from civ 4 and the dlc makes it so much better!",265.5
"any game where i can columbus columbuss house is a game for me. 10/10",58.6
"amazing turn base stratergy game, can get lost in it for hours",75.2
"this is not a game for everyone, its not fast paced at all and it can take some time to learn. but if you can enjoy a slow paced strategy game then this is the game for you, there is a lot too it and if you and a group of friends decide to sit down and play this for a day then you will probably have a pretty good time. id rate this a acquired taste out of 10, its not for everyone but if you can enjoy it then you will really enjoy it.",263.9
"i love this game. ive stayed up for countless hours just playing away trying to win. its easy to learn but hard to master especially if the game is not set in your favor. i would recomend this to good strategists and people who just like having fun with there own civilization games.",67.1
"i named a city a  and it grew from 7 to 8. best 3 seconds of my life ever.",217.3
"impose my will upon everyone and kill them if they disagree? im sold ! super addictive. only thing i dont like is that i cant stack units like previouse games or make platoons of same troops like in civ rev. but that is super easily overlooked since the game phenomenal. looking forward to the next civ game in oct.",68.7
"this game has endless hours of content. a single game can last for days. its almost imposible to run out of things to do. i highly reomend this game!",88.7
"feels like i used a time machine when i play.. that can only be good right ?",32.5
"sid meiers latest entry in the award winning civilization series is fantastic. it allows you to rule a country however you would like, be it peacefully allying yourself with others or steamrolling them with the feet of your armies. the two expansions, although steeply priced, is a must for the full experience and i reccomend the dlc strongly. if you love 4x games and have a lot of money in gifted steam cards, than i highly reccomend considering civilization v. however, if you couldnt put a lot of time into one saved game (a standard game could be awhile,) then you might want to look at less time intensive titles. 10/10",791.3
"civilization 5 is probably one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time, i really enjoy the series even civilization revolution for the xbox 360. but overall i recommend this game to all 10.5/10",36.9

"if you like empire building this is the game for you! i would say that if you want to play on any setting other than novice it is tough!",46.7
"9.2 / 10 sid meiers civilization v i truely love this game and really cant hate but +amazing strategy game +good combat and movement effects +nice look to it / nice graphics - the leaders never change ex: russian leader catherine in 20th century -the friendship between different civs feels more of a job ex: they always mooch of you and you cant ask a favor back and when you dont give them charity they denouce you",150.9
"just one more turn... completely losing track of time is a pretty strong indication of whether a game is good in my book, and civilization 5 may be the best by that metric. as a newbie to the civ series, managing a society through the ages had sounded a bit daunting, but thankfully the game is very intuitive for series beginners. the visuals, narration, and music are all pitch-perfect, evoking a grand ambience fit for a game about world conquest. individual games can take hours, but it never feels tedious or repetitive. computer opponents seem to have plenty of personality, and multiplayer with friends is a blast. i realize turn-based strategy games may not be for everyone, but it would be difficult for me to find someone i wouldnt recommend this game to.",63.8
"i love it! simple to learn, but replayable. i havent even gotten around to getting brave new world because i am still enjoying the reular version, even though it is highly rated. this is like risk meets some tycoon game meets, uhh ehh... something completely epic! i am not exagerating. the only problem is that bnw is so higly liked that it can be difficult on occasion to find a multiplayer game.",351.1

"recently, my computer had been having overheating problems, which kept me from playing games other than minecraft for more than a few minutes. this was the one i missed the most. civ v is easy to learn, but difficult to master. a good introduction to strategy games for someone as inexperienced as i was. despite my initial confusion and minor information overload, i found it rather simple to understand, and soon, i was playing it for fun against computers far more than with the friends that wanted to play with me in the first place. i played it so much that i got bored and played around with the things in the workshop. its really quite fun. in the end, it really is more fun with friends, so i would definitely recommend you learn from an experienced friend, if thats possible.",310.7

"i have spent the most hours on this game. a game that i  for. it is so lovely when you nuke the enemys capital, and when you go on super easy so you just dominate just for the hell of it. if you dont like this game, you havent played it or given it a real try.",517.2

"oh god, where does the time go? do i like this game? sure should i have ever bought this time machine in disquse of a game? no crap, i sat down for a few quick turns at 7pm and finaly looked up at 3am. oh boy, i have to be at work by 8am.. hmm, that might be enough time for a few more turns...",159.3
"1-unit per tile replaces tedious unit stacking with something similar to a tactics rpg. policies are an excellent new feature, adding more fuel to the 1-more-turn-fire. diplomacy still not believable, with ais to hard to please. ai is still not a human, not vrey bright tactically. beautiful. overall, still the best 4x strategy series, made better with steam and modder community merge.",55.3
"the true meaning of a stategy game with patience and high amount of planning and perception of enemy moves and plans. also every dlc offers an ever bigger satisfaction and length to the game without making it too tired or extremely complicated 9/10 because there is no thing called perfection",112.6

"this game is absolutely amazing. iv sunk hundreds of hours into this game. absolutely massive replay value. something new each time!",284.2
"fantastic game if you just want to chill out with friends but have an awesome time as well. not the most strategic strategy game out there (europa universalis 4 probably holds that title) but it along with its two major expansions creates a satisfying experience for anyone who expects a challenging game with hours upon hours or even days upon days of content to enjoy. also with the vast help section giving information on almost everything in the game, the polish shines through. it does have very minor issues though, such as a few typos as well as the games take a looooong time unless it is on quick. overall though its a must-have for any strategy fan out there, its easy to learn yet hard to master. definitely recommended. 9.5/10",190.5

"well worth the money, long gameplay and obviously great replayability",45.2
"this is a game for everyone. it is so very addicting in the combinations of playing with each character. additionally, changing the definitions of a cultural victory has increased the game length because there are no more quick and easy culture wins. the addition of trade routes make barbarians just that more annoying.",111.0
"i have played this way way way way way way way way too much. but i dont regret a minute of it.",82.0
"like turn-based strategy? like age of empires? then this game is for you! its a fun game, even though the ai is a bit off at times, but that wont interfere with the gameplay. with the challenges, there are many different ways you could play, and win. you may declare war on everyone and go for a domination victory, or you can gather enough science to build a spaceship and go for a science victory. its a fun game, and it gets an 8/10.",158.6

"one of the single best strategy game ever made, plain and simple.",132.8
"you start with little and keep playing one more turn to unlock that new tech that no other player has, or one more turn to strategize a a siege against the other civs. then you realize its been a hour. ok well just a little more. one hour turns to three then five. great game.",68.7
"civ v is one of those games that you cant really say no to. as a turn based strategy made by the famous sid meier, this game lives up to the name of civilization. although ive encountered a few, but rare bugs in the game (such as a ship magically jumping into a lake from the sea) this game is a game you cant put down, you spend hours on it because you want to see what happens in just one more turn, what you can accomplish. 5/5 id say for this game. i recommend it to anyone from every part of the gaming spectrum",30.3
"love this game!! however, using multiplayer with strangers is the worst as it is such a long game and it takes donkey years to get a full game going. i also found it was very buggy when playing on mulitplayer but everything else is wonderful",146.7

"epic good game, mp is kinda nightmare tho specially with random guys who keep quiting",560.4
"its like meth, but youll lose more friends by using this.",43.1
"civ v is a really fantastic game to play with your friends. the single player, though, is good at first to learn the ropes but you will become bored of it after the first few games. this is probably because the amount of fun you have with your friends in the game is in sharp contrast with the amount fun the single player is. if you have friends that have or want this game then get it. if not then i would recomend waiting for a discount or price drop.",118.9
"fantastic, watch the hours of your life wash away before your eyes as another classic civ sucks you in. even better with gods & kings.",289.7
"what does it say about a strategy game when im able to figure out a first-order optimal strategy in my first complete game against the ai? this is technically my first civilization game--i never played the other civ games as a kid because i always found them a bit impenetrable, but firaxis deserves credit for their attempts to streamline the experience for newcomers.",58.0
"i lost friends over this game 11/10 best $30 ive ever spent",295.7
"amazing graphics crushing titles like crisis 3? hell no. complicating, difficult gameplay? generally, also no. however, these things are to be expected in a game like civilization v. what the game doesnt lack is strategic difficulty, diverse scenarios, addicting gameplay, and an adaptable challenge for anyone playing it. an absolute must buy in the genre, due to the replayability, and genuinely enjoyable experience.",141.3
"a game that, in my opinion, could easily top some of the newer shooters. would reccomend to anyone who likes strategy games and has a sense of patience",78.0
"great game - more complex gameplay than previous versions and gorgeous graphics.",50.8
"sid meiers civilization v is a slightly complex turn based strategy game that can be enjoyed by all gamers. a fun and interactive map allows players to manipulate their surroundings in order to achieve their goal. teaming up with friends in order to dominate enemy civilizations is a remarkably enjoyable experience.",39.9
"this game good. good game is buy. people play good game. people happy. repeat with civ 6.",285.5
"very good game if you like strategy, you can have rounds that last a couple hours or can last weeks depending on your preference. lots of detail in the playing map and the gui is very easy to use. highly suggested if you like playing strategy games.",65.8

"love the graphics compared to civ iv! and as always, an awesome soundtrack xx",17.3
"good game if u like turn based rts games but get all the dlc as the original is balls",113.8
"not as good as civ iv. but civ iv is one of the worlds best tactic games and not many games are better than it. civilization v is something new and special. there are new buildings, soldiers and diplomatic possibilities. when youve played it for some hours you know how it works and you can use the many different tools to become the biggest civilization ever.",65.8
"amazing game with countless hours of replay value.... the worth of the game goes up the more friends tou have to play with :d",349.5
"i once touched the butt of a 36 year old woman on a metropolitan subway headed to work on a monday morning. it was dark, gloomy infact; reminesant of most fall days when the trees wither off and the once happy plants die to live another day. the sun was just peaking over the horizon of the city scape and i could see the last remainders of a nights rest going to waste as the work ethic would pick back up again right where it left off. she was good looking, didnt look a day past 24. nice glasses and a  that even your mom wouldnt mind talking about. this one, was the one. now of coarse i couldnt just get up and walts over there like a sailor on the sea deck preparing to finally come home. i had to find a way to blend it, and not raise any alarms of the fellow dweary eyes around me. finess my way to the perfect platter that was awaiting my hungry arrival.... blah blah buy this game im tired of writing.",36.9
"this game simply is the most addicting game i have ever owned. cant get enough!",15.5
"played as a native american civilization. met a bunch of european civilizations(france, portugal, spain). they all coveted my land and kept trying to make me trade several commodity resources for just one of theirs. felt like i was repeating world history for a while. 10/10",95.4
"god has given us the glory of bretrayal and nuclear war with gandhi, thus i give the title of funniest/ funnest game to civ 5, but realy its an amazing game and worth the money.",306.2

"this game will take all your free time away, and no matter how long you try and resist and walk away from you computer, you will always return.",94.4
"this game is a serious load of fun; however, a single match can take ages. in the words of a good friend of mine, it would probably take less time to build an actual civilization than to finish one game here.",29.9
"amazing game, extremely fun specially with friends. only glitch that bothers me is the multiplayer modify and accept without other person receiving counter-offer glitch. 9.9/10 because of said glitch.",421.8
"civilization v is a very wel l made experience that will literally provides days of gameplay! with your friends, or running solo, the stories you create with this game are very well worth it.",50.7
"cuckold simulator my civilization was being fu*ked hard, and all i could do was watch",245.6
"this game is gonna take up your time. it gets better the deeper you get. you find yourself thinking just one more turn. very addictive.",504.7
"fun but make sure you get at least the brave new world dlc or it wont be as fun. if you can, get the complete edition and dont be dumb like me. the total dlc seperate is over $100 but with the compelete edition its an awesome price of $49.99.",91.7

"okay so where do i start? first week 25 hours in ok. i have owned this for about 7 months and have aprox, 140 hours. interduced me to the 4x games. easy to get into. i recomend getting brave new world too for the religion. also ghandi for lol has more nuke tendacies then nepolean?",219.2
"highly addictive and would recommend to anyone who feels like they dont want to see the sun for a while. i have had many sleepless nights cursing the queen of england, or the emperor of rome.",93.7
"this is hands down the best turn-based strategy game i have ever played. as soon as i got into my first match, i knew this game was amazing. if you ever sit around and say if only i ruled the town/country/world things would be better! nows your chance to prove it by ruling your own town/country/world. will you be a ruthless tyrant, or a shrewd diplomat? will you destroy your neighbors, or peacefully coexist with them throughout the centuries? its your choice. thats what civ 5 is all about: you shaping your empire the way you want it.",149.3
"this game is addicting what else is there to say just one more move... fun to play with friends",139.5

"forgot to recommend this.. its the best game ever xd i got goty first and then i bought the gold upgrade for $5 which was worth it :d",44.9
"i have enjoyed playing civilization. if you get this game multiplayer is a lot better than singleplayer. it is a must get game",22.5

"the pringles of gaming... dont start playing if you have any plans for the next 10 hours!",293.8
"if you havent played a civ game or only played civilization revolution on the consoles, its pretty complicated but its super fun even when youre -30 gold per turn and everything is terrible. its very satisfying to wipe a whole civilization off the map as they try to negotiate peace when theyre down to their last city. its marvelous.",44.1
"this game will eat your time. if you like turn based games or want an amazing time killer, grab civ 5! it feels amazing to build up a nation of nothing and win in more than just the traditional military way. play this with a friend its even better! ill be on this one for a while.",51.8

"one of the best stragety games of all time a must have for steam users.",144.4
"kill this guy ok youre a warmonger pretty good",73.5
"i love the entire civilization franchise; civ 5 is no different. its an amazing ton of fun to build your own empire. with the expansion packs of gods and king and brave new world (in addition to the other civs), the game becomes full - i highly recommend them as well. new to the game are city-states and a one unit per tile rule. this adds a great amount of strategy when thinking how to manage your military or dealing with other civilizations.",869.4
"an incredible game, though i found civ 4 better, a quick comparison of the two would pretty much state that civ 4 has amazing micro-management while civ 5 has great combat and graphics going for it. buy both while youre at it! but make sure you have friends to play with, single-player can get boring very quickly.",11.2
"if your thinking about getting it, get it. i dont even like stratagey games and i love this...",62.0
"this is a good game if youve ever wondered what its like to be a president that really does not want to be the president.",63.3
"this game will suck your life away. right through your . like satans vacuum cleaner. 10/10 would buy again",92.8
"i played civ ii when i was a 13 years old child, and i still remember these long, sometimes even overnight sessions ;). i skipped civ iii and iv, as i was always feeling of it being the same than before, but then i found civ v on steam winter sale and bought it. and it still feels like in my memories. so one might say that there wasnt much innovation, but when civ wasnt played a long time ago or civ hasnt been played at all this feeling of growing a nation and becoming more and more powerful is still great. and still it produces the same one more round feeling as always before. personally i recommend civ v to everyone who hasnt played civ at all or where it has been a while. for the ones who played iii and iv i have the feeling that its still the same.",16.0
"buy this game. amazing, and very fun. but you should buy the gold edition upgrade later on after youve bought the game, unless you wanna pay $50 dollars getting it all together.",200.3
"my wife asked me what we should get my son for his 3rd birthday, i told her well talk about it after this next round. today he turns 6 years old....",194.2

"okay, first you need to know that ive played everyone of the pc-based civilization games since sid meiers civilization first appeared back in 1991. with that said, ive enjoyed each installment in this genre and each has had its pros and cons. civ v is probably one of the strongest entries by a long shot even while it has a number of players of the series critical of several major changes that were made both in game play and with the units and combat. personally, while i was initially critical, too, of some of these changes, with time i have come to enjoy the current version better than most of the previous versions. the dlc/add-ons as well as the thriving gamer modding community for civ v ensure that it will last a good long while on many players systems.",253.9
"fantastic game. love being able to dominate the world. :d",255.8
"cmon. its a civilization game. its a bit meh without any dlc, but wtih brave new world, the game is great.",429.2
"this might sound like apocrypha, but when combined with the expansions and dlc, civ v has become my favourite game in the series. the gameplay mechanics and additional civilizations added by the expansions and dlc make it a rich and rewarding experience. i have a particular soft spot for the aesthetic style of the game, which feels like a beautiful board game. ive spent many hours playing this installment and dont regret a second of it.",309.9
"this game has been hacked! it is been used by unkowns and saids i have been on when i have not.",553.3
"best. strategy. game. ever cant wait for beyond earth!perfect in depth strategy without boring you! 14/10",771.5
"no other turn based strategy can beat it. best one ive played.",282.0
"i started playing civ 3, i do enjoy this game much more with the personalities of other kings/queens of empires. the addition of religion gives it a fresh new twist, while the graphics are very good for its title. lots of customizable features to help you explore the game constantly anew.",27.7
"...wait what its tuesday ive been plaing for six days what the hell happend",194.7
"very good game: i play it all the time. its a great semi-strategy game that can be played completely through in 30minutes to an hour, or all day! very customizable.",88.2
"a great game. good ui. runs decently well. fantastic art style. 9/10",137.7
"this game is amazing. very addicting, and so much to do in it. the scenarios are just the icing on the cake! a full game on standard time can last hours so be prepared! i love how you can win through multiple means, wether you want to conquer through military might and war or be peaceful and conquer through technology or like four other ways, and its great because its multiplayer so i can play with my friends, and theres plenty of characters to choose from each with their own abilities.",19.1
"this game is equivalent to a time machine, sit down to play one round, and boom! twenty-seven and a half years have gone by! on the bright side, =10 gold per city next to a river!",23.5
"i must be from a different planet... how can i really despise such a game when, sooo many people like it? ../  /",0.6
"i like this game beasase it includs lot of stratagy. it feels like you are aculy runing a governmen in acent times. the trading in the game is epic you can creat friend ship with coumputer controlled peaple or with real peaple. for the cunclshonh you should buy this game.",43.0

"after playing this for just an hour i was instantly hooked on it. this game is amazing and i recommend it to all strategy fans. 10/10",91.6
"fantastic! a very in-depth game with a variety of ways to win. you will find yourself in many different situations that require decisions that are both difficult and unique.",85.5
"this is my favorite game in the world. it will consume your life and youll play it instead of living your life. which is fine because you dont have anything going on anyway.",355.1
"this game is addicting, for the reasons that it pleases many audiences of even the most die-hard fps fans.",312.2
"i found this game extermely fun and also time consuming. it is like most games of this nature but more about being the better culture and not just an all out war, even though it can be. its a really fun and enjoyable game and it never gets old because there is always something new in every game. only drawback for me is how slow the beginning of the game takes.",45.4
"do you have a free weekend or no job? do you enjoy sitting in a chair beind a screen for extended periods of time? maybe you are 14? possibly 25 and no job and your mom doesnt bother you much? well, civ 5 is the game for you! watching small groups of people inhabit a hexigon and watching other people invade other hexigons is a blast. youll need to beat your wife and kids so they know not to bother you. order pizza turn off your phone and let the magic happen. you cant stop this. this game will end relationships.",55.5
"great game, even as an fps/rpg fan, i still find this game extremely fun. well made, beautiful graphics, and plenty of play time.",90.5
"purchased this game but, unable to play it using steam",46.6
"there is a lot to this game and unless you care any bit for a strategy game i would not suggest this game to you. it can be fun, there are a lot of different modes and a ton of different choices in this game. it takes awhile to get to understand. there are tutorials to help you understand the game and get better at it but you can still play the game, not have any idea of what your doing, and still get somewhere in it. i would know ;o.",41.5
"cant... stop... playing... dont judge it by vanilla - the expansions make the game. go for gold, at least. civ v with g&k and bnw offers a million different strategies to try. okay, maybe thats an exaggeration but no two games will be the same, and pretty much all playstyles are valid and do-able. combined with the workshop, you really can play just about any way you like. note: using mods disables achievements. not a big deal for me, but worth noting. with all the dlc, there are now over 40 civs to play as or against. just watch out for gandhi. seriously.",199.8
"amazing game with tons and tons of fresh and entertaining content. though the game is heavly, heavly improved by dlc. if your low on many brave new world is the for your interest. with an active modding community and so much content for such a small price during steam sales, its a great experience! vanilla civ 5: 7 out of 10 civ 5 with dlc: 9.5 out of 10 :{a must have for stradegy game fans}:",222.5
"i really like it. my wife and i are waiting for it to go on sale again and we plan on buying it for her to play. also the dlc looks great too.",169.5
"the best strategy game ive ever played, multiple aspects that make this game fun and entertaing.",77.5
"while the game gets a little bit repetitive in its gameplay over time, every playthrough is different enough to keep players interested. the game is challenging, fun, and captivating. it is also highly, highly addictive. the dlcs really add to the gameplay, but the game is still fun without them. highly reccomended, 8.5/10.",41.2
"very fun game which will never get old with all community mods e.g world war ii",4.9
"this game takes up time, but so does any great strategy game. the only problem i can see with this is you really need either gods and kings or brave new world dlc to fully enjoy it. it may be me playing with it for so long, but whatever. it is really well constructed, gandhi still goes on nuke rampages. ai is pretty well written, graphics and animation are beautiful. it is really just one of the best strategy pc games out there. tenouttaten would recommend to anyone. another note: to fully enjoy graphics you should have a decent pc. that aside, anyone on any computer can enjoy this. enjoy folks!",265.4
"celebrating 20+ years of gandhi nuking you off the face of the ing earth",2.4

"you thought you were going to do something today? nope.",132.7
"a joy to play like previous civ incarnations, and kept fresh with new ideas and possible strategies with a change to the unit-stacking rules, this is recommended whether youve played previous civilizations or not. some teething trouble at first that was soon patched enough times, i didnt really get into this version until the patches had come out, but i have to say it was worth the outlay. highly recommended like the previous games of the series if you like turn-based strategy games with more victory conditions than just kill everyone else (although eradicating all other players in the game will win too)",1097.3
"spend about 4 hours taking over the world. 4 city state bros the entire game. china salty at my world domination achieved with no war. build the un. buy chinas last city for all my gold, why, because they make nice silk clothing. day before un vote, china uses new goldpile to ally with my 90 year old city state bros. i lost the un election. one last turn? yes. nuke everyone. live in solitude on my radioactive globe of decay. 10/10",95.0

"with all the expansions, gods & kings and brave new world, this is the best game of the franchise! 10/10",334.3
"i love this game, it can be really fun to play with friends when youre winning and fun when youre not :3. this game is really cool because you can do so much, and it is also a game that requires you to think, use skill and strategy rather than simply pointing and shooting, and it has so many details and interesting game mechanics while not being overly-complicated.",180.4
"the game is good with brave new world. complete edition is recommended.",333.0
"i really like the new civilization. some people were critical because they simplified parts of the game and didnt add anything revolutionary. i think they did a good job of streamlining it while keeping core gameplay elements the same.",104.4
"are you a major nerd for history? turn the tables and brew your own history. as japan, you can own london and berlin. as american, you can be communist. build maccu piccu next to tokyo and dominate with a giant space robot. space is the limit in this world, dive right in.",152.7

"freaking awesome!!! sid has done it again. he has a legacy me thinks.",4.1
"like turn-based strategy games but had enough of those old and  graphics? get civ v. plays as awesome as civ iii!",33.6
"awsome. i got this game for my laptop and its has never disapoited me. integrated mod tools give me the personal touch i love in a game and the dlc scinarios give me the epic flavor of an expertly developed game",95.8
"this is a great game. if you want to test your ability to strategize against a smart and aggressive a.i, this game is for you.",486.4
"finally a game that lets me mold ghandi into the masochistic warrior i always knew he wanted to be. 10/10",249.3
"greece put a city right next to mine so i nuked it then ghandi nuked me, causing a world wide nuclear war where nothing remained but yellow nuclear clouds. then i spent 5 hours scrubbing it with a broom. great simulation",235.6
"great game, but a bit pricy for the full pack. expecialy fun to play with friends as free for all style game, but good fun for solo evenings too.",237.8
"easily one of the best strategy games at the moment.",29.5
"the best civilization game yet! lots of annoying micro management removed to make the game much more simplistic (in a good way), countless improvements, plenty of dlc, built in mods database, lots of civilizations to play all with unique units. favourite civ game to date. :p",128.7
"civilised is hardly what this game is. when ghandi finds nuclear weapons he becomes more war-crazy than any enemy ever written in the metal gear universe!",7.0
"is there a better game out there than civ v? i guess only when civ vi is released. great game!",222.5
"gandhi threatend to nuke me if i didnt recommend this game",368.0
"long fun games. just make sure you get all the dlc. the game is pretty useless without all dlc.",219.8
"the game is difficult when you first start but after that you feel that you wouldnt want to change anything. graphics are very good and adds to the overall experience. i would highly recommend this game to anyone even if they arent fans of the turn based strategy genre. 10/10",137.2
"great game! it seems like it would be really boring at first, but i ended up playing this for 5 hours straight the night i bought it. as you play, you learn more about the inner mechanics of the game and you start molding your personal strategy for success.",190.9
"complex strategy play to keep things interesting with some new (to me) options to enhance gameplay like espionage. overall a great game, easy to get lost for hours at a time.",110.9
"the best waste of time ever devised 10/10. probably one of the few must have games on steam it runs on practicaly any machine and has some of the most addictive stratagy that never gets old. even if you are not usualy a stratagy fan this game is for everyone becuase of its simple nature and easy to get to grips with systems. this game is best enjoyed with a low paced netflix series for maximum enjoyment and time wasting.",411.3
"before this game i had never played any civilization game and i decided to try it as the gold edition was on a huge sale. im not disappointed the game is pretty fun, but if you dont have much time on your hands i dont recommend this game at all even a quick match can take several hours. there is no story mode the game only features online play with players with a choice of ai to fill empty slots and single player vs only ai. if you enjoy games like this i highly recommend this game.",115.3
"strongly recommend this game. youll waste lots of hours in it, whether youre the strategy type, or not. even if you play vanilla, theres still tons and tons of fun with it. plus that the workshop has so many mods for the game.",63.7
"one of the best and most accessible strategy games available. i do not recommend this game if you have anything important to do because a single game can be a 15 hour+ time dump.",102.6
"as usual, civilization is the flagship of 4x strategic games. not without its disadvantages and, imho, a bit too much simplified, but still - the flagship.",75.6
"just as addictive (or more so) as civ iii, the first game i ever spent entire weekends playing. i am a terribad civ player, yet get a lot of fun playing it, every time.",636.5
"great game would strongly recomend to anyone who enjoys strategy games. good game to play with friends.",284.0
"this game crashes constantly. i am a huge fan of sid meier and the civilization franchise but i cannot even finish a match because the game crashes halfway through",10.7
"the perfect balance between complicated and playable, the dlc is a must though.",203.0
"a truely amazing game. well thought out, and never tires to entertain.",298.2

"you will not regret buying this game. i highly suggest it. please buy.",69.5
"i have decided to write this review, because i myself wasnt sure about buying, but reading reviews changed my mind. all i have to say that i was doubtful at first, but you learn this game pretty fast, but you master it pretty slowly. just one more turn.... and it is 2 am and i have to get up at 7 am, god... i hate and love this game at the same time. 10/10 would not sleep again.",362.2
"do you like strategy? do you have free time with no end? do you like conquest, culture, religion, and/or science? you will love this game. cannot recommend enough.",402.3
"its like risk, but no one is liable to flip the table on you! the dlc is must have and the workshop community downloads are great for improving or mixing things up!",598.9
"more than 800 hours.....my life guys....no i have shared it with my family. but as someone who has above 800 hours of this game on there account trust me when i say best pc game of the year. simple. cant wait for more.",822.6
"10/10 this game is so cool. i would get it if it was on sale or not it is so good",28.6
"one of the best games of all time. with all the dlcs, the possibilities are near endless! 10/10 would get nuked by gahndi again.",162.4
"in my top 3 games, the best strategy game i have ever played and has an amazing singleplayer with tons of different leaders to play as, and then tons of different units to battle/generate food/generate income/generate research with. its a real pity that the multiplayer is somewhat buggy as playing with friends is a real joy. highly recommended, especially at such a low price.",52.6
"very good game very addictive... will finish the review after this turn",65.4
"civilization v is probably one of the best games out there, its fun and theres always something knew that you learn everytime you play. i had all civs before this one and i never get tired from playing. i recommend to buy it and try it out you will like it.",133.9
"this is a great game, but it takes a lot of time to complete a game. and playing with friends is sometimes a nightmare because you have to finish the game online or meet each other in real life to finish the game. would rate 8 out of 10.",231.0
"truly enjoyable. if i could ever meet sid meier, i would without doubt marry him. 10/10",56.8

"this game destroyed my womb within mere seconds of installing. never before have i experience such a shrek type experience in all my years of playing games. note: this game will require the nintendo 64 expansion pak to run despite it saying otherwise.",465.8
"i am by no means a great rts player, but i still love games like civ v and other 4x/strategy games. this game series, more than any other, has the ability to make me lose track of time. the one more turn mentiality is easy to fall into as the game looks and plays great.",235.9
"addictingly brilliant. ive lost entire days playing this, and i have no intentions of stopping anytime soon. each playthrough, leader, map, and (perhaps most wonderfully) mod, presents a new an unique experience.",195.5

"really solid game with the dlc. it may cost more but its worth it. pick it up during a steam sale to maximize value.",225.7
"i enjoy this game a great deal. a little tricky to start with but well worth it.",11.6
"the highly moddable nature of this game really adds considerably to the life of this game. tools are provided to allow users to do anything from adding new civiliations, to changing the ui, to changing game rules and ai behavior. definitely worth a look for anyone who is a fan of turn-based strategy.",504.7
"its civ. is there anything else i really need to say?",102.2
"very nice game, easy to understand. strategy is very important here, but theres a little of adventure too. with new dlcs it is much funnier to play! you can win the game in some different ways, personally i always won with science victory. with the workshop contents, it is more interesting, but most of the addons require dlcs. soometimes it can be buggy. 8,5/10",119.2
"great game , turn based so low stress, build an empire",743.8
"i reccomend this game. like, a lot. its a great improvment from the previous game, and i really enjoy playing it. its just an awesome game. if youve liked this series or any games in the genre, i would recommend getting it. theres so much to do to stand the test of time.",81.1

"this game is like having the most amazing  of your life and then the mailman comes right in the middle and you have to stop half-way through and rush hurriedly to the door. my point is, games take so god damn long that unless you have the next 6 hours spare, dont start a game.. because something will always come up, and online games cant be paused, mom! 3/5 overall though, i like the game, but finding the time to play it is a right ball-ache.",35.6

"this game is pretty much addiction defined. it is the single best example ive ever played of the just one more level... syndrome. a long running strategy title where you create an empire and attempt to take over the world via military, science, or the arts, it is simple to learn and takes ages to master completely. can be considered to be age of empires older, more refined cousin.",112.0
"great for people who play table-top strategy games like warhammer",46.3

"real classic: it would be shame to miss it if you are even slightly interested into strategy games.",179.4
"a brilliantly addictive strategy game and an excellent introduction to the civilization series! great fun over multiplayer (if you have the bandwidth)!",275.8
"if you like turn base strategy games, this is one of the best i ever played. i reccomend this to all steam players",605.1
"insanely addicting game.. and you can get it and the gods & kings xpac for cheaper via my gamefanshop than you can buy just civ 5 for on steam. the codes you get via my gamefanshop work on steam as well, here is the link:",57.7
"this game is a bad. its just another rip off of pulp fiction",156.2
"this game destroyed my friendships, ruined my social life, killed my dog,  my sister, burned down my house, tied me to a bed, and left me there for about a week. 12/10 would recommend.",42.8
"very fun game, but i feel that it is a lot better with some of the dlc",24.4
"want to start a game at 7am, look at your clock and think about maybe going to bed at 3am, realizing you just fastforwared through time? buy it. buy it for a friend. travel through time together.",32.9
"excellent game to waste time with. you could easily (accidentally) drop 8 hours into this game in one session.",117.7
"better than ing dark souls by a mile long . but really this game is really good if youre either a science or history buff or you just like conquering the world highly recommend it",123.5
"one of my favorite series. a great game for those looking for a good challenging and strategic game.",50.9
"as always, civilization is fantastic. i personally enjoy civ v over iv. the hex system and military unit changes were a fantastic edition. movement and combat requires a little more thought now than the blob of death from iv. the game is beautiful, runs well, has wonderful music, and with the workshop, adding mods is even easier now.",121.0
"after many hours of playing this game is excellent when you just want to sit back and enjoy a even paced game. it can be a bit slow playing against other people, but then again i dont have the skillz to hold up against most people who play this online.",272.2
"ive only played civilization iii before playing civilization v. to be honest, i was just expecting better graphics and thats it, but i was completely wrong. this game improves almost everything in civilization iii. new rules, and new dimensions make the game refreshing, while keeping it still familiar. it still feels like civilization iii underneath, but with a more realistic gameplay. games take longer to win than what ive used to. ive spent the first 3 hours of the game only knowing of 1/3 of the map. ive skipped civilization iv, but i dont think i missed anything. civilization v is a winner. also, the linux version works better than i expected.",34.1
"a short review isnt going to cover the complexity and richness of this game, but then again: if you are attracted to those aspects in a game you would have tried this strategy game icon by now. a short review: if you like shooting, racing and football much more than strategy you probably will find this game too much. if you like to go in depth in each and every game you play you will love this like i do.",477.6
"brilliant game. civ 5 has a very good single player experience, although is amazing with friends in multiplayer. the only negative i have for this game is that as of yet, there seems to be no way to make the multiplayer ai any more or less difficult. the only way to change the pace would be to put a handicap on yourself. to get the full experience of the game, i suggest getting both of the expansion packs also, as this doubles the games content and replay ability. i highly recommend this game to anyone.",311.1

"our words are backed with nuclear weapons! -gandhi",70.3
"ill keep this short and sweet. i never played civ games for more than a few tries here and there over the years. i never played the original one mind you, but i played 2-4. i appreciate the genre, i grew up on board games like risk so this is nothing new to me. all that being said, i now love civ. it may have taken 5 games to get there, but i am hooked. i have spent many hours dominating the world, i will spend many more again. buy this, you wont regret it.",759.4
"never start this game if you have somewhere to be in the next 12 hours :)",347.0
"incredibly fun game. much like the civ 4 although far prettier and now with a redesigned combat system which i find very enthralling. terribly addicting and incredibly well designed. a must buy for a fan of the series.",75.2
"this game stole what little i had left of my social life... you should play it...",180.1
"great game, a just one more turn feel to it. i have been playing it since the first version and i still completely love it. i have been recommending it to the people i work with.",70.1
"this was the first civilization game i ever played, also one of my first pc games as well. being a first timer to the game, and the 4x genre itself, i was pleasantly surprised by the expansive tutorial and how easy the game is to get into. easy to learn, difficult to master, as they say. the base game is quite good, but i would really recommend the complete edition, brave new world being my favorite of the dlcs, refining the cultural victory type into an addictive way to dominate your enemies, not to mention the new world congress where words and legislation are just as sharp and damning as swords and military might. this was my first pc game to break 100 hours, shocking me at how soon and easily this feat was achieved. it is an endlessly playable game with layer upon layer of content. i heartily recommend this to anyone, even if new to the genre.",158.0
"very fun if you enjoy 4x games. personally, i think its very fun.",26.7
"this is a great turn-based strategy game that i would highly recommend.",128.9
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",14.1

"epic. i love how this game really makes you think. great game to play while tripping.",178.8
"as a long time strategy game fan, i can happily say this is my game of choice in this generations games. this is the game that sucks up most of my play time, right after kerbal space program, and i can easily reccommend it to anyone trying to decide to buy it. especially right now while its on sale. 10/10 easy.",343.4

"this is a great game, it has loads of replay-ability. the game never gets old, except for gandhi. gandhi is the worst.",17.3
"this game is like heroin, you just cant stop playing it. youll tell yourself just one more turn and then ill quit but later realize that youve sunken six more hours into the game. youll alienate your friends & family just so you can teach those dirty huns not to  with your cities while gandhi nukes your  of the planet. so yeah, get this game if you like doing hard drugs.",73.9
"civilization v is a wonderful game. it has many improvements over civ iv and was hard to get used to after just playing the later version but once i did the improvements were obvious. i like the additions of the city states and the tutorial is very helpful. i highly recommend this game.",38.4
"a frustrating game entirely. i am first expected to choose a leader of a civilization where i dont get to really choose my ruler, i dont get to choose my colors, i dont get to choose my abilities or traits. then im thrown into a world where my diplomatic choices are almost non-existent, im forced to rush to special units which may be completely pointless in about 30 turns when suddenly we are in an entirely different age. i had hoped that alliances, trade, and the foundations for any real civilization would be present in the fifth version of this series, but no... you are expected just to spit out as many units as possible and vie for military domination-- which most other 4x games do much better. 4/10",20.0

"this is the perfect strategy game ever created...yet. civ v can be incredibly relaxing as you take a huge  time planning and thinking about each turn. or it can be as mindblowingly intense as you watch your own hand crafted civilization fall to the hands of your long time friends (both ai or irl).",126.5
"this game is extremely fun and easy to get into. from bows and arrows to nuclear war, dirt roads to railroads and catapults to tanks, its fun to watch your civilzation progress. you almost feel a sense of pride watching your glorious empire rise and your enemies fall before you. you feel defeated and terrible if your grand civilaztion crumbles. this is just a great game to make your own story and alternate history. i reccomend this to everyone who likes creating your own story. 5 stars.",512.0
"this is a game that is easy to come back to on those quiet nights. every play through is different because of all the combinations of ways to win. this is especially fun in multiplayer but turns can start to take a really long time as the game progresses.",143.7

"where should i start? this game is absolutely amazing! it has so many things you can do. such as re-enact historical events, see what it would be like if different civilizations began in a different part of the world, or play against your friends in an intense race to see how can dominate the world. not only can you achieve domination victories, but your nation can also excel and thrive with science, cultural, and faith victories. no matter what civilization you are, you can build any world wonder you desire! as long as youre in the correct time period and meet the requirements of course. all in all this game is great fun, providing hours and hours of fun (and that will only be one game). tl:dr you can build giant death robots towards the end. 10/10.",141.0

"this game is amazing! it is for sure my favorite strategy game of all time! the options of what you want to do with your empire is unlimited, you can conquer the world with an iron fist or let the arts flourish among your people. some things i would want to change but nothing you cant fix with a mod or two. i would definitely recommend this game.",121.3

"this is a great game. whether youre looking for a intense challenge, or just to unwind after work or school, this game will provide the experience you are looking for. i am not very good at strategy games, yet i have spent many hours enjoying the nuances of this game. the expansions add depth to the experience and there are many mods (my favorite being the song of ice and fire mod) which further add to the game. i would recommend this game to just about anyone.",390.9

"an astounding game all by itself and with steam workshop support, possible playtime is basically infinite. buy this game.",271.6
"this game (as you can probably tell by how much ive played it) is quite addicting. its beginner friendly but still has advanced aspects for more experienced players. the major downside is that if you only buy the base game, its quite repetitive; i recommend to purchase the complete edition. the game also has a workshop, which adds more variety to the game. i once used a mod which spawned all the civilizations in true geographical areas which actually taught me some true locations of countries which i didnt previously know. overall, good game, 10/10, could ruin your life :)",347.1

"the best time suck you can buy. many hours have vanished while playing this game.",314.6
"i was a civ virgin going into v and have to say it didnt matter one bit - the design of this game makes it a pleasure to play for hours and hours and hours on end. but it has got some dodgy ai especially if you choose to be more aggressive in your world building with enemies seemingly appearing from nowhere or having an unfair advantage. if youre interested in strategy and want an engaging and fun experience then try this!",46.7

"ive always been a big civ fan since civ ii and over 400+ in im still playing. the hexagonal tiles plus the combat system change plus the changes to great people (g&k) are some really great changes over civ iv that honestly almost make it impossible to ever go back. its biggest problem is the same that its always been - its pretty slow paced. this is a game that can take a month to play through an entire game.",482.9

"like strategy? like challenge? then you will like civ v. in short it is an improved version of the previous games but with some added content which is also a blast. although i have been playing with gods and kings dlc added on so it may be slightly different with the standard version. also having online is a lot of fun especially with friends as you can have a lot of people playing at one time. its also nice to backstab a friend once or twice for not giving you that bit of oil...but thats just my story. also with a large and active workshop community new mods are fun to use as it only expands more on what civ v offers. although if you are not interested in long game times then you might want to avoid this one for now or get it in a steam sale as games can take hours and even days. although there is saving so you can take a rest but dont think you can rush victory in twenty minutes.",154.2

"if you havent played civilization before, you might as well just buy it. its an essential part of the history of computer games, and you should play at least one version of it. if you have played civ before, civ v is more of the same. its got more nations, more modes of victory, and more pixels. its good. the biggest change is that in civ v, you cant stack more than one military unit on a square. (actually, a hex. thats also a change.) this, i think, is sort of a downer. it definitely changes how combat feels, but it can be more annoying than it should be, especially because it doesnt work well with path-finding. on the other hand, cities can attack enemies a few hexes away, which is a big deal. it was worth the $15 i paid for civ v plus its two big dlcs, and i enjoyed the 40 hours i sank into it. im not sure it wouldve been worth the upgrade from civ iii or civ iv. its pretty, though!",35.3

"great game, still playing for hours per week. still miss some of the features of civ4, like slave states, etc. could really use some additional diplomatic options (like demanding surrender, slave states). and what i havent encountered yet in this version, in older versions if a huge empire lost its capital, it split up in two adding a new nation to the game. would be nice if that feature was also introduced again, or in case of unhappiness for a long time, certain cities rebel and form their own nation (which is actually how many nations were formed).",312.4
"i never played civ 4, but civ 3 was grueling and slow, killing your desire to leave the house. civ 5 is the same, but man, it moves more smoothly. im sure you could play a game in half the time, and have a better time. turns are streamlined, multiplayer is reasonably fast and stable, and there is a great deal of depth to the game, particularly with the expansions. fighting can drag multiplayer game speed down and science seems to be far and away the best strategy, but this game has lasting top 10 steam power because of the depth and the awesome multiplayer.",209.0

"to be honest i dont think ive ever been more absorbed by a game in my entire life. dont think that you need to be amazing at strat games to enjoy this one, this is my first civ game and the games tutorial system is extremely helpful without being annoying. it does a wonderful job of bringing you along in a way that just keeps you coming back for more. i advise setting some kind of alarm when you play this one though, this game is the closest the human race has come to building a time machine. buy this game, stop reading reviews and buy it.",127.6
"civilization v is the latest iteration of uncle sids brainchild, and to say the least the direction in which the developers took with this one has me torn. the new combat system (switching from squares to hexes, no unit stacks) is addictive, but reduces the scope and scale of the game by such a margin that your mighty empires dont appear to be as grandiouse as they were in the previous installments. however, the visuals are top notch, the new social policy system is incredible, and its first expansion gods & kings brings back what everyone missed from civ iv (religions and espionage.) all in all, it isnt my favorite civilization game, but civ v is most definately worth purchasing and putting ungodly amount of hours into.",493.6
"what an awesome game! a great game even for those new to civilazation with a great tutorial and helpful hints that you can set to walk you through the game in the beginning or that you can completely silence once you become a world ruler! the gods and kings expansion is well worth buying! it adds so much to the game, new civs, buildings, and ways to play the game. i dont see myself getting tired of this game anytime soon with so many options, new civilizations to play as, many difficulties to master and so much world domination to be had! if you dont like this game... well you must be crazy!",40.6
"civilization is fun even for someone that might not want to dive into the numerous strategic approaches and play an easier more relaxed game. but after a while once youve gotten the hang of the game all you want to to is play for hours on end. its addicting, unique, and has lead the way for many other games (but none surpass civilizations epic game experience). i would recommend this game to everybody no matter what age or interest.",78.1
"the depth and replayability are unsurpassed. it took a couple of expansions to catch up to the enjoyment i felt playing its predecessors, but now with all of the new systems in place it has become one of my favorite iterations in the series. thank you sid meiers, brian reynolds, jeff briggs, microprose, hasbro, infogrames, atari interactive, take-two, 2k games, firaxis and any others i am forgetting for providing me with years of such boundless entertainment. i can only imagine what the future holds for such an amazing and storied franchise.",700.3

"do you believe that your fit to rule the world. well you have to start from the bottom to get to the top! throughout the game i focused on more then world domination, theres an economy you must mantain, people you must feed and armies you must manage. its not as easy as you may come to believe. but when you crush egypt, or ghandi, or whomever else it may be, you walk away satisfied.",307.2
"great social strategy game. the engine creates a pretty easy-going sort of playstyle. artwork is decent, and so is variety. the diplomacy in the game does not have much depth to it, and creating a lasting alliance with another faction is a rarity. there is also the problem with turn processing, at later turns (150+), you may aswell tab out of the game, as you might be waiting over 5 minutes for the game to end the turn and start a new one. still very enjoyable, 8/10.",123.2

"one of the best games iv ever had the pleasure of playing i have logged around 112 hours and bought both dlcs.",243.5
"honestly one of the best games i have ever played. the replayability is unreal. i own the complete version and the dlc just adds so much depth to the game. the only problem i have is how hard mods are to install. pros gameplay ui replayability depth graphics mods (though limited they are there) cons sometimes wish there were more diplomacy options wish i had more control over my citizens sometimes",44.7
"i can spend years playing this game! fun solo player, and fun with friends :d a great way to destroy your friends egos!!!!!",118.5
"do not play this game! this game will create a dangerous local temporal anomaly if played for more than three turns. this game will make you loose hundreds of hours of your life that you will not even notice. for you it would be mere hours, and you will wonder if aliens had abducted you and erased your memory, cause that will be the only explanations for all those passing days you cant remember. but its not the aliens, its this game. so, do not play it! you have been warned. now, excuse while i make just one more turn. i swear it will be just one more turn.",5.7

"cant start it up most of the time one of the glitchiest games for me and i no longer own it and must re-purchase it because it hates me.",0.4
"good game, very fun to play with friends and others. but keep in mind the solo game isnt as fun as brave new world. so if your gonna get this game better get brave new world as well.",243.5
"do you want to go around killing and being killed by barbarians, and then immediately afterward fighting india because you have a resource they want? do you want to be immersed for hours moving around pieces on a virtual game of risk on stereroids? then this game is for you! do you want constant action packed chaos, making you not want to leave for only a second? get out of here and go get counter-strike, ya nub.",46.6
"just add this game to your cart. then during checkout, choose a friend to receive your gift.... and they will both love you and hate you for the rest of their computer-chair bound life.",285.8
"my friends think im the biggest warmongering son of a gun out there. some people call me a terrorist. i like to think of myself as a techer. they cower behind their embaroing and diplomacy i prefer the title as an opportunnist. 10/10",371.8
"buggy game at the start but after patches and 2 expansions it is fun to play",171.6
"for a buggy mess of a game, it is one hell of a fun ride",161.2
"i give this game a 9/10 i spent countless hours playing this time sucking game, and i loved every bit of it. there were a few bugs here and there but nontheless, great game!",231.4
"great game few things can be fixed like the trading ai with other civs.",284.1
"one of the great strategy classics, prepare to lose days of your life playing this game.",120.9
"an addicting, turn-based game that will make the time fly as you build you empire from the ancient age to post-information age! nearly infinite replayability as mods, random continents, and nearly 50 different nations ensure a different game every time its played will you build a space ship? or coquer the world? trade and commerce? or found a utopia!",217.1
"really fun, and really addicting once you really get into it.",109.0
"another civilization game and another stroke of genius. this game allowed for a personal approach to civilization development based on my own preference rather than providing a single formula for success. this is a great turn-based game and i strongly reccoment it.",53.2
"a great game - expecially with brave new world. just watch out for gandhi - dont let the sandals fool ya!",51.6
"great! i dont think ill ever know everything there is to know about this game! i highly recommed it!",55.3
"reminds me of the total war series. but better. without the rts aspect.",253.1
"love this game to bits, but.... alexander: you are settling near us, stop it! 2 turns later alexander of greece has founded corinth! *looks for corinth* corinth is right below kyoto",211.3
"outstanding game, i recommend it to everyone who is looking for a fun turn-based strategy game.",95.9
"i played this game so much that it melted my video graphics card...it is that good.",101.0
"this is a great game, and a great addition to the civilization saga. i have spent many days playing solo and with my friends, and will spend many more in the future. if you are a fan of stratagy games/ rule the world games then civilization v is for you. with many different ways that you can win this game has something for everyone. you can win a scientific/space race victory, a diplomatic victory through votes in the un, cultural victories, and of course you can just pound your enemies into the ground under the boots of your soldiers. the unique units/buildings as well as the special perks that each nation recieves makes this game interesting no matter who you play as. all in all i would give this a two thumbs up rating and now i think i might start playing myself.",391.9
"great game, best civ yet. but still not as good as alpha centauri",160.1
"super in depth strategy game. take over the world. why not?",30.2
"love this game! you will need both expansions to truly appreciate it. the gods and kings expansion added quite a bit to game play but with the latest expansion brave new world, more elements have been included such as trade routes, tourism, etc. that enhance the game even more. all that being said, diplomacy is still poorly executed in the game so beware of this negative aspect and enjoy what is a very good, if not excellent (4x) tbs game.",982.7
"there are mods to be the lord of the rings guys and the code geass characters. btw..... code geass won 10/10 would mind control again",28.4
"civilization v is a very complex but easy to follow game with many different ways to play it you can invite some friends or people you dont know to have a massive battle for victory with the unique methods of winning: culture, domination, time and science. you can load up some scenarios to play without having to start from scratch. or maybe the single player mode catches your eye by setting up your game just how you like it. never have i seen a game so fun and player friendly in a very long time. once you start playing, you cannot stop! if you enjoy a fantastic balance between strategy and action buy this game right now. id give it a 9.5/10",119.1
"good game, hella moddable, and well fun with friends not much to say about it more than that.",23.1
"easily my favorite strategy game and one of my top games overall. it requires smarts, cunning diplomicy skills, and lots of multitasking. with the complete edition now out, you can buy the game and all the dlc (which makes the game even better) for a very fair price. i can only say good things about this game except for one thing: the combat is fairly lacking. they had a good idea with all of the terrain bonuses and debuffs, but when it comes to pvp, its just hard to be able to attack and move your troops around, because a lot of the time, its whoever clicks first wins. obviously thats not the case all the time and the combat is still pretty ok, but if i had to make any complaint, it would be that. however, all around, this is a fastastic game and easily worth buying the complete edition.",170.4
"a masterpiece of a strategy game. i mean, this is like the standard by which strategy games are measured by. strategy is not my favorite genre, but as far as strategy games go, this is a excellent game.",262.5
"if you want something to do with friends this is the game for you",377.4
"by far, my most played game on steam. i have ruled the world many a time and i shall again many more times thanks to this amazing game.",352.4
"the original civ v is alright, but it is a brilliant game with bnw expansion. the depth is extremely large. the only lacking part is the ai choices seem to be less smart and i dont like the difficulty penalties.",306.4
"just one more turn... and suddenly its 2am and youre fighting on three fronts just because lincoln build the tower of pisa before you, so you attacked and all the city states have turned on you because really early in the game you wiped out melbourne because it was on the coast and you needed a coastal city. the mongols have denounced you, the aztecs killed your spy, your people are unhappy because you cant get a trade deal for sugar... and your last save was back in 1650; its now 1839. this is civilization. the game which can coast along nicely for hours, and then get intense in a heartbeat. the game which you might set out trying for a technological win, but end up winning by wiping out all others. the game which even multiplayer over email is still ridiculously fun. just one more turn...",217.7
"biggest time sink ever. 10/10 would waste time again",26.4
"i love this game. its a game of stadigy where you have to control a city and make it the best you can and beat all the other players on the map before they come for you. allthough the orignal map is quite small, you can just turn the settings to a bigger map! i rate this game a 5/5 allthough it was missing some really good fitures out of civ 4, they made up for it by making it in the dlc. + the dlc is so worth it.",10.8
"i thought i would play for an hour, then got off 2 days later...worth it",89.0
"fun with friends and takes strategy to a new level, buy brave new world with it, and you will be satisfied.",92.4
"this game is awesome. so many countless nights spent playing.",141.3
"i thoroughly recommend sid meiers civilization v, as it provides literally hundreds of hours of captivating entertainment at the expense of a mere 40 earth dollars. you can have endless fun attacking your (not really) best friends with nuclear weapons of mass destruction, destroying all of their tiresome efforts in one fell swoop. i dont recommend doing that last part too much, as, judging from personal experience, it can tend to provoke suicidal thoughts in the victims mind. other than that, its pretty  and overpriced.",213.2
"great strategy game, looking forward to the next one in the series.",574.1
"when played with all the expansions and dlcs, quite simply the best pc game ever (at least in my opinion!)",199.1
"awesome game. hours of fun with tons of replayability.",72.7
"i love strategy games. civilization is the leader of the pack when it comes to turn based strategy games and civ v is a worthy successor to the series. the brave new world dlc is a must-have expansion - it feels like a new game, not just an expansion pack. enjoying the broad options with civilizations and their unique abilities allows for much replay. overall - the best turn based strategy game available.",145.2
"brilliant game, best strategy game i have ever played",32.6
"this is the best game on earth! i completly recommened it to any person who reads this. dont bother reading the description of the game or looking at photos of the game or even watch a video. just click add to cart and then click purchase. i highly recommened this game to every person on this planet and even and aliens who have a steam account and would like to play a steam game. it is worth ever cent.",728.7

"no words one of the best strategy game of all time",332.4
"this game is a next-level strategy game. civ v is a masterpiece and now the standard for all strategy 4 ex games, and dont be suprised if you see more hex based games popping up. civ v isnt the great game it is without the expantions, unfortuantely, and you might think it wanting for more civs unless you get the expansions, which are huge by the way. civ v is another classic in the series, and it is an experience that you should want to be apart of unless you hate strategy games in general. this is one of the priemer games on pc, and is definately a must buy for any hard core gamer.",386.0
"this is a game that just keeps on giving. hundreds of hours into it and still enjoying every match. dont buy it for the multiplayer tho, while it is really fun to play with friends its sadly very broken and has heavy lag that really gets annoying later in the game.",288.4
"this game is fun but not as fun as vanilla civ 3 and civ 4 since it feels like a lot of content has been stripped away, only to be added again in dlcs but i still enjoy this.",100.0

"an awesome game. i dont recommend to the restless.",638.1
"sid meier is truly the king of strategy games. if you want a game where every move you make count, civ v is the game for you. to be honest its a bit tricky at first but you get hang of it after a bit.",209.4
"one of my favorite games of all time. you can literally spend 6 hours straight playing this game. one more turn is what the game is all about. the dlc also makes the game a lot more fun, and there are a lot of cool mods out there if you find the game becomes a bit bland over time.",218.0
"great depth of play. i still dont know what im doing.",140.7

"amazing game, would recommend to anyone wanting a fun single and multiplayer game. the skill level required is easily adjusted in the game menu, making this a game suitable for anybody and everybody. ;p",38.5
"where do i begin, civ v is the one of the best games i have ever played in my 9+ years of gaming. i love the strategy aspect and the fact that there are so many things you need to pay attention to in order to win the game other than other games being like ahhaha im just guna shoot and den i win haha. this game takes thought, intellect, and time. i highly recommend buying this game.",51.8
"this is one of the greatest games i have played in a few years. vanilla civ v is wonderful, and the dlc brings variety to the basic game, but steam workshop will allow you to play epic matchs without any risk of repeat fatigue. as of now, my play time is over 200 hours; you dont spend over a week on a bad game.",206.7

"you like good turn-based games? you prefer staying at the computer all day? well, civilization v is your choise now +good gameplay +pretty cheap now +add-ons are really cool! new civilizations and game mods are included. expansion packs offer a variety of new features +multiplayer (players vs players or players vs bots etc.) -expansion packs are much more expensive than the game -civilization v without add-ons becomes boring very quickly so if you have some spare time and 2-3 friends playing this game -buy it!",110.0
"after playing every civ game growing up, i feel that civ v while a bit different, was very enjoyable.",88.4
"doing this for badge progress but civ is amazing regardless",35.5
"love this game! not really used to playing these types of games. however im really into this! the best thing about it is the amount of people you get in a game (wheher its ai or online players). its just means there is always something to do, be aware of and work towards. some games, you have to wait a many turns to accomplish something. in civ 5 it seems like you are constantly working towards a goal.",9.8
"just got into the civ series with this game. as a new civ player, the single player content alone was worth buying the game. civ veterans seem to disagree on this based on other reviews i read. i let my brother try it and he got hooked. i woke up to him still playing the next morning, so i got it for him for and unlike others, we havent seen any multiplayer issues, yet (hopefully this continues). i think its important to note that i found this game looking for a new rts and it is filling the role quite nicely even though it is turn based and not filled with the fast paced battles i am used to. if anything, the slower pace and individuality of each unit makes it more fun than your everyday rts.",261.4
