"russia beat america to space 20/10 would play again.",119.2
"this is a really good game for spending your time off... played hours and didnt even saw the time going on... approved!!!",76.2
"i have been playing this game since it was released, and i still love it. this game is a strategic wonderland. the graphics a great... but that isnt what makes this game great. this game is great becase of the great thought put into the game and its mechanics. its balanced well and has great diplomacy and war mechanics.",203.0
"what can i say about civilization v... i am not a big fan of the strategy genre, yet this game has that charm, which makes me play it, makes me interested on how my civilization will live on. the game is really slow-paced, yet the time really flies playing it. graphics are pretty good, considering its a strategy game. this game pretty much never gets repetitive, everytime you can start differently, and win differently. only thing i dislike- 1 leader for entire civilization in ages. it kinda doesnt make sense to me, because the same leader living thousands of years... its weird. because of that, id rate this game a solid 9.5/10, i highly suggest you buy it.",26.9
"civ 5 is like playing an epic game of chess, with more than 2 players, dozens more pieces and nukes. add a side of diplomacy and espionage, to top it off with some awesome strategy sauce.",94.8
"game is very fun, recemmended to play with friends. 8/10 alone, 9/10 with friends.",109.1
"dont play this late at night, or you will be up until 5 a.m. trust me.",48.1
"this game also doubles as a time machine 5 hours longer than you wanted to play in the future.",11.7
"do you have spare time? well, if you want to keep it that way, you should not buy this game. the turn based nature alone makes you play it for just a few turns and you will keep telling yourself that. before you know it you have been playing for a week straight and the putrid smell in your house turns out to be your dog that has died of starvation and your children have run to cps and you are getting arrested. thanks civ v! 10/10 must buy.",171.7
"i find this game to be extremely captivating. i cant seem to stop playing it in my free time. it can be as easy or as challenging as you would like it to be. wrap it up with the sdk tool, and you can create a scenario with nearly endless possibilities. its definitely worth the investment.",14.1
"5 of 5! 10 of 10! super interesting game! play and joy =)",66.8
"very good looking modern strategy game. although many would say that it had its work cut out for it following civ4, civ5 manages to still offer an amazing strategic experience.",60.8
"this game is fantastic! ive played civilization revolution on 360 and this is 10 times better than that! well worth the price!",62.2
"- declares war on alexander the great - takes a city - everyone declares war on you - go back to a save a while ago -8 / 3",121.9
"excellent turn based strategy game, cant recommend it enough.",680.9
"this is a very, very addicting game. if you plan on having a social life, do not get this. make sure you leave the dog several bags of food before you start, because you will forget everything once you start playing. also, get the expansion packs for the best experience, and try out the mods because they are easy to get. make sure you use the directx 10&11 version, not windows 8 touchscreen version, unless you are on a touchscreen device. you will spend hours on this game and it is very fun, i recommend this game highly.",132.6
"this game can make you forget that free time has other uses. it is an incredibly addictive strategy game that takes away large portions of your life. a single game can take over eight hours to finish (on the standard speed, it can be set to go faster or much slower), so this isnt a game for the impatient. since its turn-based you can also easily do other things while playing, making it good for multi-taskers, though playing so casually will extend the already lengthy game times. i highly recommend both the gods & kings and brave new world expansions, as they both add a variety of new and interesting mechanics to keep each game unique. there are some issues, mostly with the multiplayer; mods are not supported in multiplayer - no matter how little they change the game - and the ai becomes much less interactive and therefore much more boring during multiplayer games.",210.2
"fun. time wasting fun. havent slept for days. gandhi is a mutherwarmonger. destroy him asap or face anger in the most horrific ways. highly recommend, but only when gandhi is defeated. 10/10, but only when gandhi is dead. fuc him and napoleon.",67.2
"this is a good strategy-turnbased game were you start as a great leader of a civilization. even though it is a very good game by it self i would recomend getting th expansion pack brave new world as it adds lots of new and interesting content",31.3
"just pure amazing soon a new game of civ called sid meiers civilization: beyond earth i am excited for that so fall of 2014. but the game its just magnificent. i reccomend it with a 10/10.",293.7
"this game is probably what made my life complete. creating a civilization, being the best civilization(or the worst), an endless amount of mods from the steam workshop. this game cant get any better 10/10",511.5
"buy now i mean it i have never had so much fun in a game i stayed up late just to play it worth the price but get it form amazon as it better.",235.3
"civilization v is a very complex but easy to follow game with many different ways to play it; you can invite some friends or people you dont know to have a massive battle for victory with the unique methods of winning: culture, domination, time and science. you can load up some scenarios to play without having to start from scratch. or maybe the single player mode catches your eye by setting up your game just how you like it. never have i seen a game so fun and player friendly in a very long time. once you start playing, you cannot stop! let alone the easy-to-install 2 dlc packs. for 20 each, so worth every penny. if you enjoy a fantastic balance between strategy and action, buy this game right now. thanks for reading.",195.2
"i played huns, and i reenacted the huns taking over rome against colton, where i force em to give me gold",44.0
"a very enjoyable game that requires strategy, depending on what difficulty you choose. its really fun because of the four ways one can win the game: domination, science, culture or diplomatic. in my opinion, the easiest victory to get is domination because the ai is aggresive but that shouldnt hinder getting achieving victory by other means.",161.8
"great turn-based game, spent way too kuch time playing this! good for quick games or long marathons! :d",48.5
"a turn based strategy game that needs a lot of time invested in it before you see just how much fun it can be to play. im not totally convinced its better than its previous versions or that the pacing is right. still the game has loads of mods available for it that can change the whole dynamic of the game so its potential for replayability is not in doubt. an absolute must have to any strategy addicts games library",258.3
"best one in series so far, even better then beyond earth. atleast more deep.",331.7
"i have spent far too much time playing this game to review it. i now much the time.... it is a very addicting game to those that want something slower paced.",733.5
"this game is freaking fantastic and i definitely recommend buying this game. this is the type of game you can spend hour upon hour playing with a freind or by yourself.",199.8
"have you ever had a game take over your life? well once you start playing civilization v, you start to notice that you started at 1:00 pm, and now its 3:00 am. i find it to be really fun and enjoyable. it is alot better if you have friends that arent slow that play the game!",313.0
"this is one of my favourite games it just does everything right in a strategy game",521.7
"definitely recommend this game, me and my friends love it!",103.1
"the history of the most fun simulation game series of new works. buy it!!",148.0
"an extremely good fifth version of this series. more leaders, more units and some fantastic scenarios.",283.6
"fun game, even better at 75% off, not worth the full price though, good as it is. but then again, no game is worth more than 10, if you pay more than that youre a mug, id say.",121.8
"great game. fun without dlc, and dlc make it feel like a whole new game, or a whole new world (<----pun).",319.5
"the ultimate strategy with a huge modding community in steam workshop, if thats your thing. although military victories are ht major type of its kind, the customisation of scenarios and world types are very impressive. leaders are also a great part of it, both historical and comical at the same time. one could describe it as a a chess game(due to hexagonal movements) with more then 2 players and 1000x the amount of complexity. yet the game is still extremely accessible and , well for me, easy to understand. despite this, i recommend to have some experience in strategy games, such as xcom or total war. but if not, there is no better time nor place to start then right here ,right now",123.6
"i have 77 hours played on this game and ive probably played no more than 10 games",80.9
"when you play civ 5 you forget there is a world outside of your bedroom 10/10 would forget again",69.3
"though i do recommend buying this game, that doesnt change the fact the firaxis is full of greedy jews (please pardon my bigotry). wanting $30 each for thier dlc. however, after ive typed this out, ill probably cave-in and buy g&k. but guess what? thats exactly what they (firaxis) knew would happen!",117.7
"gandhi nuked my capital city three times in a row he then started a major war with each other civilization and killed them all 10/10 would be killed by a pacifist again also make sure you play with brave new world and gods and kings or the game gets boring after some time still really good tho",9.4
"it is a great game to play with friends and family or even by yourself, enjoy!",97.1
"one of my new favorite games, and that is saying alot about strategy games for me as someone who fell in love with games like aoe 2 and 3 for the longest of time.... not at all the same type of game, much more fun. do you find it to get boring from time to time? buy one of the two great expansions for the game it really ads alot to the experience! -have fun-",26.6
"have been playing for years and have never got bored of it, it is a must buy!!",268.9
"great game would strongly recomend to anyone who enjoys strategy games. good game to play with friends.",284.0
"this game is just awesome, addicting and adorable to watch. civilization is a turn-based strategy game where you can play as a world leader of nation or an empire. this game has 2 expansion packs who are worth its money. the soundtrack is just plainly beautiful to hear and it will never be annoying after hours. the character models look great and sometimes also intimidating. i havent played multiplayer yet but the singleplayer is how it should be. civilization 5 belongs to one of the best strategy games of all time. singleplayer rating : 10/10",105.1
"vanilla is adequate. gods & kings is useless (included in bnw). brave new world is great. the mods, however, define the reason why i love this game. pro - purchase it and see how quickly 5:30pm turns into 4:45am. con - purchase it and see how quickly 5:30pm turns into 4:45am. con - mods disable achievements (understandable).",528.8
"this is an extremely fun game, however without the dlc and multiplayer it would be dreadedly boring!",107.5
"definitly a good game for those that want a long and fulfilling time.",80.0
"normally id start this review off by saying something like if youre into strategy games this is a must buy! but ironically i, myself, am not a big fan of strategy games, so i think it speaks volumes to the entertainment value of this game when i have logged over 600 hours into civ v yet dont identify myself as a lover of the turn based strategy genre. if you can grab this for a good price, its absolutely a must buy!",636.6
"just one more turn! no, you wont close your game after this turn, the turn after, and the turn after the turn! its just addicting that you wont even pay attention to how long you have spent in the last session.",248.8
"after all this time i still enjoy playing for hours civ5. the graphics, ai, and longevity of the game keep me entertained.",72.2
"civ is an amazing empire building game and very realistic i definetly recomend this game",36.8
"buy it once, play it for life. insanely deep strategies, hugely varied gameplay and ai that hates you all makes for an experience that will leave you begging to be able to click next turn just one more time. (also  alexander the great)",293.7
"an excellent game, im mainly doing this for the badge. this game has served up hundreds of hours of my time, and if you enjoy strategy and intelligent playstyle, this game is for you. although playable by the laidback consumer, the game truly shines when one is a hardcore strategist and can enjoy exploring the mechanics of the game.",557.5
"good game, but seems a little lacking in the replayability.",108.8
"an advanced strategy game, that defiently gets the catch of you. 10/10",22.4
"this game is good to play with friends and be horrible to them at the same time",83.4
"this game (as you can probably tell by how much ive played it) is quite addicting. its beginner friendly but still has advanced aspects for more experienced players. the major downside is that if you only buy the base game, its quite repetitive; i recommend to purchase the complete edition. the game also has a workshop, which adds more variety to the game. i once used a mod which spawned all the civilizations in true geographical areas which actually taught me some true locations of countries which i didnt previously know. overall, good game, 10/10, could ruin your life :)",347.1
"one of my favourite games, have not been able to part with it since i bought the game. a real challenge on harder difficulties, with smart, aggresive ais snapping at your heels. never the same scenario twice. would reccomend to all.",414.9
"outstanding woooo! after 2 years 2k games finally fixed the multiplayer! now you can play with more than 4 people! and it actually works once in awhile! amazzinngggg p.s. brave new world is great fun, but venice is overpowered and broken in multiplayer",724.4
"if your computer can play it, then why dont you own this?!?",217.9
"always invites you to play just one more turn.. and another..",75.3
"this is probably the best strategy game out there, at least that i know of. it is very fun, and you actually get to know something about history too. solid game",118.7
"great game, a little hard to get going but when you have friends to play it with it is definitely fun",94.7
"wishlist (3) cart (1) featured items games software demos recommended news linux all games > strategy games > sid meiers civilization v community hub sid meiers civilization v",79.5
"i just love this game <3 i played all civilization games and i love all of them 9.5/10 thanks sid for this awesome game",28.2
"ghandi is a piece of  lying trash watch your back, hes a scumbag. would not trust/10. you can actively be burning down the ais capital and theyll still demand you give them gems. fantastic.",99.9
"if you like strategy games like xcom. buy it. if you like pew pew games. buy it. if you dont have cash get a friend to gift it to you.",23.1
"meh, it lacks the depth i like but is fun for a sitting or two.",62.7
"one of he greatest games i have played. best simulation/ tbs game i have played",37.8
"if youre going to get it, make sure you pick up the major expansion packs as they add significant depth to the game that could otherwise be said to be a bit shallow.",241.5
"great game, addicting and fun. i fully recommend it",128.8
"well, what can i say about this game? hmm...i bought it, downloaded it, proceeded to play for 10 hours straight. uh-huh, yeah. this game...this game. i didnt think i would like it, but my all my friends bought it, so i decided to. i quickly got addicted. a big factor for that was all of the fps games i had been playing, so this was a nice change of pace. definitely a game that is worth your money (although i got the base game and all dlcs on sale for $17.00). so yeah, um, yeah.",347.3
"great game to just relax and unwind with. if you get bored, just add mods.",312.0
"buy. this. game. i love it, and have nearly 300 hours played. it is addicting, and you will lose track of time and possibly your loved ones. so many things to say about this game. its beautiful, diverse, detailed and fun! you can chose from many different civs and build and empire to conquer or negotiate your way to victory. many fun achievements and easter eggs, special units and ways to win. this is my favorite strategy game!",462.6
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",14.1
"this game is amazing. if you like those 3rd person world control games, like halo wars or command & conquer, this game is for you.",78.6
"21 hours in 4 days! i think im addicted. this game is incredible, a must play!",219.3
"i love this game and i can only recommend it to other people, its a great strategy game with mod support (turn based strategy), it has a few kinks (not really bugs), and it takes some time learning, but its worth it.",61.7
"fun addictive time sink. can lose hours without realising. the addition of the workshop really adds to the variety. up there with 2 & 4 as the best of the series.",210.4
"when will this go onto offer got so many friend wanting it but wont buy it until its gos on offer overall tho, bloody good game !",95.4
"what can you say that hasnt been said? im not funny enough for a one liner review...every iteration of civ is better. love the new non stackable units. much more strategic and puts emphasis on each individual unit. smooth graphics, fun mods, better luxury management. aaa title for a reason.",28.3
"-caution- this game can be really addictive!!! dont play if you have any of these condition: girlfriend, children, job, studies or any other reponsabilities. beware of the consequence...",454.8
"such an amazing game that i thought i wouldnt like before i played it",131.5
"the classic turn-based strategy game, but with hexagons!",344.1
"i would like this game. played hours to conquer civilizations and i think its fun.",133.0
"fun and involving game which you could lose several hours to easily if you dont keep attention on the clock.",281.8
"one of the most enjoyable pointless spergy things on the planet. i endorse and utterly dont endorse this.",161.6
"2015, multiplayer still crashes regularly. my friends and i paid money for this game and no matter what we try, we cant get through a full multiplayer game without it crashing and us losing turns. a quick google search will show were not alone.",31.8
"as a long time strategy game fan, i can happily say this is my game of choice in this generations games. this is the game that sucks up most of my play time, right after kerbal space program, and i can easily reccommend it to anyone trying to decide to buy it. especially right now while its on sale. 10/10 easy.",343.4
"excellent way to lose many hours of your precious life and not regret a moment!",116.1
"by far better then the last few. but i am a junky. so there you go.",84.4
"absouletly amazing game i couldnt stop playing once i got it i recommend getting the dlc aswell making the game even better!",490.4
"wish they had a better multiplayer portal like a chat lobby or something, but otherwise a great game that will entertain for hours , and i do mean hours!",328.1
"when you start playing this game time gets away from you way too fast! excellent game cant wait for civilization: beyond earth",72.1
"probably one of the best stradegy games ive ever played. i recommend this game, but i warn you its only half as good as it can be without the gods and kings expansion, and the brave new world expansion. so, if you plan to get a full experience from this game you should purchase the complete edition. being a tun based this is for people who like to plan out stradegies, and out wit your foes. i also find that many who just want to play a casual game will also like this stradegy game due to its turn based nature you can enjoy a relaxing game. it also offers a strong multiplayer with many customization options. i would recommaend this game to most gamers 9/10 would buy again ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- jollywatson",245.9
"- announced protection to city state, portugese fat lady declared war on them. raided her capital city, didnt get denounced by other leaders. - caught enemy spy in my capital, declared war. caught everybody elses spy during the war, destroyed the original perpetrator and everybody was ok with that. even after 10 hours in, still scratching the surface. 10/10",10.9
"best civilization game out yet, beyond earth is good but in this game you go throughout the years and your troops can change due to the era you are in such as industrial era and modern era. this is hands down the best clivilization game ive played. i highly recommend this game.",67.2
"i played a few hundred hours of civ 4 as my introduction to the series and while i remember liking it, it didnt hook me like civ 5 is doing. fantastic",183.0
"civilization v is a fun turn based stratergy game in which you aim to advance a small civilization into a large empire. well worth a play if you like games of this genre",5.6
"its mother flippin civilizationn v! whats not to love?",348.8
"you can choose to play one of many civilizations to play, each with its own unique unit and building, you can make your own maps with world builder, its simply awesome! gameplay is easy to figure out, lots of fun with managing production, income, trade, and your military. though there are some issues with multiplayer, like major lag and crashing and constant game sync screens... realy annoying.",151.2
"ive managed to play 254 hours of it and im still not bored.",292.9
"after 870 hours of gametime, im still playing it. excellent value.",967.1
"a little different to civ iv, but easy to get the hang of. all in all a thoroughly good game. it will nab your free time though, so make sure you keep an eye on your watch! if you enjoyed civ iv, you should enjoy this just as much.",372.4
"civ 5 speaks 4 languages: english, profanity, sarcasm, & real .",142.2
"one of the best strategy games released in last years.",36.1
"old, new doesnt matter, so many countries, more you understand this game more fun you will have",143.6
"if your a fan of strategy games give this game a spin. civ 5 offers a ton of fun content available to each player with multiple ways to pave the path to victory. the core game itself is a good game. add gods and kings or brave new world and your playtime basically doubles and triples. even with all my hours in civ i still dont tire of playing it. 9/10 would play again.",134.7
"a lot of fun to play. warning though time will fly while playing this game",28.3
"a fantastic time sink - with the bnw expansion i think it finally can be said that it eclipses iv as the premier in the series. while some may disagree due to the added depth from the earlier edition, i feel as though the much improved combat system pushes v to the top.",169.3
"if you buy a game purely from how much hours you get from it, this game should be worth 100+. its  how much time i spent the first week i got this game. i spent the whole first week playing this game. wake up, play, eat, sleep. wake up, play, eat, sleep. for a week. for one game of civ. just buy it if you want to lose the rest of your days. it is now belong to sid meier.",66.6
"well, let me just have a quick round... holy  why is it 4 a.m.",43.1
"its a great game to change history. wish rome was still around? play as augustus caesar and rule the world. wish carthage hadnt fallen to rome? re-fight the punic wars. just like nuking everyone into radioactive particles? go ahead, but dont expect to be popular...",498.6
"this is a very good game. too many one more turn, one more turn and save, save, save. yea, i know, i am a wimp. :(",67.6
"one of the best games ever! so simple yet so much fun. can easily loose a day or two and not realise when your ruining japan as napoleon",89.0
"make sure you have plenty of free time because this game just eats it up.",159.7
"so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",95.4
"with bnw, civ has recovered from its unengaging start and demonstrates the spirit of the franchise: just one more turn...",535.8
"if you are into strategy games than this game is for you. best 4x so far. most people are complaining about the absence of unit stacking. i think absence of unit stacking adds far more tactical depth into the game and multiplies the joy of victory.",177.1
"a wonderful game since the first release. civ 4 was great. civ 5 is great too but it comes with better graphic and the hex grid with a different combat system. i really enjoy this kind of game ... lets do another turn ... oh another turn ... wait one more turn. to me its a real keeper once started u cant stop lol. it offers so many depth in politics, economy, trading, research etc. which is welcome by old players but it might be hard for new comers.",152.0
"great game for turn based strategy (tbs) fans. some of the modifications made the game concepts change from previous version, but the changes were for the better.",706.6
"i played a few hundred hours of civ 4 as my introduction to the series and while i remember liking it, it didnt hook me like civ 5 is doing. fantastic",183.0
"the best entry in one of the greatest franchises of all time.",798.7
"got civilization v as a gift from a friend, took me awhile to install and test it out however since doing so i havent been able to stop playing. not a huge fan of turn based strategy games however civilization is slowly starting to become one of my favorite games. i know i am late to the party but i would recommend it to anyone who likes simulation or strategy based games.",33.5
"good strategy game, now that i know beyond earth is not worth buying at the current price, i look foward to purchasing brave new world, plus the other dlc when they go on sale, i was always hesitant to waste money on the dlc when the the great beyond earth was right around corner from release",246.9
"very addictive game! the (expensive) gods & kings dlc is a must buy though.",387.7
"good game but some major differences from the previous civ games. troop placement being one of them. has a few flaws in gameplay but overall worth the money if you like 4x games.",222.0
"need to pass a large amount of time as fast as possible while being mildly entertained? this is the game for that.",203.3
"tacking on the noobs part kind of nullifies the whole gg part",100.8
"its definately worth it, i love it. its for the type of people who love strategy and long-term games.",78.2
"best game ive ever played has hooked endless and replayable",61.5
"once you add on the gods & kinds and brave new world expansions, the game comes into its own as the definitive civilization. ive played hours and hours over the years since its been released, and the depth really comes out in the more difficult settings. by far the most-played game in my library, and unlikely be eclipsed by anything else in the foreseeable future.",316.8
"300+ hours played, nuff said. gold edition $20 at eb games yarse (:",623.6
"i think this game is a great stragity game and i love ot",116.4

"pretty fun. takes a while to play through 1 game fully.",62.9
"i cant do any work anymore because i end up playing this 10/10",478.0
"this is one of those games that you need time to play. i love the game dont get me wrong but, if you do not have alot of time on your hands, the quick games (unless in mp) are not as fun. so far i love the game and would give it a 9.5 out of 10",1018.9
"for strategy! this is a really plus game! form the league of superfriends with your favourite civilizations! declare war on poland! outpopulate india and china! form nato with russia! get backstabbed by france and greece! france:  y u haff to be mad, it only game . yeah france, well screw you. ( no seriously get this game its good )",572.6
"seemed boring at first, but then i actually started to play it it slowly became more intense as i built my first death robot, i was like wtf.11,,1. on a serious note really good game, recomend getting gold version, (i thought i bought it but apparently not)",67.4
"great strategy game for everyone. and by that i mean you can make it either super easy or super hard or a really quick match or a really crazy long match that could literally take days. whats not to love!? its also quite amazing to see your civilization go from hut dusters to mech riders.",28.7
"i dont know why this game is so popular. of course its always funny when you start playing at 20:00 and realise 6 hours lather that its now 2:00 in the morning, or when you declare war on ghandi. but the main problem of this games is the lack of elements of gameplay. its too easy to win battles, you just need to train more units than the ennemy. at some point its not even fun anymore. it might get very boring sometimes !",48.2
"civilization is the leader in turn based strategy games and civ 5 represents the series well, go play it right now.",109.3
"this map script uses various manipulations of perlin noise to create landforms, and generates climate based on a simplified model of geostrophic and monsoon wind patterns. rivers are generated along accurate drainage paths governed by the elevation map used to create the landforms.",364.0
"if you have a lot of free time its game for you :))",105.0
"i finished 3 games in 56 hours. 10/10 would invade again",73.9
"really awesome game reccomend it just could not stop playing it",7.1
"i used to love civ 5, especially after gods & kings and brave new world. however, now with games like age of wonders 3, and endless legend, i just dont find it fun any more. also, multiplayer is impossible with the overwhelming amount of desynchronization.",179.8
"great sandbox game, but most multiplayer servers are crappy because of the required addons.",69.9
"this game is the most fun management game ever. i dont think i could ever insult it 2143621341234123432/10",17.3
"if you wanna mass produce an army and be rolling in the cash, then play this game",69.0

"nothing beats being george washington in 1200 bc, allied with augustus ceasar, establishing washington in present day nigeria and philadelphia in present day sydney, not to mention the fact the hagia sofia is in new york. any rts or turn based players should pick this up.",441.3
"i love this game, one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",12.1
"the loss of culture flipping cities is unfortunate, and they simplified cultural victories into simply an offense and defense stat... but still a fine addition to the series.",98.3
"very addictive game which will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours! will also significantly improve your knowledge of history.",194.3
"really good game to play wih friends. really recommend it!",309.3

"great game!! play this game 24/7 and is the most fun ive had in a game, especially on multiplayer!",208.1
"really enjoyable but takes hours - days or longer to play would definitely recommend.",32.6
"ive really liked civ 5 a lot. ive been going around buying a lot of reasonably cheap games recently trying to find something i can really be dedicated to and civ 5 hit me on every intrest level. its a game of politics, economics, war, ideology, and trading. i love all of the historical leaders you can trade with, become allies with, go to war with, or be one of them. i played march of war which made me not a huge fan of turn based games. civ 5 completetly changed my mind bringing a whole new meaning to the term turn-based for me. the only thing i would really say was bad in this game is the multiplayer. i strongly advise you just make a game with freinds and organize it if you want to have a successful online game. if you want to just play with anyone you want then it will probably crash or people will quit. overall this game is a 9/10",210.1
"this game along with civ iv, has taken hudnreds of my gaming hours. if you like strategy games, and dont mind long games, try this game out. now be warned, if you plan on buying civ v, buy the two expansions! they add much needed mechanics that the devs forgot to put in civ v (unfortunately). but once you add the xpacks, this game will take many hours form you too! the game revolves around taking a control of a civilization (from nations like ashurbanipal of assyria all the way to napoleon of france) and, beginning at 4000 bc, you lead it all the way to the future age. you build, expand, and develop cities, and create alternate histories where the americans built the pyramids. i recommend this game to anyone willing to spend countless hours, but it is defiitely worth it!",355.6
"epic - if youre not that in to fps games and such and like a good thinker and strategy with a civilization thats constant developing their tech to kill an enemy or get loved by the ppl then i recommend that you buy this game now while its on sale on steam!!!",95.8
"i picked up civ v because i have played the previous versions of civ. i love the new graphics. i find the new elements being added with the expansion/dlc very interesting. i do wish that there was a way to turn them off if you want to go back to the base game.",337.6
"great game, way better than the first. but its very addicting",9.8
"the king of round-based strategy games suited for beginners and experts this game offers hundreds of hours of empire-building, diplomacy and war. brave new world is strongly recommended, as it adds a lot of fun features. civ5 also supports mods, but only in singleplayer. 9/10",252.3
"jesus, what a game. in single player its awesome, in multiplayer its a really great way to spend the day",72.9

"a game about growing cities and giant people and animals that protect them. gandhi nukes/10",185.5
"siv v.. a very good game indeed but needing some improvents including some new characters like stalin and hitler.. because when i get home after a hard day of work i like to recreate the genocides that happened in the 1930-40s.. it brings a tear to my heart of happiness when i see it being done. this game is great for almost everyone that likes to think (1% of the u.s population). 1 final problem with the game is that when you are allys with a city-state or ruler, not once can you ask friendly troops if they want to have sex with other troops, very prejudice against homosexuals i see. anyway, would recommend to most folks. 69/69",42.3
"once you learn how to ing play it correctly... holy ...",14.2
"what a great game so far... i havent really played it multi yet, but single, online or off, is fun! i recommend this game to all my friends!",41.8
"i loved this game and could not stop playing it for 5 hours then the next day 5 more hours and so on",185.3
"the later expacks have made the game somewhat intimidating for new players, but youll be playing this game over and over - every time is a different game.",949.4
"its really fun but recently it has been crashing so if a patch comes out i reccomend buying it",59.8
"this game is recomended it is very fun but if you have a bad computer steer clear of multiplayer and if really bad dont buy the game till you get a better computer (trust me ik) over all pretty fun gme i believe it is worth time into it",20.5

"i love this game. if you have a life, you might want to discard it now",151.4

"played tutorial for 2 hours then realized i couldnt save then started a normal match and played for 17 hours 10/10",39.6
"do not buy this game if you like having free time. its not a game one simply picks up for an hour or so. it is the video game equivalent of heroin: it will suck away hours of your life at a time, leaving you in a stupor afterwards, thinking only about when you can boot it up next and finally knock off that a-hole suleiman for good. its terrible but, its so, so good.",230.1
"addicting game, much fun. good if you like turn-based strategy. good time-sink. dont start before exams...",457.7
"you can denounce your friends. 10/10 would denounce again.",104.6
"very fun. you will easily rack up hours on this tbs. friendly to beginners. gods and kings and brave new world are almost mandatory if you want to use mods from the workshop. there is too much dlc, but the core game should keep you happy for hours and the big expansions (gods and kings, for example) are actually substantial.",114.4
"terrible without dlc. good thing im not poor. 10/10",517.0
"i can see why this game is the bargain bin. i am running windows xp but that should not matter. it crashed 4 times before i learned that using the shortcut on the desktop seems to crash it. why didnt i think of that before? every freaking game i play always crashes from the shortcut on the desktop, right? then when it was explaining something in single player, it crashed again. ok, here is a solid rule when making a game: 1. test your damn game to make sure it does not crash. its not that hard you morons. i feel cheated even though i only spent $12. i now have a title i spent $12 for that i cannot play. skip this piece of crap.",0.4
"this game is an epic time devouring modern board game. the orginal civilization gameplay with the new features added by civ 5+ expansion packs gives all new experiences to the old skool world domination urge and lets you develop your empire in new and unique ways.",416.4
"one of the best strategy games out there. its massive, and even beter with the expansions. you can also use a vast selection of mods in the workshop. there is a large content of gameplay mechanics. old units, modern units and even futuristic units are included as you research tecnology and science, choose religion and your peoples government system. you will be playing this game for a long time, hardly gets old. hours pass by in a blink of an eye. its possible to win in any way you like, destroy everyone or friend everyone, be a master in science, you choose. if you like complex strategy games, this is the one for you.",36.2

"kind of like the monopoly of the pc games. except you dont kill your friends or family for buying a property.",165.7
"amazing game. very addictive - i can play it for unhealthy periods of time and it doesnt get old. singleplayer is fun and its easy to play through many times without getting boring because no two games are exactly the same, and multiplayer is also great because it gets competitive when youre with friends. strategy games are not usually my thing but civ v is just great.",271.0
"i enjoy this game very much. very fun turn based strategy game but can be drawn out at times",10.0
"fun game to build your civilization and watch it fall apart. very good 10/10",927.0

"amazing so much new stuff its to good of a strategy game the dificulities have been increased and religion was taken out so its harder to cheat basically",151.2
"the civ series has always been great. the changes that come with civ 5 are, especially hex map and no unit stacking, are massive improvements over previous entries. that being said, i feel that the dilomatic options and resource trading possiblities of civ 4 are superior to civ 5. still a fantastic game that leads the turn-based strategy genre.",675.5
"i purchased this game for me and a friend, we went on multiplayer and it was feckin awesome. this game will never get old and can be played over and over again for endless hours of fun.",36.3

"the wee hours of the morning will sneak up on you while playing civilization v. highly recommended!",86.7
"ive played civ5 since i joined steam and played it for over 420+ hours. it was worth every second. most dlc is worth purchasing when on sale. the actual gameplay is awesome! you can be a warmongerous, scientific, political, religous or culture based civilization, or mix of all! plenty of civilizations and units to choose from especially in the dlcs and expansion packs. the workshop and mods for this game is one of the best in a game i have seen. a bit on the expensive side especially considering in civ4 all of the features that were realesed as dlc for civ5 were already included in civ4. graphics are beautiful, gameplay is fun and challenging, steam trading cards and achievments. as well as a brilliant modding community. 9.5/10",462.5
"was expecting this game to be very similar to civ 4 with a few minor upgrades, boy was i wrong. seems like it was completely overhauled and for the better, already wasted one weekend stuck in it, and heres to many more! 10/10!",19.1
"nothing better than beating up on the americans. bs seal of approval and a solid way to waste a weekend and feel unproductive.",135.8
"great game. i have never played an rts before, but couldnt resist civ 5. there are so many countries, ways to win, etc. i enjoy the fact that i can play against 24 countries in a world sized maps. i can play the political game or i can become a warmonger and take the world by force. easy for people who have never played rts and yet still has enough content to please long time rtsers as well.",43.4
"at first i thought very little, but with time i came to love it!!",100.5
"as one great meme would say.... nuke all the civs!!",27.7

"this game is so good i had no time for a job and there so i quit my job. i soon ran out of money so i had to sell my house to aford the wi-fi. little did i know you have to have a house for wifi so i bought a car and parked outside of mcdonalds for their wifi until they kicked me out of the lot and i moved to a diffrent mcdonalds everytime until i had to sell my car for gas money. little did i know you have to have a car to get gas. so here i was with my laptop and a couple of moneys so i started walking to starbucks and playing there. soon i got hungry and had to use my gas money to buy food i soon ran out of money so i started to sell my belongings and eventraly selling all of my clothes. little did i know you need clothes to be in starbucks. i was kicked out. now here i am behind starbucks hiding in the dumpster writing this review. please buy this game!!!",53.2
"didnt know if i would like this game but friend recommended it while the summer sale was going and im not dissapointed so far. all in all a very good game.",78.9
"this is the civ game with the lowest barrier to entry. the tutorials are nice, the pop-ups informative, and the gameplay very addicting. if youve even thought about playing one of these games, give this a whirl and thank me when 8 hours go by without you knowing. ;)",26.9
"just another turn! i dont think youll realize how accurate this is until you try this game.",190.3
"first off, this game is amazing. you can sink so much time into this and just want to keep going for hours more. i would suggest getting the dlc as it expands on the game wonderfully. but my base review is that this game is definitely a buy.",320.7
"one of the best turned based games ive had the pleasure to play. it runs well though i have had more crashes than i hoped for. the game is fun with friends but can take a lot of time but you can always save it. the only problem i have with (apart from the crashes) is that to fully enjoy the game, you will have to get the dlc, gods and kings and brave new world. though its worth it.",175.3
"this game is great for buying wives losing them in the forest and finding them slayn by internet trolls that look like vin deisal.",55.0
"amazing game with endless hours of gameplay. i havent even bought the dlc yet.",93.2
"so much fun. addictive and educational. yep i said it. learn bits of history witht he vanilla setup of the game. learn how leaders like gnadhi n such were. anyways its a great turn based strategy with a indepth game and great military units. shame i never have time b4 conquering the world to make buildings in citys so much",146.4
"started one game, now have 100s or hours in. this will ruin your life, you wont be able to stop go back now, you can still save yourself! also cross-platform would be nice",49.0
"plz dont attack me im going for diplomatic victory",80.7
"turn based strategy good graphics smooth gameplay. good if you have time to kill....",134.4
"a brilliant game. on the higher levels, it is challenging, yet just as addictive. multiplayer gameplay is amazing, especially with expansion packs enabled, however, make sure you (and your partner/s) have a stable internet connection, as the game may have a tendancy to drop mid-way through. there are many mods available for this game and i adivse you all to check them out. i am an avid fan of sid meier and cannot wat to see what they come out with next. definately recommended.",130.9
"you know the game is good, when you scream death to the queen and im going to burn that , and you are cussing at the monitor because queen elizabeth is being a jerk that keeps asking for your silver.",19.2
"i love civ games and have very much enjoyed this one. though it has some weak points like not being able to stack units its still good.",95.7
"the game feels finished, and plays well. its an improvement over civ 4 in every way, save mutliplayer, which is awful, lacking mod support, animated leader heads, etc. fleshed out multiplayer would be much appreciated.",515.8
"pretty fun for those into strategy games, but will consume hours of your life at a time.",82.5
"great game, but keep in mind youre going to look up and realize 12 hours has gone by and you are only half way done with a civ.",18.7
"awesome to play with few people, but only if you can afford to buy all expantions. if not then simply buy one of previous parts.",256.4
"one of the most wonderful games ive played in ages, while also being humanities first sucsessful attempt at time travel!",307.9
"this is a fantastic game. for me personally, it has everything that a game needs. it is fun to challenge yourself to try new strategies and methods to end with world domination. best of all, you can melt away an entire weekend playing a single game. pros: (these are pros for games in this particular genre) strategy resource management difficulty settings (civs are more irrational the harder the difficulty) endlessness aspect so many achievements cons: repetitive music endlessness heres what im trying to say. this is probably the best casual game i have ever experienced. so go ahead. buy it. who needs a life anyway? buy it. i dare you.",90.0
"this game is fantastic, especially with the expansions. civ v is higly addictive and has great replay value, making it a valuble purchase if you want a game to play in your free time. the online gameplay is challenging, making it more interesting than facing off against ai. overall, this game is exceptional and i would highly recomend getting the expansions along with it.",39.8
"to build a civilization from scratch and pace out human history is completely worth the 1033 hours ive devoted to playing this game! i fully intend to play this game for at least a thousand more hours. 10/10",1035.2

"become emperor of japan, bomb america, initiate pearl harbor 2: electric boogaloo",100.4
"an amazingly well made and fun turn-based game that i would recommend to any and all gamers. i mainly play multi-player with friends but the single-player (especially with the dlc) is great as well.",265.1
"the single best strategy game i have ever played. sessions of this game take a while, but it keeps you enthralled and offers a lot of replay value due to dlc and a huge amount of characters to play. if you have ever enjoyed a strategy game, and have not already played this one, buy this game.",269.3
"youre damn right i recommend this game. it may seem silly with some of its cartoonish interactivity, but, once you get past that, it is one of the most addictive simplistic games ive ever enjoyed within the strategy genre. i play it for hours without even noticing such time has gone by, yet i dont feel my time wasted. i enjoy this game and i believe you will to.",191.0
"very good strategy game.exceeded my expectatons.solid gameplay and easy to learn.9/10",15.6

"cid meierss civilization v is a very good turn based game. you should consider trying out the game. it has a built in multiplayer, and has a very tactical game play.",59.8
"brilliant. i forget to eat/sleep. this may be killing me, but i dont care",420.2
"with the addition of the brave new world expansion, this is easily my favourite civilization game. the graphics are beautiful, gameplay deep, and the units and civilizations plentiful. if youre a fan of civ you should get this now!",55.3
"this game is fantastic...there is so much depth and content.",225.0
"easily one of the best games i have ever played. its just so good.",165.1
"this is an amazing strategy for anyone that likes this genre of games. this game defines and sets the bar for all game like this. a masterpiece and delight the games features make you feel like you are creating that civilization. if you do not own this game than you are missing out on endless ways to rule the world. multiplayer can support up to 12 players (i think) which can make you turn on your friends or make new ones. this game has hours and hours of fun and i wont be able to stop playing for a while. 9.5/10 bad things are the cost and the dlc price $50 for bnw :(",53.4
"an excellent turn-based-strategy game. some mechanics are a bit weak or ill conceived (the culture system introduced in brave new world is haphazard and breaks the team-based victory conditions if youre playing with an allied player, the religion and un systems from god and kings are limited and rarely justify pursuing them); but most mechanics have been streamlined a lot from civ4 to make them far more intuitive and fun. civiv certainly has more complexity, and arguably depth; but civ5 is definitely the better game, and well worth getting.",185.7
"one more turn cant hurt. (12 hours later) oh ! did i just play for 12 hours straight?!! -classy idiot",20.1

"a fantastic game with an awesome expansion and great game-play and mechanics! the mods are really something out of this world and make the game really fun and enjoyable to play in new perspectives!",130.5
"10/10. best time travel simulator 2086. i once started a game of civ, and when i stopped, it was several months later. a really good game can get you up to ten years into the future. some say a perfect one can actually take you into omnitime and actually reverse and go back. i reccomend this.",343.4
"i must say, if there is any game that i own that i can say is also a time machine, this is it. ill sit down at 12pm so i can get a quick match in. i look at my phone what feels like a short time later and ive missed dinner. i wholeheartedly reccomend this game if youre on the fence about buying it.",258.1
"this game is really fun would recomend to everyone :)",187.2
"sid meiers civ v is a must own game. personally, i would have never seen myself playing this game. but i bought it on sale one day and i can say its one of my top games. its a fun, well made, and all around enjoyable game. the different civilazations create a different game every time you start one up. the variety is really really relaxing as you dont feel a grind, or a sense of repetition. the gameplay it self is awesome. turn based game with lots of things happening at once. you build up your civ. and your battle it out with other civs, or you may go a passive route and win economically or culturally. plus there is awesome online play which make it really fun to battle it out versus friends or team up with friends and fight other ai or users. must have!",145.1
"always a good time, i go back to it for a civ binge at least once or twice a year.",142.8
"if you buy a game purely from how much hours you get from it, this game should be worth 100+. its  how much time i spent the first week i got this game. i spent the whole first week playing this game. wake up, play, eat, sleep. wake up, play, eat, sleep. for a week. for one game of civ. just buy it if you want to lose the rest of your days. it is now belong to sid meier.",66.6
"trust me when i say that this game will make you play until its 2 am, its that fun. if you want to play a turn-based-stratigic game that grows in time when you play it longer, this game is for you! if you want to play as a japanese warlord, this game is for you! if you want to destroy all nations in your way wihtout feeling guilty about it, this game is for you! (also it has giant robots of death. dont belive me? play the game and youll see.)",48.0
"great game. it gets boring after a while so try some mods out. 7/10",134.7
"i know this aint a review,but i just wanted to say...if you love strategy games,history games,etc. this game is the one you need. its even better with the dlc. 8/10 why 8? well,the multiplayer isnt fully enjoyable... 10/10 would be threatened by gandhi with nucklear warfare",42.9
"welp what can i say this was actually my first game on steam and would you look at that 200 hours later and suddenly im writing my first review on that very same game ! seriously though this game is addicting as it gets its almost impossible to stop in between a session (unless you are playing a marathon game) !great game, great replayabilty, lots of fun ! i also heavily advise in buying the dlc adds lots of content !",244.5
"a fantastic game, well worth buying it. best played with all dlc and a bunch of friends.",315.4
"this game may literaly be my favorite turn based stratagy and i play it more than any of my other games on here or on my xbox/ps4. i like this game because its so interactive, you can just get so into andaddicted to this game in such a short amount of time. what i dislike is how the dlc is lik $30 thats silly that just as much as the game costs maybe even more than the game but they are worth it nontheless.",243.1
"ah, civ v. kind of disapointing in the feature it lacked compared to iv, but has made itself up for that in the two main dlc so far. the first one got up to nearly par with iv and the second surpassed it. i also love the combat more by making unit groups more important than just stacking a bajillion units in one stack. mind you, you still needed artillery, but you get the idea. it is a much more interesting system when it involves more around units specifics. id suggest this to any 4x lover.",337.3
"every game is different, thats why i enjoy this game so much",86.5
"very fun game. it mixes the fun of building a civilization and conquering the world together. it has different things you can do like go for the science victory. there are quite a few victorys and characters making the game interesting. it generates new maps so you will have a new experience every time. i would give this game a 9 out of 10. i highly recommend you buy this game.",238.6
"i have played all of sid meier`s civilization and civ 5 is an improvement like the rest of the previous iterations. here are the keynote features in my opinion. pros ------ better ui good tutorials customizable tooltips for different levels of civ experience damage tables on difficulties are more balanced useful spawn tendencies for nations new faith attributes and useful religion customizable religion aspect cons ------ often unpredictable ai basic spawn rate for uranium is quite low faith can only be spent on pre-industrial units ******************************************************************************** i have very little to say about the game except for it`s a great game to play with friends. the online servers are great and makes it easy to play a game with strangers. im a long time player of civilization and i`m glad to see the series is still growing strong. 9.2/10",139.1
"a very fun and easily recommended game. sid meiers civilization v is a game sorta like age of empires where you build up a colony and then fight. the replay ability is awesome but there is something you must know. this game can get tedious. one game took me 2 days to complete. it was lots of fun while playing but i had to do tons of upgrades. it is really fun though and i recommend playing with your friends. 8/10!",2.7
"although it may fail at simulating history, civilization v makes it up for being a deep and highly addictive turn based strategy game. if you only have the base game, the game will have some rough edges and frustrating features, but both gods & kings and brave new world improved the game so much that it made itself one of my favourite games of all time. the many options and resources this game has may overwhelm anyone who is new to the game or the genre, but all these options give an immense amount of fun and unique strategies that makes every game unique. together with an always randomly generated map and ai opponents with all different strategies, causes this game to never bore and wish you could play this game till deep in the night.",410.6

"why must i download the game that i own the cd for?! steam suxxxxxx!!!!!!!",0.7
"this game is simply awesome. the art is good, and while there is no story, you get the feeling that you have the power to write it yourself through the actions you take in civilization. my only qualm is that it can be a little buggy at times, particularly in multiplayer (good god). the gameplay is also very enjoyable and fun.",145.2

"this game is as unrefined and buggy as civ 4 bts is a perfected icon of turn based strat games. i keep gettin many turns into the games and see automated workers taking up space in cities when work is to be done or when you take manual control they require orders every turn. pos really after 100s of hours of playing, ive had it. so i got my moneys worth and if i could do it over again, i wouldnt buy it.",800.1

"the popularity and longetivity of the civilization series kinda speaks for itself, but civ v once again raises the bar for the 4x strategy games genre. the level of customization, of choices given for different kind of experiences makes it the one game i replayed the most. there are many difficulty levels which, at higher levels, give you very challenging game where you need to be a master at geopolitical control and making the best out of all little advantages you got while compensating for your disadvantages. there are many concepts, old and new, that can help you build your civilizations. religion, cultural policies, tourism, happiness, diplomatic relations, trade, sciences, ideologies ... the combinations are almost endless. once again, a civ game i have played (too?) much of !",380.9

"civilization v is an absolutely massive game. the dlc gives you lots of stuff to play around with, and i recommend that you get the complete edition, with all of the dlcs but after you get bored of the official stuff, or even before youre bored of the official stuff, you can get mods! if you dont know how expansive the mod community of civ v is, then just check out the steam workshop for civ v. thats only a small part of the mods available for civ v, you just have to jump in and start playing!",187.9

"having played all the civilization titles from the start, including the spinoffs, i definitely will say i have enjoyed civ v the most. many of the questionable mechanics have been refined, and playing militarily actually takes strategy as opposed to unit spamming.",166.2
"lots of fun single or multiplayer, like all civ games",87.8
"civ v, visually more attractive than previous civs, seems not as immersive and deep. the addition of ranged units that can attack across multiple tiles is nice, the city states and barbarians are interesting. definitely worth picking up this game if you catch it on sale, but when its at full price, stick with previous versions.",433.6

"after 200 hours of playtime in civ 5, im still playing the game a ton and enjoying it. this game has so much diversity and depth to it that you can immerse yourself in it for hours on end. this is arguably the best strategy game ever made and has a lot of replayability. i recommend this game to anyone and you can play multiplayer and enjoy the game with friends.",316.5

"prepare to spend 5-6 hours on this game without realizing youve been on for more than an hour. one more turn really does become a mantra that dominates your thinking. that said, the number of possible game setups and possibilities results in nearly endless gameplay.",407.2

"dont ever play this  vanilla. thats a mistake. boy get the expansions, both if you can but at least gods and kings. now lets build an empire.  your workers were stolen by barbarians. go find their bandit campm all right, there it is. lets get our worker back, yeah? warriors and archers all up on that camp! get rekt bandit nerds! hahaha! yeah, now we can finally improve some tiles and maybe build that great library you wanted.... the great library has been built in a far away land.",524.9

"the game has its share of ups and downs, but with the addition of g&k and bnw, it really shines. i like the endless options that you can choose to play with, and the endless ways you can play each civ. overall, i would recommend this game to anyone with a lot of extra time on their hands. when its full screen, its easy to lose track of time!",81.7
"one of my favorite games of all time. you can literally spend 6 hours straight playing this game. one more turn is what the game is all about. the dlc also makes the game a lot more fun, and there are a lot of cool mods out there if you find the game becomes a bit bland over time.",218.0

"my first game on steam, and by far, one of the best games i have played. when i first got this civ v i almost cried myself to sleep. i felt as if it was slow, a waste of money and at the time i was more intereted in rtss. after the rts craze ended, i stumbled across this game again. after 10 minutes of playing, i thought why did i ever say no. it is pretty obvious to see that this game was well planed out, nice animations and graphics, suits playing styles (diplomatic, economic, military, science and even cross styles have advantages.) and hud is very nice too. the menus are easy to navigate and ingame. multiplayer is its only downfall, tbs, what did i expect. enough said. this game is fun and a massive time consumer. if you have enough time on your hands, then this is deffinitly for you. 9/10",94.9
"you cant go wrong with a civ game. civ v tries a few things different from the ealier games such as hex-based gameplay and city states. great strategy game now with steamworks (achievements and cloud), but theyve also turned a lot of the civilizations into dlcs.",82.8

"if you love em you love em, if you hate em you hate em. they are what they are. civ v is no disappointment as a successor to the series.",237.1
"the game feels finished, and plays well. its an improvement over civ 4 in every way, save mutliplayer, which is awful, lacking mod support, animated leader heads, etc. fleshed out multiplayer would be much appreciated.",515.8

"gorgeous graphics and deep combat make this a great place to start or renew your interest in global domination.",28.3
"civilization v is a great game but with out the dlcs is a unfinished game that may disappointfans coming from civ iv. but of course with the dlc it turned this unfinished game into a spectacular experiance that any civilization fan should have. it has a dumbed down ui from civ iv but thats what all the games are doing so you gotta deal with it. the main point is you have to get the dlc to see the full potential of this game or else you may be left unsatisified with the gameplay. pros: -good gameplay on single and multi -easy to ui for new players -great dlcs that are worth the $30.00 -constant replayebility -great community content on workshop and easy to use map editor cons: -dumb and random ai behaviour -multiplayer session lag and disconnect oftan making it sometimes unplayable -to easy to play in even the hardest modes - not enough stratigic resources 8.5/10 get this game civilization fans!!!",344.7
"this game is addicting it turns someone who hated turn based strategy games into an addict of them and its amazing...might want to not start a game of it before you go to bed because you will stay up all night and play it this is a very long game but i recommend it to everyone! it also is steam workshop enabled so that means you can mod it up and play on the same maps as tamriel in elder scrolls and the lands in the lord of the rings! giant death robot nuff said",170.8

"this game is so good, that the fact that you are spending time reading reviews and not buying the game is a shame and a waste of good play time. once you accuire the game you will understand what it means to press next turn just one more time, until you realize it is 6am.",192.6

"better than a bacon and sausage sandwich :) (probably)",571.8
"what can i say about civilization v... i am not a big fan of the strategy genre, yet this game has that charm, which makes me play it, makes me interested on how my civilization will live on. the game is really slow-paced, yet the time really flies playing it. graphics are pretty good, considering its a strategy game. this game pretty much never gets repetitive, everytime you can start differently, and win differently. only thing i dislike- 1 leader for entire civilization in ages. it kinda doesnt make sense to me, because the same leader living thousands of years... its weird. because of that, id rate this game a solid 9.5/10, i highly suggest you buy it.",26.9
"amazing strategy game. cant describe how much fun you can have and how well thought the game is all around.",208.9
"best strategy game ive ever played, one of my favorite games ever. mods, scenarios, and different victory types allow for basically endless gameplay. definitely get it if you havent already. the expansions, gods and kings and brave new world, are worth their asking price and make the game much better.",215.7
"i have played civilization since the very first one and after spending $60 on this game when it came out i am sad to say i will no longer be playing this series. the best game in the series by far is civilization iv (4). civilization v (5) ruined every aspect of the series that i found entertaining. i cant mass my units, the hex system is a huge bummer, and the game is slow and clunky. they needed wayyy more polish than they were willing to put into it for being a major game series. i read an article online where the lead game designer even admitted that he messed up, which just confirmed what i already know, this game sucks. thanks for ruining my hopes of playing civilization in the future. ps- would love to get my $60 back from this terrible game.",16.6

"do you like stategy games? do you like board games? well then look no further, friend. welcome home. civilizations 5th iteration is a great entry in this franchise and is addictive as it is fun. prepare to loose many hours. some may tell you this one is a weaker game than 4 or not worth playing without all the dlc. i am not really in that group. i had a lot of fun with the vanilla game. the expansions add depth to mid and late game stages and provide more options for victory, along with new civilizations (each which has its own perks). if you have even a mild itch for strategy games then press buy. also note this game is very moddable - all supported by steam workshop. which couldnt be easier to use.",45.4

"love this ga,e, just the right pace for an old guy like me.",198.8
"well... over 18 hours into the game, and i barely have finished the tutorial and 1 game. need i say more ? alright. apart from its extensive playtime, the gameplay mechanics are excellent, the game is very easily modable (thanks to steam workshop, you can play campains on wwii, lord of the rings, game of thrones and so on), easy to set up as you want, a game can last (from what ive seen) between 10mn and 9+ hours, im sure this is even not a lot compared to what you can do. the mechanics are really easy to learn, but seem to be hard to master. and once you grow tired of being pwned by the computer, you can also get pwned by other players online ! thats wonderful. this game is truly a masterpiece, and should be in every strategy fan library !",40.5

"this game made me believe in magic again. this game made my  grow three sizes in just three weeks! this game brought my granddad back to life. he played and had heart attack at the sheer thrill that he could manage citizens in the city. hes dead now, burried with a redeemable code to civ 5 in his grave. dem trade routes... dose quotes... dat alternate history? 10/10 would . and the mods! the mods actually make the game fundamentaly better. they are not just window dressing. they are a thing of beauty and the people who make them should be given the medal of honor. ive wasted so much time on this game that i could have been wasting on other things and i suggest you do the same.",350.2
"great game. played hours and hours on it by myself and with friends.",65.8
"everyones reviwes are good but im finding this game really boaring, idk if its beacuse i only played 3 hours but its just a bad birds eyes viwe with slow moving people and i destroyed this guys city but dosnt get destroyed / taken over. it just stays alive. :/ idk if im doing somthing wrong. but like i said, i have only played like 3 hours.",3.1

"civ v is a black hole of human life; ive spent hundreds of hours revising human history (and more often than not delivering a swift nuclear coup de grace to its menial suffering). if you can hobble together a few reliable friends, and are willing to invest a handful of doomed games to learn the basics, theres nary a fellow who cant or wont love this frankenstein of marriage-killing fun.",526.7
"its an extremely fun and addictive game that gets really into the gameplay as well as the ability to play as one of the great leaders youve heard or read about also makes it one of the top notch games there have been",36.1
"only complaint: the ai has no idea how to play this game. i have a feeling that because of that, neither do i. its definately faster than iv. and the visuals and audio is great. youll see the shuffling around hoplites in 1866, but if that bothers you, turn up the difficulty so it gets some unfair help.",294.4

"while the game gets a little bit repetitive in its gameplay over time, every playthrough is different enough to keep players interested. the game is challenging, fun, and captivating. it is also highly, highly addictive. the dlcs really add to the gameplay, but the game is still fun without them. highly reccomended, 8.5/10.",41.2

"civ v is a unike game. i have played this game alot because it brings a lot of old memories back from age of empires. just with a few friend you can get more than 30 hours of fun easely. you can make the game hard or easy because the ais are just soo good! :d",182.1
"i think this games is what it is and isnt what it isnt. this game is a strategy game that you can get lost in for hours. the charators are very well do and the game just feels complete. you really cant go wrong buying this game. however, if you want a game that will put you on the edge of you seat this is not the game for you. this game moves slow and nothing really happens quickly. for example it takes at lease 7 turns to take a city. but this game does what it does so well i think its worth ever cent.",71.5
"i got this game in the 2013 summer sale it is so good that i would have payed around 60-90 dollars to play it.",180.7

"this is an amazing game. ruling the world couldnt be more fun. has the option to play a more casual quick game, or a more hardcore long game (can take days to finish). great game. hours and hours of possible gameplay, and there are almost always good deals on it. buy it!!",106.0
"great game - must have with brave new world dlc (pretty cheap now). turn based, like a game of chess - with politics and war.",793.6
"i have only played civ v for about 2 hours now, having never played a single game of sid meiers, let alone really and turned based strat games in general. so far i can tell and understand why the hype for this game is so big. yes at first it seems like it has a decently big learning curve, i was kind of overwhelmed at first with what i was supposed to be doing etc. but the nice thing about it is that instead of having to go through a huge tutorial for an explanation, it tells you what you should be doing while you are starting off your country. i like it a lot!",33.4
"this game is my favorite game in my library out of 30-40 games. it will bring endless hours of gameplay and non stop strategical situations that you will have to surpass to be a great leader. keeps your brain circulating options/ideas and this game will bring stress due to all the situations that come into play. love this game. classic",90.2
"one of the best strategy games of all time. a beautiful work of art where you muct make hard decisions and actually feel like you are a leader. will you be a good king? an evil empoerer? or a neutral dictator who chooses to be blind to he outside world? will you raise an army to roll over all nations? or will you choose to work in harmony for a peaceful world? its all up to you!",58.4

"this game- for little i have to say im terrible at it. but one thing this game did was impress me with its overwhelming amount of features, ive only scratched the surface! this game seeks to amaze me and delivers which is why it gets a seal of approval. i rate it around 5/5 (perfect score!)",66.1
"you guy should get this its so much fun with multiple people.",32.0
"this is one of those games where you start playing, then look up at the clock and say ive been playing for ten hours?!. if you like deep, immersive, and time-consuming strategy games, you need to be playing civilization.",110.2
"over the years (and the expansions/dlcs) this game has become better and better. the one-more-turn-feeling is hard to resist and this game is as deep as it gets. i highly recommend getting the addons, as they really add to the experience. also, civ is often on sale, so that shouldnt be a problem. this game offers hundres of hours of gameplay youll love, if you like turn-based strategy games. by the way, i think that its kind of odd that people who spent more than 500h with civ claim that they cannot recommend this game",370.3
"one of the best games ive played in a while. the bnw dlc adds some interesting gameplay elements in addtion to finely tuning the rest of the game.",282.9
"excellent game. the best rts game for me. nice graphic, mechanism, gameplay and special unit like xcom and death mech robot... (you can see xcom unit vs pikeman...haha)",48.6
"the best strategy game i know. the depth of gameplay and plethora of information the game gives you is topped only by the ability to micro-manage your civilisation. at first the game seems to overroll you with its complexity but once you get the hang of it you wouldnt want anything less! a game you will be still playing ten years from now!",302.2
"great game but will eat up time quickly. havent played a civ game since civ ii, just turned this on and 4.2 hrs later i stopped. jeeze i need to watch the time better.",162.9

"this has been one of my favorite games ive played and has been incredibly addiciting. the amount of detail and work that went into this game is extraordinary. while i did play civilization iv before, this game seemed entirely new and revamped. it is somewhat dificult to learn because of its complexity but once learned is a very entrenching and enjoyable game. my one complaint would be some issues with the ai in that there are many times in which units forget what they were automated to do. very fun game, nontheless.",113.6

"great game. hex tile element adds new depth to the usual square grid.though the movement controls are a litte wierd ad the character selection will jerk you all over the map once your empire is massive, it is a great strategy game derserving of a 9/10",216.4
"this is one of the best games ive ever played. my friends and i love playing this. i reccomend this game to everyone.",119.2
"love this game. game play is excellent, but i do miss the cheats from previous version. i dont like that i have to run steam on mac to play it, the software slows down my computer, runs with out my consent, has to be manually configured to not launch whenever boot the machine for example.",81.8

"i have owned civ v now for almost two years, and it has always been nothing but awesome. even more awesome now with the brave new world dlc, and the addition of religion, spies, congress, tourism, trade routes, etc. this has made the game even more interesting. i lose track of hours on this, building my economy, while trying to build my army and not breaking the bank in the process, watching other civilizations machinations with my spies, and increasing border expansion to an all-time high without pissing off my neighbors. it is indeed very complex and i am always learning new tips and tricks. besides skyrim, this is most definitely my favorite game on steam. i give it 10/10 cupcakes.",141.9

"slow and meticulous but draws you in. fun like risk with friends on a late saturday night.",7.2
"one of my all time fav games, this requires you to have a stong economy while ballencing other aspects of your empire on multuple fronts. not only is this game diplomaticaly focoused it also has extreme focous for combat and war situations aswell. for example your units gain a bonous for attacking from a hill and can often not attack with indirect fire... if i had to make one complant i would say that some of the civs need a little re-ballancing other then that if you are a stratigist then you need to pick this game up 9.5/10",240.9

"civilization 5 is one of the most recent additions to civilization series, which has been defining the rts genre for decades. if you have not played a civilization game before; civilization 5 is a great starting point. amazing game! sooo much fun single player, more fun with a friend! the expancion packs are a great addition to the original game and add alot more depth and complexity to the game. if you are new to the game consider playing without the expancion packs at first, and then add them on. i would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of rts games, is looking for a great single player experience, or has a group of friends to play with; as both the single player and multi player are hours of fun. 10/10.",243.4
"i have never played any games in this series but honestly, i think this is my favorite strategy games. you take contol of you own civilization and choose if you want to be a militaristic empire or if you want to become allies with all the city states you find. i recommend this game to everyone. ive been hooked ever since i started playing.",46.8
"very addictive and a different game everytime you restart.",6.5
"got to play the game during steams free period. i was a long time player of civ iii. getting the chance to play civ v even without the dlc was a good thing. i spent 24 hours in a single game over the course of two days. always had to get that next turn in. the only negative i can think of is in the interaction with other countries. not really a negative but it is a different experience than civ iii and tooks some time to get use to. never did find a means to perform any spy tactics. overall i enjoyed it. i was set to win by score, culture or space. the space ship managed to be built first.",371.8
"an easy way to spend hours alone or with friends! this is an overall awesome multiplayer strategy game.",100.4

"the defining modern civilization simulator. everything is excellent, makes even the best computers hot with all the amazing engine work and calculations it does.",452.7
"there are three dominant reasons why i recommend this game: 1. no micromanaging 50,000,000,000 things per turn later in the game, unlike other turn-based strategy games like rome: total war ii. a lot of game mechanics are autonomous, making smooth turn-by-turn play. 2. nicola tesla is a great engineer in this game. he has done some great stuff for humanity, if you arent aware. 3. there is a game of thrones mod for this game. there are freakin game of thrones factions and characters in it. that is amazing. if you dont think it is amazing, go make love to your sister/brother/father/mother/aunt/uncle/nephew/etc. and then try to tell me with a straight face that it is not amazing.",195.4

"95 out of 100 i definatly like the turn based play because it gives a refreshing change from the real time stratagy games i usually play. it can be a little repetetive playing against the computer though so try playing it with others for variety.",110.7
"strategy smart game lots of civilizations good sound",7.5
"this is real laggi and sheet. bi ths fukin game asshol",96.6
"i love turn based strategy games and this is one of the best without containing too much detail like some of the other games. these type of games are great for those who are looking to be able to walk away from the game at a moments notice without any problem (except if playing multiplayer).",418.1
"great game, recommend it because its free. main issue is how slowly you earn certs to get better equipment to get more certs.",192.3
"civilization v is probably the best balance of in depth customization mixed with easy accessablility. it can be as hard as you want it to be, or it can be very easy to allow you to learn the mechanics. ive played through a few games, and im very impressed with the way this game feels and plays. i know when it comes to civilization games, nostalgia runs wild and everyone always thinks the older ones are superior. but i honestly think, combined with at least the gods and kings expasion, this is the best civilization game to date. if youre interested in this game, you have to at least get the gold edition. this game feels pretty incomplete without the gods and kings expansion, but with it, it feels perfect. i havent gotten brave new world, but i hear it is amazing. anyway, civilization v is highly recommended by me, and should be picked up by any strategy/civilization fan.",28.7
"9/10 best rts game i have played. i like how it goes through all of time into the modern era. so basically, you go from killing with spears, to f*cking nukes. it has very minor flaws which are not worth pointing out because they do not effect the overall experience. in conclusion, it is amazing for its intelligent way of having the player build the idel nation to their liking, no matter the leader you pick.",35.0
"im not even good at games like civ, but civ v has me coming back to it again and again because its just plain fun. ive lost hours upon hours building empires and theyve just flown by. one of the most engrossing games you can buy on steam, but you probably already knew that; it is civ, after all.",29.6
"bought this through humble bundle and enjoyed it so much i added the extra ~5$ to get the full tier. this is my first experience with a civ game and i have passed on them before because i thought it was to complex. but starting from the lowest difficulty and work your way up seems to have worked this far. the only negative i can think about, except the ais evil trading, is that it magically turns one more turn to 3am in the morning.",34.7
"i recommend this game, sadly when i was in sweden... the pirated version is a lot quicker on fixing bugs than the company. i bought two of these games because they did not accept donations and are probably mad that sweden allows pirating.",155.2
"the time flies when i play this ! super recomended!!!!",127.7

"although i miss a few things from civ 4, its an amazing game from an amazing series. since no-ones ever made a remake of alpha centauri, this is the best 5x game.",332.9
"sid meiers civilization is a series that has, deservedly, garnered many fans for its unique and enthralling strategic gameplay. all you ever want to do in civ v is press that end turn button one more time. brave new world makes everything so much better and adds a layer that was previously missing. but with civilization v, comes the knowledge that this world is one that we must share and with that come the responsibility of knowing that the decisions we make today will have a lasting impact on the generations of tomorrow.",114.1

"one of the best and hardest strategy games ive ever played, but the one downside to this amazing game is that it gets very redundant.",167.5
"first off, i played civ4 before this and i really enjoyed it. now civ5 got more content, like nukes, changed some things around, like that only one military unit can stay on one tile and of course upgraded the graphics. but it is still sid meiers civilization, you start of with settlers and warriors and play from 4000 b.c. to the near future +2100. play with one or up to 11 other players on one map! but this time around, there are city states, you can either be allies with them and enjoy their benefits or fight them and annex their city. what i also liked is that you can find natural wonders, which when worked on by the city benefits you with faith. for new players, they put the effort in to make advisors, but as soon as you know the basics, they get really annoying. overall a great game, but you better of with the dlc. this game gets an g for good.

"civilization 5 is a very good game, no doubt, but there were some flaws that made it not as the first game, civilization revelution.",16.1
"sid meiers civilization v, known to the community as civ 5 is in my opinion one of the top five games i have ever played. it has the perfect amount of strategy and depth. civ 5 gives you hours of enjoyment, and will bring you a giddyness undescribable by human emotions and words. if you are waffeling with the desision. buy. this. game.",109.3
"an extremely complex strategy game that sucks you in with its mesmerizing depth and unregulated pacing. it may seem overwhelming at first but you will find yourself glued to this game for hours while surrendering former real-world provisions such as food and sleep. the only major shortcoming this game has is the ai, which is often irrational at best and stupid at worst. the game clearly favors war over diplomacy, but regardless there is more than enough strategy to last you for hundreds of hours.",332.6
"this is one jewel of a game. this has to be the greatest kingdom managing sim out there, if you get the expansion packs then it is the best. i wish it had most of the expansion pack fetures at start, and that kinda feels like a money grab. but the money is worth it.",30.0

"awesome strategy game that really gets you thinking. i love the history,art,and thought put into this game. the game feels overall pretty well balanced civilizations and societal and political trees,few have game breaking advantages can be found as opposed to some rts. its a great game to sit back and play a week long game vs a few computers a few steps at a time with, or to go at it with friends and try to conquer the world. great visuals, music in these games isnt usually my thing. looking forward to grabbing the dlcs",15.4

"great turn based strategy game. its relatively user driven, in that you can make one game last for 10 hours or 100 hours, whatever your preference. you can fly through the game using auto productions and other ease features, but there are great opportunites for micromanaging galore if that is your suit. loads of dlc make the game a lot more fun, especially the addition of religion, as well as the reworked global political system, cultural victory, and diplomatic victory, as seen in the brave new world expansion. i would suggest playing on prince difficulty or above however. aside from learning the game, anything lower then that is rather broken in terms of ease of victory. watch out for ghangis khan.",206.3

"if youre a fan of previous civs or enjoy playing long multiplayer games, i highly recommend against buying this game. while very pretty, civ v is essentially a simplified version of civ iv and has much lower replay value. i can understand the design choices made with this game, in terms of attracting new players and maximizing profits, but it doesnt feel or play like an authentic civilization game; its more of a civ-themed reinterpretation of the genre, aimed at casual gamers. for the price, and having to pay extra for core game features carved into dlcs; this game was not worth my money, nor my time. back to a heavily modded civ iv i go...",149.7

"this is the strategy game ive waited for a long time. challlenging concepts but easy to master controls makes you feel like you hold the civilization in your hand. best of all is that multiplayer with friends and players is even more exciting by adding a whole other level of depth and mystery to the game. for anyone interested in strategy or military games this game is an essential for your personal game collection. happy gaming!",90.1

"this game is addictive as hell! if you will buy it you will spend the crazy amount of hours to play it. just alone or with friends. this is this type of game which you can play many many times and will be always different. i have played only very old civ 2 which was amazing game. but civ v is just must have for people who love the strategy games. just buy it. you wont regeret it.",355.4

"just as ridiculously frickin addictive as all the others. sigh.",753.7
"what the hell! i have played civ iii for long time, i have not playde civ iv, so i dont know what thats like. first thing i see, is that starting a game is simplified a lot. then i start a game, what the f*ck, why is here this stupid guide telling me that i should build a city, why, no other civ game i have played had sh*t like that! i dont need no guide, and if you cant play without a guide, you should not play a complicated strategy game. then i tried to manage my city, but the managing thing was simplified too, i could not do anything else than choose what to build, also, i heard i have less than 2 citizens. do not buy this game unless you want another casual piece of garbage! [edit] that was my first reaction, this is actually really good game when you turn off guides and stuff.",49.2
"0 out of a million i have to pay money to play sweden",5.2
"this has proven to be one of my absolute favourite games. its difficult to put my finger on exactly what is so wonderful about civ v, but i can say that it has the best replayablity value on anything ive ever played. single player is smooth and refined, and every playable civ is perfectly balanced. every map offers a reasonable challenge, and there are multiple ways to win a game. for me, civ v really gets fun in multiplayer with some friends. the multiplayer can be a little touch-and-go, but that was hugely improved in the last few patches. with pitboss multipalyer being run from a stable connection, most of the problems associated with civ vs multiplayer are circumvented. i cannot recommend this game highly enough. if youre waiting to be swayed, get this game. it offers hours upon hours of entertainment.",167.5

"a great strategy game for all ages. i strongly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys watching something grow over a long period of time. the graphics are good, a.i. is great and the diversity is fantastic. though it takes a lot of patience, it is a great game when you have developed your civilisation. 9.5/10",39.0
"well i was gandhi and i blew everyone else the f*ck up.",56.9
"great social strategy game. the engine creates a pretty easy-going sort of playstyle. artwork is decent, and so is variety. the diplomacy in the game does not have much depth to it, and creating a lasting alliance with another faction is a rarity. there is also the problem with turn processing, at later turns (150+), you may aswell tab out of the game, as you might be waiting over 5 minutes for the game to end the turn and start a new one. still very enjoyable, 8/10.",123.2
"it took me 104 hours, but i finally won my first civ 5 game. as george washington, world leader, i wiped ghandi off the map before he could screw me over like usual. using my christian nuclear arsenal, i erased him from history. when his epitaph played and america immediately immediately began a golden age despite everyone in the world denouncing me, i popped a raging boner making all 104 hours worthwhile.",107.1

"one more turn. thats what you will keep saying even when you know you have to stop. be it total world domination or establishing diplomatic alliances, civilization is the foundation of empire dynasty building throughout the ages. the feeling of going from a group of settlers with only sticks and stones to reaching for the stars in their rockets is still not lost in this 5th outing. with new crisp and easy to distinguish detailed graphics this game is nothing but superb.",15.1

"one more move !! haha great in depth game. emerges you in your own story telling (if you let it). top notch dlc of brave new world. hours and hours and hours of fun and hours you must educate yourself on all matters and stages and paths of your conquest (as best you can) .. with the built in in-game guide to everything. also alot of advice from youtube and alike. would have loved a live action game like command and conquer with video cut scenes .",317.6
"while it isnt my favorite game (in the sense that ive played other games more and like to play them more, not that i dislike this game) it is definitely up there on the list. its indefinitely replayable, so that adds to the value of it as well. its fun enough that if you like this type of game, youll probably get caught up enough in it that youll end up playing for hours and hours and realize the sun is going down (or coming up haha). but if you want my opinion, if this game is on sale or something, there really isnt any reason not to buy it at this point.",235.3
"lovely game, beautiful graphics, easy concept, all it needs is a few more empires, a few extra bonuses for each emipre. i love the game, such a great game! i recommend this game to whoever wants to have the best time ever in a strategy game. ***** (five stars!)",262.6
"in my humble opinion civilization has gone worse with each number. if we take a look at the direction, the change is obvious. the game has changed from historical and real to silly and toy/cartoon like. the game has changed from diverse into stupified for those who play console games. lots of options have been taken away on each civ. i want to choose to have 50 aztec civ on super small map if i so like. who are the game makers to say i cant? instead they decide what you want. no thanks.",16.1

"i have been an avid civ player since the first release, and of course i had to have v as well. but i must say i was somewhat disappointed. its not that the game sucks big-time or anything, but i dont like many of the new stuff. firstly i hate the city states. they are way to expensive to be friends with and since war is always a slow and costly procedure in civ, they are not worth invading. i quite frankly dont see their purpose. secondly the new religion creator doesnt appeal to me. the idea is ok, but i get to choose from a lot of perks that are not that well explained, so i end up choosing randomly. its not a terrible game, but i will just go back play civ iii witch in my opinion is the best one yet.",21.4
"civilization v is a game where you make your own civilization and then win.. or lose. when i bought this game one of my friends told me not to do it, ill lose my family. well... he was right. (only as a joke, i didnt actually lose my family) warning: this game is a good game. you will lose many hours of your life to it. i recommend this game for you to play, but make sure you get the complete edition for alot more fun. 10/10 what more could you want then to nuke barbarians?",61.4

"not quite as good at civ iv in some aspects, worlds better than civ iv in others. im still a sucker for some empire earth or age of empires, but as for tbs games in general, civ v has a lot of moving parts, is a very involved game that can take days or a few short hours depending on rules, setup, and play style. good replay value. great with friends.",68.7

"firaxis took a lot of risks with this game, changing so much from civ 4. however pretty much all of them have payed off, and made the game much better for it. one great change is leaders speaking in their actual language making metting leaders more interesting. no stacking of military units is a massive plus, in civ 4 you were just smashing stack after stack into each other, it felt like there was no strategy. now it is much more interesting and feels like it takes skill. the only real thing i dont like about it is the announcer, he has a very boring voice. no where near as interesting as leonard nimroys.",93.1
"piece of . crashes more than any other game ive played. it is 2015... get your  together.",153.6
"bitterly disappointing. nearly everything that made civ4 a great game has been pared back, and what remains is a shallow and meaningless turn based strategy game where everyone seems at perpetual war with everyone else. corporations, espionage and religion are the main things that i really miss, but also the way that the civ4 leaders all had a personality. now its just like a 10 player (or whatever) skirmish mode with leaders you couldnt care less about and faceless city states that act as nothing but speedbumps on the road to domination. lame, really lame. graphics are sweet, hexes (instead of squares) are good, one unit per hex combat is different (not bad per se), the rest is dumbed down rubbish. its like civ for console kiddies. 4/10.",58.2

"i love this game. if you are into history and always ask yourself the question *what if?* this game gives you the perfect answer. you remake history with whatever civilization you choose. i have spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game and do not regret any of it. some people may not have a lot of fun with the game because of the setup given, for example: polynesians who have advantages at exploring the sea spawning in the middle of a huge countinent. they have to form their empire to make sure they are successful in the end and come out on top. making a religion and being rich might be your key to success in some games, while it may hinder it in others.",1071.6

"really good, i suck balls at it. if you are into turn-based strategy this is your best shot.",49.9
"despite its faults (yes it has them) its a great game. one unit per tile gets rid of the death-stacks of older civ games, but makes it very annoying to move large quantities of units over large distances, especially since the pathing is poorly done. the introduction of airlifting in bnw is nice, but requires an airport in both cities. otherwise, the game is fun and there are plenty of mods to fool around with.",319.6
"this game takes up time, but so does any great strategy game. the only problem i can see with this is you really need either gods and kings or brave new world dlc to fully enjoy it. it may be me playing with it for so long, but whatever. it is really well constructed, gandhi still goes on nuke rampages. ai is pretty well written, graphics and animation are beautiful. it is really just one of the best strategy pc games out there. tenouttaten would recommend to anyone. another note: to fully enjoy graphics you should have a decent pc. that aside, anyone on any computer can enjoy this. enjoy folks!",265.4
"have you ever thought why your parents, friends and even people who pass you in the street hate you. its because you dont own this game. it can be as satisfying as using sandpaper to pleasure yourself and after 50 hours it seems to lack depth. but yeah good clean christian fun.",84.8

"before i started playing, i pictured this game as being kinda like rts games ive played like age of empires. this is more turn-based and strategic than other games, with an emphasis towards building up over a long period of time. and yeah, i mean looooong. games can get fairly lengthy, though its pretty easy to put them on pause, even in multiplayer. theres definitely a learning curve, and while the tutorials are adequate for the basics, theres a lot of nitty gritty stuff that trips you up the first few games. overall, this is a great game for turn-based strategy, with lots of replayability, especially if you can get a couple of friends to join you for a long evening session.",92.3

"this has got to be one of my favorite games of all time. the different people you can be, the terrain, and even the graphics are stellar. also the ammount of modifications that people have made and will make are also off the charts amasing because not only do they enhance the game but they also allow new players to get better by practising to slowly work their way off the modifcations",239.8
"after playing this game for a long, long, long time. i can definitely say it was worth my money and time. i loved next to every aspect of it from watching gandhi start a war with england and k.oing england, to watching barbarians steal a great general and destroying a tank.",91.0
"very absorbing. one game could mean a whole day wasted on this game",171.6
"excellent gameplay, a must-have for every strategy fan!",258.2
"i recently got this game, i was expecting myself to never get the hang of it but holy jesus! i really cant stop playing its impossible to stop, i got the hang of it perfectly in at least 4 hours which is very good to understand every little thing thats in the game. its the first time ive ever played the franchise and its good i popped in at this stage in the franchise. might i add... the best part of the game is going past 2013 :d 10/10",78.4
"fantastic game the dlc makes it even better very worthwhile. it requires a lot of thinking especially at higher difficulty. there are some great mods for the game in the steam workshop and it is probably my favourite game of all time. i have put more than 500 hours into the game so far and am still playing.",706.2
"i dont know if its my computer or the game,but its not letting me play.",87.7
"this game is somewhat enjoyable, but with its frequent crashes (just about every 5 minutes) and multitude of bugs, i would call it a waste of money. also, the steam forum for this game is full of people saying that they are experiencing these crashes. it may have something to do with windows 8.1.",25.5

"yet another fantastic game from firaxis. sids games all have this one more turn charm, which will eventually get you to play till 6 am in your underwear and desperatley needing sleep. every civ is unique and has its own playstyle, and the difficulty levels are balanced. this game is one of the games i love and will keep playing until i move out or have better things to do. 9/10 would kiss again",285.7

"8/10 this game takes so much time off your day and it is still so much fun, even though you just sit there and use one hand (just like watching adult films).one game takes hours, and that is when your settings are on quick mode (well i am not really sure, i am a casual gamer, not really competitive). fun with friends. it is always so much fun building your own empire, whether you overpower your enemy or just simply build a utopia for your people and win through peace, the game is awesome. p.s. just press next turn already...",32.4
"i dont understand how i have played this game for so long in the two days i have had it. this takes me back to age of empres: age of kings but just adds more visuals and a such a good games mechanics formula that i cannot even comprehend how addictive this game is and how long a game of civ actually lasts. it feels like i am living out the civilisation with how many hours i spend making scenarios happen like americans vs native americans and england vs germany. will not be able to put this game down any time soon.",15.3

"attack one city, become hated by the world. kill everyone to change their minds. 8/10 great genocide simulator.",68.4
"im not going to say its a bad game, because its definitely not; theres a lot of thought behind its design and the strategy therein. but i will say its a game i do not enjoy playing, and that mostly comes down to it taking way too long to get anything done; i always get bored and quit before i finish a single campaign...",14.4
"civilization v is the fifth installment in arguably the best stratgy series ever. though people argue that its prdecessor, civ 4, was much better. but is it really. so in civ 5 you essentially pick an emeror ie; napolean and build a civilization. people say that civ 4 was better, because there were much more elements. yes, in civ 5 they did take a lot of eleents that civ 4 had, but if you are willing to get the dlc brave new world, you may get that civ experience that you were wanting all along with better graphics. you should definnitely pick this game up if you havent, you can get it really cheap of amazon or in the steam sales, in my opinion this is one of the best strategies out there today.",71.6

"great game, i reccomend having patience if you are going to buy this game, a beautiful strategy game of what-if. for example, what if the great wall of china was made by america? (the great wall of america) well, thats possible! watch yourself holding history in your hands and bending it to your will! 10/10 great game! :d",228.7

"civ v is a great game. ive spent hours on end playing it. the other players are full of suprises though and they can betray you at any moment. *cough ghandi* however if you are not in to strategy type games then this is not for you but i do recommend giving it a go because i wasnt so sure about a type of game like this but now i love it! it is also for players of different types: -those who are out for blood can just murder everyone -those who like to be peaceful can just win the game with science or cultural there are so many ways to play this game! anyway i recommend it ive be dragging this on for to long. :p",37.8
"amazing game! definetly buy if you can, and every dlc they are all awesome. i think that civilization v + dlcs is better then the new civilization: beyond earth, and if the dlcs wont do it, try mods! als epic.",654.4

"i swear time ceases to exist as i play this game. whether you are crushing sparta with the legions of rome, or using the advanced technological knowledge of babylon to send a rocket in to space, you will love the epic that is civilization v.",245.1
"an absoloutly amazing game the only annoying thing is that a few days after i bought it steam had a 75% off sale which is frustrating but i cant do anything about it. i highly recommened this game 10/10",12.4

"one of my favorite franchises of all time, civ 5 has brought a lot of new and exciting content to the table, and a boat load of changes to boot. while some changes are better than others, the experience of building your nation, fighting for land, trading for resources, and the over all global experience is something great to be a part of. if you see that im online and not playing this game, assume ive been kidnapped and im trying to signal you.",59.9

"civilization v will be in my top 10 games of all time. i was hooked on this game within the first few turns that i took, easily losing nights to this game. espically with the great modding community, this game can be adjusted to anybodys liking, and would strongly recommend to those who enjoy strategy games and history, as i, am a history nerd and a strategy lover. watch your own civilization grow from one city, to the whole world, either by force or peaceful means, there are many decisions to be made when you play this game, and can be replayed over and over again.",590.4

"i have enjoyed the civilization series since the first game rolled out in the 1990s. although civilization iii and iv had some really great features, i do like the flexibility that civ v offers. the addition of religion as a victory standard is good. the traditional means of attaining victory are still there (cultural, science, conquest, diplomatic), so not much of a change there. i do like the hexigonal map base better than the squares of past civ installments., however, there are a few things that i do believe needs to be altered in the game. in civ iv, if your culture was dominant, it was possible to expand your borders through culture. this feature is missing. i would also like more freedom in using the spies, as was available in civ iv.",368.2

"another amazing entry to the 4x genre with civ v. prepare to burn many hours, turn after turn after turn, possibly declaring just one more turn. lots of changes to the series with an nice ui overhaul, improvements to combat and more. watch out for that crafty ghandi and his nukes.",45.6

"the gameplay stayed the same over the years but why change things if it works?. graphics got better, mechanics got finetuned, things added, things dropped. still a pleasant game for a lazy day at home. ...and no, i dont know either what happened to civ iv :p",80.9

"amasing strategie game really good deal especially on sale",156.2
"very well made turn based game. beware, very long games, not for an occasional casual player. found single player games fun for a while, but got extremly boring after a while. multiplayer on the other hand though, never gets old for me, adds a much more interesting game, after all, your dealing with real players. excellent to play with a friend[s].",286.3

"sid meiers civilization v also known as civ 5 was the first game that brought combat simulation and real world tactics toghether to create a seamless game where you can destory or protect both friends and foes. the dlc packs: gods & kings and brave new world are overpriced at $25 each however they did provide just enough content to satisfy me. i think because there is such an active community making new mods and maps this game will continue in the future with more dlc being released, fingers crossed it provides more bang for your buck. overall great game with awesome simulation and many factors within the gameplay. :) great game! 9/10",36.9

"this is quite a heavy game to get into! there are so many ways to play, to win, and to build your civilization that youll go crazy if you try to formulate a single way to win every game. i really love the hexagonal grid that this game uses; it really sets this turn-based strategy apart from others. the hexagonal grid allows for much more movement and mobility than square tiles.",543.7

"civilization v single-handedly drew me into the strategy game genre. the streamlined mechanics allows simplicity for a new player to pick up, but still retains depth for those looking to get more out of it. each playable civ is extraordinarily unique and the multiple paths towards victory increase replay value to a tremendous degree. this game is defintely worth purchasing, for history nerds like myself, strategy gamers, and just about anyone else (you cant go wrong with snagging this during the holiday sale). try it out!",143.1

"i know a lot of people compared civ v unfavorably to civ iv when civ v first came out. as a long (and i do mean long) time player of sid meier civilization games, i never understood that as i had a completely different impression. to me this is one of the best civ games since civ ii and alpha centauri. it was a return to some of the basics that made the game great with a number of tweaks (hexogonal grid, no unit stacking) that i feel improve it. add in the additional options in the wonderful expansions and you have, in my opinion, an all-time classic. i recommend this for everyone.",391.9
"the latest entry to the best turn-based strategy game series of all time, civilization v delivers the goods and implements new gameplay while still remaining true to the series. great game: 4.5/5",15.7

"simply amazing. for people new to civilization, this is a very intellectual and complex strategy game that never seems to get old. one playthrough is fairly short but i come back to it about once per month and play another. you can also customize the games so much that every time the game is a little bit different and i would challenge anyone to beat it on its hardest setting. for fans of the civ series, i believe they keep getting better. graphics improvements are great but i like the unit and tech changes, i would highly recommend it. also, the leader screens are a lot more involved and interesting. sadly they removed the city view but have the city change dynamically on the map. they also removed the throne room. not sure how i feel about those but at least they put spying and religion back in, in the expansions. definitely worth the money.",155.2
"i had played civilization iv and had loved it instantly. later, when civ v released, i used to dismiss it as hex tiles and stuff, until i played it with all expansions. its the best game from the series in my opinion. :)",79.8
"great game, always loved civ games. i was very glad to see civ5 beeing released on linux. it worked great for a few months, however recently the game started crashing while playing and that is a pitty. crashes are not very common maybe every 2 - 3 hours. neverless it would be great if it would not crash at all :)",402.8

"as a major supporter of turn based stategy games this has been one of my favorite series of games and sid meiers never never to impress. they are fun and very friend friendly for multiplayer gaming. its easy to get lost in the country that you built from the ground up and every game you learn something new. whether it be a useful game strategy, a famous quote, or some useful historical information from the civilopedia this game will always keep you interested.",164.7
"it a giant waste of time, literally. before you know it, its 5 am in the morning and still you need to do just one more turn.",272.6
"so this game needs to be reviewed as it is one of the greatested experiences ive ever had in gaming. this game is smooth and true to the franchise in every way. the dlcs add and change so much they almost feel like a whole new game. civ 5 brings to the table a fantastic turnbased experience that i can sit down and play for hours. trial and error, new straegies, different paths you can take will completely changed how the game will turn out. smart ai adds to the games sense of running a real country in a real world. the single player on its own makes this game great but like many other games nothing beats playing it with a friend. if you have the money i reomend picking this game up with all its dlc its well worth a look.",198.2

"this is an awesome strategy game. i havent played any earlier civ games so i cannot comment on how it compares, but it definitely ranks in my favourite strategy games.",39.7
"while not as good as the civ4 series the most recent patches released are getting it there. the hexagon tiles and one unit per tile seem to provide a better combat experience than that of civ4 but almost ever other victory conditions seems less so. i do recommend it based on its own merits alone. it is a fun game and if you like civ games you will like it civ5. however, if you are looking for another civ4 with better graphics this just isnt it ... yet. =)",675.2
"you cant get any better! i find that every time i play its a new experience, new tactics, new civs to hate on. if a game never gets old it should get an 11/10",283.8
"700 hours of gameplay and only now i thought of posting a comment. well... 1. never boring. 2. simple if you decide to macromanage; the most complicated game ever - in case you decide to control everything. 3. awesome soundtrack. 4. very detailed graphics. zoom in and you can see the grass grow. later in the game, build nuclear missiles and observe the mushroom cloud. death to your enemies! make sure you purchase the two dlc; the game by itself seems childs play. the dlc add new layers of complexity. its on sale often. last time i checked the complete edition (game + 2 dlc) was 10 euro.",724.8
"i recommend this game for those that like the turn based stratedy types. civ 5 gives you the right ammount of control over your civilisation without information overload. a well contructed game.",382.3
"spectacularly fun, ridiculously addicting - you should just get the brave new world expansion to start out with; the original and 1st expansion (gods and kings) still left the game a bit crippled with frustratingly random ai behavior, but the gameplay feels very solid and complete now. huge time sink :d",497.5
"one of my all time fav games, this requires you to have a stong economy while ballencing other aspects of your empire on multuple fronts. not only is this game diplomaticaly focoused it also has extreme focous for combat and war situations aswell. for example your units gain a bonous for attacking from a hill and can often not attack with indirect fire... if i had to make one complant i would say that some of the civs need a little re-ballancing other then that if you are a stratigist then you need to pick this game up 9.5/10",240.9
"where ghandi is a nuke-utilising tyrant, a 17th century ship of the line has a further viewing distance than a naval vessle of the 20th century, with its back-dated telescopes and even then, you can build a pyramid in the water. ill have you know that because of this, im sold. goty 1000/10 a++ *explosions*",223.8

"one more turn.... just one more... better than sex on drugs.",238.1
"this is by far one of the best turn based games ive played. whether its trying to get more delegates for the next world congress, warding npcs or other players off your borders, or fending off the all-too-many barbarians, theres always something to do, and it gets even better with friends.",131.4
"so much could be said for civ 5. including the expansion packs - gods & kings and brave new world - it is easily the best civ game ever made. every game is different and customizable to a great degree. multiplayer can be a joyous role-playing experience. the game allows for enough variation in decision-making that single player is just as fascinating. ive played all of the civ games going back to the first, and i cant imagine how amazing it would be to have civ 5 be the first one played. a proper review of this game would require 5,000 words. in short, it is a massive, and now polished, simulator combining the conventional history of humanitys story on planet earth with a solid gaming experience. anyone who is interested in strategy games has to play this.",430.6
"great 4x timesink. easy to get into with plenty of depth for when you get better. so-so multiplayer, as with all civilization titles. ai can be lacking but its competent on higher difficulties with bonuses. both expansions are totally worth it.",673.1

"civ has got to be one of the best strategy games ive ever tried. turn-based and played on a hexagonal field, a bit like a board game, but the special rules in civ make you think twice before doing anything. one part of the game that i love is how you get to control every little aspect of your civ; from research and military, to social policies (communism!) and construction. another great thing is that there is a big selection of different civs, each with their own unique units and/or buildings and traits, from across time to choose from; such as 18th century america, 1st century rome, 9th century denmark, and many more, with another chunk being added with the gods and kings expac, such as 17th century sweden. also has a f*cking great soundtrack. my conclusion: if you are into other turn-based strategy games, such as total war, but want en exciting twist, try civilization 5.",189.8
"shadow of the great earlier civs, in particular civ 4.",829.9
"a very simplistic sequel to the civilization series, but thats not a bad thing. the game is gorgeous and although a lot of the micromanagement between your cities has been removed, combat is a much more enjoyable experience with a hex-based grid and the inability to stack units. ive yet to play brave new world, but gods and kings is a very worthwhile addition to the game, as well.",158.7

"as a person who hasnt played a previous installment of civilization, i found it very easy to learn the systems and gameplay and was easily able to have fun with no frustration to what i originally thought to be an overly complex game. while there is certainly complexities for long-time civ fans, it is very easy to pick up and play as a beginner 5/5 the nuances of this game make it a challenge for veterans of the series and simple/fun enough for beginners to play on lower difficulties.",89.5

"some would argue that civ v dumbed things down from civ iv. i would argue the opposite - iv had overcomplicated the genre, and i think v has brought back the accessibility of the franchise, whilst stepping up the graphics and ai. one of my favourite games.",757.1
"with the 2 major expansions civ v has risen its complexity to finally stand up to civ iv with its rich gameplay. and since brave new world was patched to fix the balance of world congress diplomacy, culture influence and turism, the fans can at last consider picking civ v as their favorite civilization game of all time. its so good in fact, that despite over 650 hours of playing, it continues to give me a bad case of the just 1 more turn syndrome. dont come close to this game if you still want to have a life.",795.1
"this game is probably the best timesink ive ever encountered. i play it with a friend almost once or twice a week for hours on end, and it really doesnt get boring.",325.8
"with way more than 200 hours of gameplay (steam is always about 40% of what i actually played), this is my most played game in my library. this is not the greatest game of all time, but it is probably in my top three, with portal 2 as the greatest game of all time. while this game does take long, it is worth it and very consuming! i love this game and i would most definitely recommend it! i love this game!",231.5
"took over rome and called gandhi a  all in one turn. 10/10",13.2
"fun game to play alone or with friends. few improvements needed for the ai when playing against computers but still, i played many exciting hours. multiplayer is a bit tricky as one game can last many/many/many hours. all players have to be available at the same time. i recommand this game. you can start playing alone but then play with friends and your alliance will give the game a new dimension.",477.0
"a turn based strategy game, civilization v continues the classic civilization series.",43.0
"do you think you sleep too much? do you have too much spare time? worry no more - the nevest civ is here! get started, and after you have played one more turn... ...your alarm reminds you that 18 hours have passed and its time to get to school again. great game!",267.7
"amazing turn based strategy game. great for experienced and new comers alike, the tutorial modes go from a simple one that gives you the basics while playing (great for experienced strat players), to more in depth guides. with amazing graphics and music, as well as tons of dlc and community mods, you will get loads of gameplay time out of this game. i suggest the goty addition which includes all but the 2 most recent dlcs for only 20$ more.",351.7
"civilization v is one of the best pc games i can suggest to anyone who asks! its a massive time consumer but its deffinetly worth it! i personly own all the dlcs which t received after purchasing the complete edition, and it just creates a whole new gaming experience! so buy this game,i urge you! you will not regret it! 5*s 10/10",120.4
"this game is great fun. if you like strategy games that are also fun to play with friends this is your game. however, vanilla civilization v is terrible, no strategy just war forget everything else. so if you do buy make sure you also get the brave new world dlc too. (it adds trade routes, world congress, spying, religion, other improvements and much needed additional civilizations to play as) otherwise vanilla will just get repetetive and boring really quick. hope this helps i love civ v so if you have questions just ask.",521.4
"i like it but every time i play, i just wants me to play age of empires more.",86.3
"nice in-deph turn based stratey game only a few texture bugs here and there but it doesnt affect gameplay high recommended",37.9
"be prepared for the game that can take anywhere from 1 hour to about 40 hours. this game has many aspects to it that make it fantastic, and even better with brave new world dlc, like trade routes, tourism, or religion. each civ has a different playstyle, and this grants for a new, refreshing experience every time you play.",131.9
"civ v is on of those games that you have heard great things about, but arent sure if youll like it. you buy it when its on sale and then immediatley lose your entire day playing it, strategizing on when you should declare war or who should be your ally. it does have some minor flaws but the fun you have both by yourself or with friends outsizes the few flaws i found.",319.7
"im new to turn-based strategy games, and i really love this. granted, i mostly play against the ai, but it can still be very challenging. i like that i dont need to form a group before deciding to play. and when i do play with friends, its a fun race to see what will happen.",444.8

"if you own the expansions (g&k and bnw), then this is one of the best and most accessible 4x games ever created. its lacking a certain something by itself, but the expansions on top make this a fantastic purchase that just takes massive bites out of you free time. without expansions: this is a great game to buy while on sale. with expansions: worth all of your time and money.",41.1
"i have to say, after starting this game up i did not really understand very much. but anyone who loves strategy games like myself will thoroughly enjoy it. there are multiple ways to win, and a multitude of units to choose from. advance far enough, and you can even build tanks and shoot yourself off into space to win!",191.3
"great game cool factions. but it needs canada. canada has had a huge history and if the states made it so should canada",215.3
"with the brave new world expansion this game is a turn based strategy dream. ive been playing civ games from the mid 90s, starting with civilization 2. i love the many paths to victory in this game. you can crush enemies with military force. invest heavily in science to be the first to reach an alien world. you can win a cultural victory by just being a really awesome country, or with diplomacy by making enough friends.",93.6
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played in my life. i put more than 150 hours into this game and the only other game i put more than one hundred hours into is skyrim, and thats sayig something about this game. this game is easily around a 9/10 or 8/10 you will be so addicted",325.6
"get yourself some hot coffee and clear your mind. youll engage in many manly businesses if you ever decide to open this game. time consuming and lots of ways and strategies to win. but one thing will remain throughout your 100h+ career in civ5. fun and individuality as nothing will remain the same in all your games. except ghandi. damn you, ghandi. protect your settler. please protect them.",322.1

"quite enjoyable if you like turn-based strategic gameplay",204.2
"my review of civ v: this game is amazing!! basically what you do is: grow your empire, make friends with other empires. and when the time comes, you could fight with all the opposing empires once you have built your army. it was surprising how each country had different looking military, this game is unique and fun! definitely recommend worth your $30, go check it out its awesome and epic and is the best strategy game ive ever come across in my life. not even exaggerating, this game is so beautiful and just epic go for it",36.2
"kind of slow to get into but once you start a game with a few friends, its very hard to get out of xd i highly recommend this game!",35.9
"not my favorite turn-based strategy game, it was worth playing a few times, never really saw what all the hype was all about for this game, commanding forces, building structures, its not my cup of tea...",1.5
"best pc exclusive out right now. i recommend this game for everyone, and anyone who gets it should definetly play multiplayer with me. just watch out for the wrath of khan.",84.9
"great game, i would reccommend everyone gives it a try",36.2
"man what an awesome time waster this game is. civilization is one game that will always have a place in my heart, but honesetly nothing has changed dramatically from #1 to this, apart from things like 1 unit per tile, and hexagonal tiles. you still explore, settle, battle, research, strike flaky treaties only to have them broken when you refuse stupid demands, get into century long military stalemates, etc .. its like the malibu stacy with a new dress. simpsons fans will get it.",5.0
"look, ive played this series since civilization ii back in the day of pixel sprites and beatles music. civ v, the latest installment is great. the base game is sort of lackluster compared to the complexities of civ iv, but gandk and bnw (the expansions) help to flesh out the gameplay and give it that true civ feel. do i recommend? yes, i do. a/5.",389.9
"i will admit this game tested all of my skills as an effective leader and the experience will be daunting for most new players but with some practice (maybe solo games at most) the basic concept and structre of the game will become apparent and easy to master creating an unmatched rts experience. this game recieves the generals recommendation",12.7
"to me? this game is fun. i can go for hours on end sometimes playin this game. not the best at it but there are so many options and goals. there are like 5 ways you can win for s sake. you can spread religion, gain culture science and a bunch of other . its ing awesome! especially with the workshop it has huuuuge potential. only beat 1 game in 20 hours but its definitly a great time consumer were u to play on your plane flight. i will never do online as that  would take days but still. good game if you like long matches with tons of options. probably the most changable game with workshop on steam!",82.5

(war or peace, you decide.) this game is has a random gameplay each save you make. one amazing game, something that couldnt be beaten in a long, long time...",30.7
"you know what? if youre bored and want to hold your  and balls for a while as you just click around and take over cities? then this is the game for you. i value the game at 19.99$",266.4
"i play this game maybe once every three months when my friend convinces me after hours of begging to start a game with him. i have never in my life actually completed a full game of civ v, and i will never in my life play this game by myself. i mean its fun for what it is, but its not fun enough for me to sink more than an hour in without getting bored out of my mind.",18.9

"i can lose entire weekends in this game. its a must have.",387.6
"best rts ever made, and in my personal top 10 games of all time. in civ 5, you assume the role of a past great leader, like washington, ghandi, queen elizabeth and so on. you rule and control their respective countries build your own empire. you do so by raging war, or making peace with others. i highly recommend buying at least the two major expansions. (gods & kings, and brave new world). theyre huge really game changing expansions. like adding religion to the game, which could mean the difference between friendship or nuclear war. as far as time goes, you start in the year 4000 bc (by default). and progress your empire through the ages all the way into the future. even though beyond earth (next entry in civ) is already on the horizon, civ 5 is a true masterpiece. buy this game now.",102.2

"time flies as one heads up one great civilization after another. for an old-school civ-player, all this religion and diplomacy malarkey can get a bit hectic and feels a bit foreign at first, but it definitively adds to the atmosphere of the game. it is a well-balanced turn-based strategy game with an incredible amount of content. i have only managed to win at king once and it took some thinking in the end-game. success is not always guaranteed, but a few setbacks along the way arent necessarily fatal. recommended for anyone with a fair bit of spare time on their hands. its addictive nature rarely allows for just a quick five minutes... type of play, but that is part of its timeless charm.",154.5
"want to get nuked by ghandi? then this is the game for you!",89.0

"definitely a must buy as it really worth the price you pay for. a game that uses strategy and planing in order to conquer or achieve a certain objective. isnt it everyone dream to take over the world or being the leader of an advance nation? well at least for me :). if single player is just not your thing, get a bunch of friends and start teaming up or backstabbing them in the back to gain control in multiplayer :) do remember is just a game though dont get serious when one bite your back haha. great game, for those who enjoy turn base and strategy game :) . it so interesting till you dont realize you have played it for hours haha",119.8

"wow bought this a few days ago not expecting them to put this as a marquee sale but nonetheless it was worth the moeny for this and all of the extra content. this is an amazing game, veterans may think its dumbed down but in truth, 4 needed a cutting of the fat, this streamlined the gameplay to a point of a very well balanced game that is not only fun to play in, but challenging still. this game is amazing and you should buy it while its this cheap. do yourself the favor!",31.4

"civilization v is the epitome of the civ series. i know many civ fans would say they think iv edges it out, but the additions in v combined with the faithful execution of the core civ formula puts this one on top. hex-based tiles make it all the more awesome, and the elimination of doomstacks with the one unit per tile limit makes the game much more tolerable and strategic in many ways. with the expansions, there is a whole lot of content to see, and the best part of the game is arguably whats great about every civ game: flexibility to play the way you want to play. different victory types will keep you interested for mulitple playthroughs, and, like all civ games, you will find yourself laughing when you find your civilization on the brink of destruction at the hand of ghandis army. just be warned: the zulunation probably hates you.",72.8
"this game is a total time suck. and i mean that in a good way. when i start playing, i want to keep playing for hours on end. i find it very hard to turn off in the middle of a game and save it for later. i need to see what will happen on the next turn, and the next, and the next... the different scenarios keep things fresh. my favorite is the steampunk scenario in the gods & kings expansion.",27.4
"base game has large amount of content and is very good. brave new world dlc added new breath of life into a game that was staring to get a bit boring, would reccomend buying after getting a feel for the game.",102.7
"so much fun and can easily waste the whole day on this game. easy for anyone to pick up since the game does a good job of explaining things to you with the advisors and civilopedia. i didnt play the vanilla version but i heard gk & bnw helped make the game a lot better.",36.0
"highly recommend this game great to play with friends after getting all the main dlcs as the base game is not so great. however you need lots of free time to complete games.",153.6

"brilliant game if you can pick up both expansions and all dlc in one go. if you cant the vanilla game is good and all, but lacks alot of (whats the word) finish, both the expansions eventually bring it. a few draw backs for myself are, the one unit to a hex (i enjoyed civ 4 alot before this), this can make huge armies rathe unmanageable. i feel like there isnt enough tech, would love for it to go on further, into future techs in beyond earth in some way. some of the great things with this game is it has a huge modding community, massive multiplayer base, and the devs are still looking after the game.",215.0

"a friend had told me about civilization for a while now, and i finally decided to pick it up during the summer sale. glad i did! civ is an awesome game so far and i literally instantly got hooked on it the first time i played. multiplayer is amazing so far even with just playing with one friend. awesome game!",140.6
"vanilla is adequate. gods & kings is useless (included in bnw). brave new world is great. the mods, however, define the reason why i love this game. pro - purchase it and see how quickly 5:30pm turns into 4:45am. con - purchase it and see how quickly 5:30pm turns into 4:45am. con - mods disable achievements (understandable).",528.8
"love the versatility and unique play styles of each leader and love the ability to play with my friends online and the drop in drop out is wonderful",116.4

"one of the best games i have ever played. the replay value is what makes this game worth while. the game changes through every playthrough because you can make 1000 different decissions between each era leading to different endings. one game being the world leader peacfully desiding to host the world games, the next game you could be a war mongering leader that rules a majority of the world.",943.3

"every want to take over half a continent, or name all your cities tick? in this game you can, as you strategise on the plan for your civilization, wether it is building the notre dame or conquering every civilization in sight. it is rather hard to finish a game, one game can last for hours. i rate this 8 curries out of 10 curries",71.6
"this is the best strategy game i have ever played. there are so many things going on at once, you really fell involved with the short clips and battles. its almost impossible to play the same game twice.",68.7
"i was one of the first to buy this game in 2010, and i was also one of the first to stop playing this because i, like many others, felt it was a watered down version of civ iv. however, with the two expansion packs that seem lovingly crafted by firaxis, the game is easily one of my favorite 4x and strategy games of all time. the end-game was brought to life by bnw, and g&k fixed all the ai concerns i had. if you like strategy games at all, buy this game.",60.6

"truth be told, i had no idea what this game was until my firend showed it to me one day, and i liked it ever since then. the total freedom you get with this game is, well not as much as say, minecraft, garrys mod, or spore... but it has alot of freedom consitering of its genera of interphace glory. brave new world just adds frosting to the cake, with new game mechanics and an utter overhall of the cultural and rework of the diplomatic victories, which were way too easy in vanilla and g&k (diplomatic is still easy) but it takes planing for the long hall... if you dont need the great wall... then dont build it you have bigger fish to fry! overall, this game is great, cant wait for beyond earth! also called nuke simulator v",854.7
"awesome game. visually beautiful, strategically deep, historically informative, and leads to great stories. the day i bought this, i sat down to learn how to play it after hearing for years how great the civilization series is. when i saved and exited, steam informed me i had 12 hours logged. i paid full price of $30 (1/21/14) and its worth it so far and i suspect will continue to be.",106.1

"this game is awesome. i love how it takes time to build up, and you can go from the primted, to the very advanced. the only thing i see weird in it, is when the ai leaders denouce you for no reason when your already friendly with them, besides that i think the game is perfect. heres a tip, when playing on two player, make sure you have your food right next to you eatting it all day because thats how long the game takes to finsh. i love and you will to.",99.8
"now im not saying its a bad game, but you better have nothing else to do for the entire day because this game takes forever to finish a match. but if your playing single player, you could obviously save the game and continue it later, in multiplayer its really hard to finish a complete match. but if you just want to pass some time then buy it",102.9

"not a good game if you played previous civs. features were taken out and lazily implemented in expansion pack leading to a very lackluster experience. conquest seems to be the only way to win in this game because ai is . decent for a first timer but civ 4 is better.",41.9

"my 100 hours cannot even explain how amazing this game is. if you love expanding, creating militaries, and ruling the world, then this is your game. i love the dynamic relationship process, it works almost like real life. the system can teach you how real world politics can work sometimes, and no world is ever the same.",158.8
"very addicting, be prepared to sink a hundred hours, that you didnt mean to, into this game.",213.7
"back in 1991, a little game called civilization was released. it was a pretty awesome game, everything was perfect. except for gandhi. gandhi was given the lowest possible rating for aggression, he wouldnt hurt a fly. however, when a civilization adopted democracy, it would set back all other civs aggression levels by 2. this meant gandhi was set to -1, which flung him all the way back to the highest rating - 255. its been a running joke ever since. since then gandhi has conquered many civs taken over many planets and made many nukes. #neverforget.",75.7
"this is pretty much the only 4x game i can truly get in to. i have never played a more immersive and rewarding strategy/simulation game before this. only one quibble, though. why do barbarian tribes still spawn in the 1800s and up?!",30.8
"a great game with enough of a mix of classic mechanics and new ones to keep the series fresh. the new combat mechanics are a great improvement over the stack of death from previous games and i still love the national borders. i dont like the fact that you have to buy expansions to get some of the older series staples like culture victories. still definitely a buy in my opinion. just one more turn lol.",152.7

"great single player game, or multiplayer game! with multiple choices on characters, packed with loads to discover and enjoy. the turn based gameplay is a little hard to get used to, but once you do it comes naturally. weather youre a lone player or someone who plays together with friends, this game is great for you! 10-10",27.6

"they make it easy to mod the game with built in search tools to browse mods guess that is why i have 600+ hours logged in... 750 hours and counting and with the expansions it is like a whole new game",789.7

"if you want to chill and play with friends after a man plays chess with you at the same time then this is the game! i would say that civ 3 is probably superior in most aspects, however this game i find encaptivating which leads me to spend many hours on it at a time!",17.9

"awesome game with the dlc but the standard version is missing a lot of stuff from older civs. buy in bundle if price is reduced, but not only main game.",120.1
"very addicting game. really intense and i reccomend people buying this game!",81.3
"great game, but i advise you to get it with the dlc because it adds some pretty core features that should really have been in the vanilla game anyway. im talking about gods and kings, and brave new world.",236.6

"it is a fun game . . . but only with both expansions.",368.1
"i enjoy playing this game because i like the idea of being able to develop technologies and advance through the eras. i also enjoy attacking enemy units but find it annoying when i usually lose the battles even with the advantage. overall, i think that it is a pretty good turn based strategy game.",356.1
"wow - what a fun game - the replayability is great. im well over 200 hours on this one and its new every time. keep the expansion packs going..",788.2
"play this game if you like micromanaging numbers and the feeling of success when your numbers are higher than your opponents. the only non-numbers thing is positioning (of cities and units). and i suppose diplomacy. the gameplay is very good though. it has a moderately steep learning curve, but once you understand the mechanics and learn the costs of everything you will start to think more strategically and thats when it becomes fun.",45.6
"when civ 5 came out, i didnt like it at all. i still wouldnt like it, if not for the exceptional expansions that address pretty much every flaw (except the ai, which i still find a bit silly, but i find almost all ai flawed) its friendly and fair to the new civ players, and has enough content to keep the veterans occupied. i especially loved the scenarios.",80.8
"let me spin a tale of truth and sorrow....you know all these nations, some of which you previouly admired? well  that. you will unleash the fury of your inner demons upon various pixels after watching them *attempt* to fight back. long story short: get the game.",181.7
"civ 5 is an amazing game, once you start a game you will want to finish. i started as britain and over a few thousand years i had managed to be hated by the whole world, this is when i decided to strike. i started with india demolishing there country and army with my huge force of advanced soldiers, war in civ is quite tactical and requires planning; i started by surrounding the border with my army and naval force and then when my army is together i launch the attack and overwhelm the opponents army. i conquer india and proceed onto more countries. i managed to destroy every country in the world except america and ethiopia when i decided i had spent way too long on the game! :d 9.5/10",112.3

"this is by far my most favorite strategy game! there are many other games that are pretty close to this such as total war rome, and so forth but where this game realy shines is the chronology. the fact that i can start with pretty much any civilization during the ancient period and take them into the future is amazing! not only that but each and every civilization has their own advantages such as japan of course having superior airforce, with rome having faster growth, etc. but none of them too overpowering. in the end there are so many aspects to this game that i truly love and would reccomened this game to anyone even if this is your first time trying out strategic games.",65.7

"civilization 5. pretty damn good if youre into turn based strategy games. the game unfortunatly requires some dlc to get the full experience. if you finish a game youll probably realize how deep this game goes. there is multiple ways to play and this creates a replayable heaven.",824.7
"civilization v- the only place where genghis kahn is a peace-lover and mohandas gandhi is a war-monger. sums it up pretty well really, anything is possible here. i said to myself i will do homework today to keep on top of things. yep that didnt exactly happen... went on it about 11am, looked up at the clock and it was half 6 in the evening. oops! in all seriousness, one of the best strategy games ever made.",26.1
"civilization v is a very fun strategy game. you choose a country which you are the great leader of such as george washington for u.s.a, and elizabeth for england. you try to build a strong civilization. you can win five different ways: using diplomacy, using millitary, using science, using culture, or just having your civilization have the highest score by 2050.",50.8

"played a game where everyone was ghandi, a nuclear holocaust insued. 10/10",80.6
"certainly one the best strategy games created..... this many years in the industry, the civilization series have all been top notch games for any strategist and thinker...... the expansion of the micro management of cities and civilizations, such as culture, science, happiness and the like all add more depth to an all ready rock steady franchise. tip of the hat to those who kept the series alive and innovative",160.1
"great turn based game taking the time to invest into it, and checking out the comminuty workshop etc makes this a game you should play seriously atleast once then all the fun can happen afterwards great single player, with or without add ons and additions, multiplayer can be fun but prepare to spend alot of time playing it, especially if you choose a slow game pace with 8 players...could be loading and saving the game for months great game though",255.7

"this game is such a great game. in fact, i hate almost every rts and this is the only one i actually like. its not the hardest to know what to do, but also requires skill. especially when playing on the harder difficulties. this game is more of a political game, being that you get to start up you civilization with one city and continue to grow it until its an entire country. most problems with the game are solved within the brave new world expansion. if you enjoy rtss or would like to conquer other countries with giant death robots then this is a game for you.",119.5

"i like the game ,because it have so many civilizations!!!!!!",136.6
"have sank many hours into this game - a rich world and complex strategy game. flaws: multiple playthroughs can be repetitive. ai civilizations are often unpredictable, often declaring war on yours for no tangible reason, despite previous cooperation. i am told that the dlc packs go some way to fixing this.",208.1
"honestly the greatest steam game ive played to date. i highly recommend. 10/10",464.4
"amazing game, really pulls you in once you get the basics. a lot of variation and endless fun with your friends. definitely a must have.",171.4
"excellent strategy game that you can get lost in for hours. disapointed in the fact that nearly all the multiplayer servers all require you to have the dlc brave new world ( a ripoff in price). other then that good game.",42.4
"this game is great really recomend it but it is a game where its alot more fun to play with friends rather than by yourself.",271.9
"too hard to understand, i hate it....! how can i get my money back! -that is what i used to say to this game. i completely change my mind this game is endless fun!",55.7
"multiplayer is a bit buggy but it is still a brilliant game. especially in this sale, the full version for 9 is incredibly cheap",76.6
"as a single player game: magnificent and flawless but multiplayer experience is horrendous. disconnections start after 20-30 turns, especially youre playing with more than 4-5 people. sometimes nothing happens, then suddenly game goes boom, and when you try reloading your latest save, half of the players cant even join to the lobby. it was a real ordeal on my part. stay away from multiplayer tab unless all players have top-notch crystal-clean connections.",139.5
"this game is pretty damn fun. theres endless possibilities and will not get boring.",104.0
"simply, there are better games out there. the fact that metacritic believes it to be the greatest strategy game of all time is insulting. the ai are bad, the multiplayer is broken, and frankly i just find there to be a lack of content. a big company releasing so little, you really get the impression they are money grabbing. by far, paradox interactive are my favourite game devs. their games deserve the title of greatest strategy. if you are easily satisfied then get this game. if you are mature and enjoy a challenge with many times more indepth content, then get eu4, ck2 or hoi3. thats what i think.",25.9
"civ 5 is definitely the best one to come out so far. the graphics and the gameplay are awesome! i have pretty much all the dlc and both expansion packs, which really add amazing depth to the game. i started with just the basic game at first though, and instantly i was hooked and have been ever since. i love this game! but dont listen to me, i am but a humble servant...",140.1
"i ruled the world as a fascist germany and steam rolled england, russia, and america with nukes and giant death robots. 8/10",56.3
"great game, but you really need both expansions to get the real deal",91.3
"very very good, however i do have some crashes but overall this game is epic",39.4
"sunk nearly 600 hours into this game, still find it deep and rewarding, best current 4x game on the market 10/10, concentrates on civilization building, not just warfare.",617.7
"this is a game that is easy to come back to on those quiet nights. every play through is different because of all the combinations of ways to win. this is especially fun in multiplayer but turns can start to take a really long time as the game progresses.",143.7
"do you like turn based strategy games? have you ever wondered what it would be like to play against ghandi (he will nuke your cities). do you love hexagon based movements? do you love expensive dlc? if you answered yes to any of these questions. buy this game when its on sale. which is all the time",107.5
"you will spent your all time for playing this game.",10.3
"best sid meiers game by far it is a very fun game and u dont finish games to fast but it dosent take to long",48.0
"ive played a little bit of the game and get what the game is about. with the time ive played ive experienced victory and total defeat. the game has great features and awesome gameplay, but with only one downside. if you some much as  off another civ a little bit. they will want nothing more but to kill you and turn your allies against you. but that kinda just adds to the gameplay i suppose. but this game is great to play with friends, you can team up and take out everyone else, or be that one  and be all warlord like ( totally me ). but overall it is a great game, and even better with friends. hope this review helped in some way.",43.4
"the fluidity and addictive nature of this game really made me feel comfortable as a first time strategy game player. a must buy. unless you value your social life.",178.7
"love it! really great game. i recomment it to anyone who likes strategie games.",44.2
"excellent quality. binds all of the qualities a turn based strategy should have and near perfects them. fun to play, at times a bit slow but enjoyable regardless. riddled with some questionable design choices it is sometimes frustrating to play. all around a truly high quality game. rating: 96%",342.2
"great game, highly addictive, strategical and competitive. the obly con are the laoding screens= too long :/ overall one of my best games i own :)",92.5
"this game is simply amazing. i nuke all the other countries. starting with ghandi.",224.0
"this game is like viagara,serioulsy,this game is so addictive that my balls sweat everytime i play it because i dont shower in a week. the game is like the ultimate fantasy(gandhi nuking the aztecs or washington bombing the mongols.). play this game now",154.3
"a video-game boardgame that accurately pays homage to and makes fun of real-life cultures by quite nearly replicating some of the most believeable and unbelieveable events of human history. cautionary for the impatient, this game takes a long time to play!",45.9
"oh my god this game is so addiciting if you love rts, if you dont you will still freaking love it!",80.7
"with the new gods and kings expac, this game is taken from a mediocre entry into the hallowed series to a game worthy of being a civ game.",309.5
"it was a interesting and creative game. it had limited resources that made it more of a challenge but gives you a reason to expand to other regions. the idea and story behind the game is truely a recipe for fun and creativity. i have payed these games before on other systems and inever get tired of all the things i can complete and do on civilization.",3.6
"i absolutely love this game before getting the game i desired to get this game and it delivered on what i was desiring. thank you!",352.2
"notice how all reviewers have 100+ hours into the game. i think that explains how good the game is.",390.9
"highly recommended if you dont want to go outside ever again",138.3
"a good civilization game, im glad with what theyve added to this part of the series and how they fixed other things with dlc. not much to say extra about it, if you liked civ 4 youll probably like civ 5.",26.4
"amazingly good strategy game. if ure looking for great turn-based strategy game u dont have to search any longer! this is the masterpiece of strategy games, and with its 2 big dlcs its even better than just the base game. if i only had more time to play it ... it would be a great game if youre in prison, ud have a lot of time to improve your strategy. score 10/10!",4.8
"its awesome but takes a loooong time and when i finaly got to a gun i crashed d: although i recommend it!",36.9
"infact one of my favorite games, this game lets you customize your own empire through power or diplomancy. even science and culture. however without the gods and kings and brave new world expansions (also babylon) the game gets boring. however with the 2 expansions the game is a masterpeice. civ5 vanilla: 5/10 civ5 expansions: 10/10 (also buy complete instead of paying for dlcs later, 50$ for complete yet around 100$ for all the dlc sepreatly)",475.7
"one of the best strategy games out there. the dlcs are pricey, but 35 for the base game + all dlc is a good deal in my opinion. would definitley recommend this to anyone looking for a fun strategy game! :)",74.7
"the only civilization game ive played before i played civilization v was civ.exe aka civilization. like, the first one. that is how old school i am. but enough about me, this is about civilization v. the first thing that hit me about civilization v (after figuring out how to prevent it from crashing during the intro video, that is) was how crappy the graphics are. everything is like little men and cities and vehicles that stuff. thats disgusting. civilization had little squares for everything (except planes - they were circles). cities were squares, men were squares, tanks, boats, catapults, missiles. everything was squares and that is how it should be. but its ok because civilization v has this strategic view that makes everything squares like they should be. once i found that setting i was able to enjoy the rest of this games bugs in style.",292.2
"quite enjoyable if you like turn-based strategic gameplay",204.2
"havent played it much, i need brac  dlc to play with nick and collins... what the  i buy the game 5 dollars 6 years ago dont know hwo to play why did i eeven install it? 14/14 - its alright",15.3
"you create growing empire at the dawn of human history that actually progresses through time advancing/evolving technologically over time as you create your own version of human history. who could ask for a better rpg world warfare game?",32.2
"it gives you a reason to stay up until 3 every night, even when you dont want to or really shouldnt. it just does through pure unadulterated substance. 10/10 will play every day for the rest of my life.",92.6
"this is a awesome game it takes me back to the times i was playing command and conqure for the ps1 and ps2 it truly is a amazine game i recomend you buying it. it is very cheap for what you get and i almost forgot its on pc so you can easly mod it there are also some great mods out there one of my best mods are the world war 2 remake mods it is a fantastic mod and you can choose to be any country form britain, france, germany,usa,ussr it is a classic mod and i hope the guy or girl makes another! this is my post on this game thanks for reading! btw check out my youtube channel i am starting to make some videos on this game i just need to find the right capture software!",14.1
"one of the best strategy games to this date (even compared to rts genre). dating from the first original civ i this is the game that i always played and consume much of my times. some of the critics to the game is the insane cpu requirements for this game because previous installment of civ always light on cpu and graphic resources, and the exclusion of features like religion and extended diplomat system in the vanilla version (availabe but requires g & k or brave new worlds dlc while previous civ game it is included in base game).",250.0
"i keep coming back to it, and it always sucks me in for hours.",120.8
"probably the greatest turn based strategy game ive played to date. with all the different victory conditions, map layouts, and leaders, its like playing a different game each time. the games do take a long time though, especially playing with others, be prepared to sit down for 6 hours and play. or you can do pitboss games and the game also alows you to safe it and pick it up later.",137.4
"its hard not to enjoy the civilization games, and this is so far my favorite. the expansions make it even better.",330.1
"one of the best games that will consume hours and make you hate your best friends!",203.6
"this game will take away all of your time. not spare time, all of your time.",658.6
"fun time burning game :) awesome to play with friends.",306.1
"very good, top end turn based stratagy! 85/100 graphics 70/100 sound 90/100 gameplay 60/100 replay 30/100 customization dont expect customization to be high in a game like this, although for this game it doesnt really matter, good game great to play with friends can get repatitious/ boreing after a while.",19.3
"this game is a great statergy game. it is hard to pick up, it will take practice but once you know how to play youll be able to play. i highly recommend this game",14.6
"if you enjoy air, you will love this game!!!(go ahead try not breathing....)",348.4
"a great game that quickly sucks up hours of your life, the civ series never fails to disapoint.",106.1
"best strategy game ive ever played, its silly how addicting this game is. once you start a game and you get into it - you instantly forget about time.",105.2
"as a bad rts player, i recommend civilization as it is turn-based ;). anyway, the nation you guide in the game, organized in cities, has a very deep but easily approachable management system, and advancing through the game is very satisfactory.",34.9
"amazing and fun strategy game! only the best can win it all!",39.2
"a very good turn based stategy game with a very good combat system and numerous ways to win. the choice of civilisations is also very good, each being specialised in their own way, be it for a domination victory or a cultural one. there is however one big issue with the game that i find really annoying; the automatic camera. the camera will jump to the next unit that needs orders, this can be sometimes be good, however it jumps to units all over the map, rather than the closest ones. overall it is a good game and i reccomend that you get it.",391.7
"great game, in my opinion. ive spent quite a few hours playing it, and i can say one thing for sure: you need the dlc to get the full experience. great game though.",216.2
"great replay value, although you unfortunatley will not be able to replay it since you will die of old age during your first game 10/10",113.6
"i love this game! its easy to approach but hard to master, its thematic, the replayability is great as you branching paths and policy trees can be varied from the very start. striving to get the best, most successful historical civilization is truly addictive!",111.7
"so much fun! such long games ... cant.stop.playing",92.7
"civ v games take a long time and are very addicting but challenge your strategic ability and put you in the throne of a nation. highly recommended.",19.1
"probably my favorite game to play at the moment. i love it even though i hardly ever decide to finish old games. way more fun to start new ones!",70.5
"a good game alone, even better with a few friends. only wish we could have mods in the multiplayer.",220.8
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played and it keeps getting better with each expansion. the complete edition is very much worth picking up, too - very few of the dlcs arent worth going through.",67.3
"another great installment in this classic franchise.",412.4
"it really doesnt get better than this for a civilization management game. with the two expansions you have unlimited options for play style. ive easily sunk more than 600 hours into this game and i keep coming back. tons of mods in workshop also help keep things fresh as well and the community support is unlike any other game out there. i cant recommend this enough. look out for fredrich the great. he lies.",725.9
"a game you can play and literally lose days at a time, then after 20 or so hours of gameplay and lose so its all been for nothing! fantastic game, if i ever get bored or have spare time on my hands, throw it on and watch the day disappear. easy enough to pick up as well, cant wait for next expansion..",81.2
"i was playing this game and then i realized that i had been playing for 120 hours straight and got off",121.6
"this is a vast improvement over the previous titles, and keeps you entertained for hours.",30.8
"lots of fun, highly recommended to anyone with a bit of patience and a willingness to figure stuff out :)",93.4
"really? youre wasting you time reading user reviews when you could be playing civ v right now? seriously, buy it.",52.9
"very good game, a big improvement over the first game in my opinion.",14.7
"one... more... turn... i cant tell you how many times i have said those three words while playing this game. if you love strategy, history, alternate history, or just having a good multiplayer match with friends, get this game. where else will you become peacekeepers with genghis khan and atilla? where else will you team up to defeat the evil, warmongering, nuclear menace that is gandhis india? where else will you find mods that allow you to play as the daleks, arstotzka or even equestria? no where! so get the game already! (dont forget all of the dlc!) 10/10",245.3
"this game is so amazing i can not fully begin to tell you how fun and extraordinary this game is!!! this game has always been my favorite game and i cant wait to see what this game will bring next!",192.7
"civ 5 is one of the most addictive games on the market. its replayability is near infinate, and that is only increased by the ease of playing online with other steam members (way easier that the past attempts at multiplayer).",135.8
"i love this game by far the best game you can get for wartime fun. the strategy that goes into building your empire up and making everyone happy and fat with food. after you build it up i normaly shot for a fight to death to see who wins and its epic the way you feel after beating the  out of your bff in multi player.",538.6
"building on the originals its a very time consuming game. but very enjoyable.",126.9

"great game, would definitely recommend it. only downfall is that it is waaaay too addictive.",206.0
"sid meiers first creation - railroda tycoon on the pc. it was a great game and that was back in the early 1990s. things have come along since then and this still represents a great gamge from a great name and a great house.",510.1
"this game annoy me just gut ask by rome if i could help them kill germans and i say oki but he had to wait 10 rounds so i could be ready they 10 rounds pass and im haf way down to germany and then rome decleare war agianst me insted of germany the computer have no problem whith attacking you from behiend whith out warning then you kick their  and they want peace you refuce and take the capital and some how they make peace whith out you know it and you have to wait and in the mean time the computer talks bad about to the other contry saying you are the bad guy so they also wanna attack you you never know if they are your friend or they wanna attack you dislike",45.5
"game is great, new expacs make it great fun and adds alot of civs and its alot of fun playing on immortal and seeing ghandhi come and attack you with half a million nukes xd pros - game contains alot of fun and the modding community is great for keeping up the fun and adding new content cons - seeing missionaries and  inside your borders and not being able to attack them if you aint a  is really annoying. would 10/10 anyday.",401.0
"this game is one of - if not the- best strategy games on steam. its vibrant, exciting, and has near infinite replayability.",158.9

"complete edition on king uin . com 15 euro max +300 hours = profit",519.9
"it took only one time through the civ 5 game to appreciate it. now, its my favorite civ game (and i started with civ 1).",752.1
"great game! it blends together strategy, micro-managing, and action, to make the perfect genre!",552.0
"this game made me think strategy games are  anymore, ghandi has nukes too. 11/10 would bang.",59.6
"you can easily find yourself investing way too much time into this one, great game!",21.2
"if youve got the expansions, and you want to play with someone, hit me up! unless we dont talk much, then just stay away loser. jk, i would play this game with homeless kittens if i had to, and that would be really cute to do.",321.7
"civilization v is the ultimate strategy-turned base game. why? well mainly because every single move, action, order or whatever has a consecuence in the future (might be instant or in another era). the different personalities of the worlds leaders vary from warmongers all the way to peace keepers and makes the atmoshpere of the game much more realistic in comparison to other strategy games. before playing this game i was a fan of age of empires, i bought this game because a friend recommended it to me, now i hardly play aoe since the game in general is so poor in comparison to civilization v. the different possibilites to play in this game are endless and go from capturing all the worlds capital cities to be voted as world leader in the united nations. in conclusion, civilization v is the best option for strategy games fans.",532.5
"ill write this review... 1 sec... just 1 more turn...",69.0
"when i lost contact with my friends the ai in this game did suffice. overall a really fun game, can be a bit enraging if youre not prepared for a situation. 10/10",34.0
"when people discuss whether games are art or not, this is the answer.",798.8
"this is a good game for people able to sit down and play it but it takes a decent amount of time i think its a good game",544.7
"recommend dont critisize until youve played it good overhead strategy game which involves planning and thinking ahead of the game. graphics are fairly good for a game of this genre. there are a few bugs (mainly on multiplayer) none too noticable.. i cant go in full depth personally since i dont have a great amount of hours playing. have fun.",35.4
"i have been a long time fan of civ games and this one is just the natural progression of what has been a very good line of games. anyone a fan of strategy and 4x games would do well to play this. combined with the workshop, there is endless replay value to an already great game. i even recommend all the dlc, and that is something i rarely do. get it, play it, its good. 85% greatness. (where 50% is average)",678.8
"this game will end your life. get it at your own risk.",101.8
"i bought this game and was very satisfied with it as i had 22hours played within only two days. however i was later so mad that i nearly obliterated my computer as this fuc**** game shuts down whenever im about 1 hour in to a game in multiplayer, civilization v has stopped responding oh and if it was just that easy to task manager abort it, i wouldnt write this review, because, no it wont allow itself to be shut down, no no, it rather bug my task manager again. anyhow, let off from multiplayer this game is fantastic! 8/10 would play again!",174.7
"very addictive and a different game everytime you restart.",6.5
"an absolute must-have for any pc gamer. its easy to get into, while at the same time has a great degree of complexity. it has infinite replayability and can be a massive time sink. the base game is solid, but make sure to get at least the gods and kings expansion for a better experience.",157.2
"its a fun game and also a great time sink. would reccomend to anyone with alot of free time and nothing to do.",352.5
"good game, but remember, a dead ghandi is a good ghandi",94.4
"simply the best world domination simulator on the market.",667.2
"no words can explain how great this game is! 11/10 :d",22.2
"my god civ v is such an addicting experience. while it might not be the perfect grand-strategy experience, it certainly achieves what it tries to do. like every civilization game, its played best with expansions, and both brave new world and gods & kings are wonderful addons that really add to the experience in great way, the world congress is a perfect addition to the game, and that is just one of many features that these expansions succeed with. i dont really know what makes civ so addicting, its just so varied and you can either play as a warmonger or a peacekeeper, its up to you. this is one of my favorite games ever and ive had so much fun with it, as i will continue to have. if you like turn-based strategy, this game is a must.",427.4
"this game is emaculate in my opinion, par the ocassional issue with playing with people across the pond... whether you enjoy smashing the ai or making alliances and betraying your friends.. this game is one of the best strategy games out there for it.",174.1
"what a game, hugely reccomended to people who are interested in historical games, for me its like the total war series but you can start from the beginning, and thats what i enjoy, manipulating technology! but warning gandhi.",321.4
"you know its a good game when you keep pressing play game in the store during the trial version but it wont let you play it at all.",43.1
"playing all the time, when i am feeling a strategist",15.1

"amazing, territorial expansion is slower than civ 4 but it is still great.",66.2
"civ 5 one of the best games it is so good words cant describe if you get this get all the dlcs because if you dont your not playing it properly. when playing this set aside a whole day maybe 2 from my experience dont trust egypt... they hate me.. some say dnt trust ghandi i say hes a nice guy totally worth the money con a few friends into getting it and youll have the best time of your life one does simply not dislike civ 5",84.8
"love this game would recommend it, missed the first time expansions went on sale but got it the 2nd time arround",108.4

"probably the only game that i can pickup and play at a moments notice whilst still having the most complicated epicly long games where each game is utterly different. this game never gets old. worth every penny",74.4
"amazing game that forces you to balance between being nice with others and destroying your enemies to expand your empire.",425.6
"a great game many hours of pleasure, well worth it.",61.2
"an awesome strategy game. it is turn based but the good thing is that everyone takes their turns simultaneously so it doesnt take additional time. the game can still take awhile but i love how the put economy into the game so it isnt just about building a big army but can also be about building wonders, building cities, and a variety of other ways to get the most points and ultimately win the game!",24.4

"i had to quit because ghandi kept ing me over. 9/10 its ok.",38.4
"this game is hours of fun! each expansion pack adds a new demension to the game making it even more fun. this game can make you easily forget that there is a world going on outside your computer room. the game is awesome to play with friends. best installment of the series thus far. endless fun.",316.1
"i enjoy the game whole-heartedly and any problems i have with it are minute at best. except the problem of the base game being reletively dull, therefore seriously requiring the expansions in order to maximise the enjoyment out of this. other than that, it is an extremely enjoyable and addiciting game.",63.9
"it is fun, especially with my last man standing scenario mod.",664.6
"buy it. you will not regret it. i have over 450 hours and i still play this game like the day i first got it",527.9

"im following the series since the first game and i still love it, nice evolution over the past game. highly recommended but be advice that this game is highly addictived and will take away a lot of your time.",519.6
"this game to me is great fun, but you have to be into the style of game to enjoy it, if you like civ revolution, then you should enjoy this, there are flaws with the game mechanics, especially in multiplayer, main issue for me is a graphic glitch that cause the graphics to trip out, forcing me to restart, also direct x isnt a great engine, so glitches like this are expected. but on a whole the game is alot of fun, but more enjoyable with friends.",175.3
"im coming up to 100hrs in civ 5, so its probably about time i gave it some praise. make sure you get the complete edition on sale for around 8 in a sale. civ is a turnbased strategy game in which you build you empire across a randomly generated map. you compete against friends and ai to win the game, how you win is up to you. the game is at its best when its played in a boardgame night fashion with friends. get in google hangouts or mumble and chill out. the games last forever, so dont expect a quick fix. if you have 2 monitors the game gets even better when you can easily switch between civ and whatever- making those late game turns less of a bore. i really enjoy civ, its a lovely game for playing with friends and passing time. its a staple in most peoples steam libaries and if its on sale you should definately pick up the complete edition.",115.7

"perfect way to lose about three days of your life, all in one sitting, and its even better when you lose it with a bunch of friends with about the same motivation to nuke everything as you.",93.7
"best strategy game ever made with historical background and epic music. i recommend it!",387.0
"this game is a next-level strategy game. civ v is a masterpiece and now the standard for all strategy 4 ex games, and dont be suprised if you see more hex based games popping up. civ v isnt the great game it is without the expantions, unfortuantely, and you might think it wanting for more civs unless you get the expansions, which are huge by the way. civ v is another classic in the series, and it is an experience that you should want to be apart of unless you hate strategy games in general. this is one of the priemer games on pc, and is definately a must buy for any hard core gamer.",386.0
"glad i finally listened to my friends and gave this one a try. two thumbs up, love it!",106.7
"the game series that did more to define the genre it inhabits more than any other. complete with balanced gameplay and slick visuals.",395.7
"totally worth my life to play this game! you would not regret selling your soul to satan to play this!",106.5
"i like the game but they make it so hard to multiplay with someone sitting right next to you.",150.6
"best game to waste all night on. not recommend for people who have jobs with expected results.",478.7
"ive been playing for 36 hours straight. i dont remember if ive eaten. may or may not have pooped myself. but im taking that  gandhi down before i get up from this chair again. thats good, right?",396.9
"great game! fantastic visuals, realistic gameplay, and decent ai",42.8
"great turn based strategy game, they removed the issue with stacking units from older civilization games and some new improvements to gameplay, but dlcs are way too expensive.. they cost more than the base game...",43.8
"played for five hours and i havent even finished the tutorials :d 12/10 would play turorials again.",6.7
"sid meier is truly the king of strategy games. if you want a game where every move you make count, civ v is the game for you. to be honest its a bit tricky at first but you get hang of it after a bit.",209.4
"this is civilization at its best and over time it will ripen like a fine wine and become a masterpiece. 2k games have outdone themselves in making some massive changes without changing the core gameplay and alienating their fans.",60.0
"i cannot recommend this game enough.if youre into strategy games this is a must by, and its easy for beginners to get into.",262.5
"if you love stratagy, city building, and crafting your own empire, you will not be dissapointed 10/10",101.4
"some aspects are a bit dumbed down from civ iv, but the exansions will fix that and even exand on them. also combat is extremely improved, youll no longer lose attack helicopters to cavemen.",48.9
"excellent game. the best of the civilization games yet.",118.0
"love the replay value and the interesting aspects in the game. the technology tree, geography, and different civilizations keeps it fresh every play through. a standard game takes about 5-8 hours so you get a pretty good bang for your buck, and its not too hard to learn. i would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of turn based strategy games.",62.4
"this game just gets better and better. the spies can steal technologies, each ruler has specific unique qualities that reflect their place in history as well as offering opportunities to gain advantages over friends and the ai. the variance in map creation is also a blessing...it allows me to work on my weaknesses (naval battles) or cultivate creativity in new ways. the tech trees also help forge paths to specific victory conditions as well. just really fantastic gaming experience.",154.3
"this game is simply awesome, whole game is just one big high quality strategy fun fest.",64.6
"i love the game, but it wont play on linux for some reason. i play it on windows. hopefully the issues will be resolved in the near future unless it is my hardware. i have an 8800 gt card which is fairly old but it plays all the other games available on linux.",80.8
"great game! even though leonard nimoy is no longer doing the voice over for the game, which sucks it is still fantastic game! the steam workshop adds tons of well make civilizations and addons that one cannot fully enjoy this game without. i would highly reccommend this game!",46.8
"this is a great game. if you want to test your ability to strategize against a smart and aggressive a.i, this game is for you.",486.4
"one of the best strategy games of all time, so addicting, also the game mechanics are pretty awesome.",318.7
"i have played other games in the civilization franchise and have found this installment to be just as enjoyable as the previous ventures. i often find myself saying one more turn but i am just unable to quit the game. its strangely addictive. great game",128.0
"excellent graphics and smoothly transitions between turns. definitely stays tue to the civilization brand!",35.9
"simply put, this is one of the best games ive ever played. even with the vanilla civ v, i spent countless hours playing just one more turn. with gods and kings and the brave new world expansions, the game only got better. i paid full price for almost all the civ v dlcs and expansions, but it was worth it --- and i have more than 600 hours of playing time to prove it. ive had the sun rise on me many, many times, whether playing civ v alone or with friends. the depth and complexity of this game ensures that every playthrough will be different, every decision interesting. and as if the game isnt nearly perfect already, it still gets improvements 4 years after its initial launch! this game is a true classic, a standard by which other games of its kind will always be measured and is a must-have for any strategy game lover.",601.0
"exceptionally well designed gameplay, one of the most beautiful soundtracks ever composed and all that multiplayer supported. you like strategic board games and complex econemy systems? then this game is a must buy for you!",23.1
"great game i greatly enjoy this game even though i have only started playing it. its very casual with minimal micro managing and an easy user interface. those of you that have played sots ii will enjoy this game. this game could have a little better graphics though with more effects(its all about the nvedia phisx particles).",7.0
"i have spent far too much time on this game, simply because i enjoy the style of gameplay. after many times of playing it becomes slightly monotonous, but it is still highly enjoyable thanks to the different environments and opponents. i would still recomend this game, due to the fun i had conquerring other civilizations.",422.1
"what a great game. it enables you to play as civilizations from the past. as well as you can play it 100 times and each time will be different. the only thing that i would add is a canadian civilization.",447.4
"excellent, huge improvement over the last version!",85.6
"while it started out a little weak, civ 5 has grown, through its expansion packs, to be worthy of its pedigree. a masterful return to the series. if you love civ, pick this up and get yourself at least the gods & kings and brave new world expansions.",276.9
"i can say this is arguably one of the greatest games ive ever played. if you love diplomacy, war, strategy, and politics in general, this is the game for you. if you pick it up, at least pick up the brave new world dlc but try for the gold edition as a whole. you wont be dissapointed, i sure as hell wasnt.",93.0
"worth playing when youre listening to politics on the radio.",448.3
"is this game good? well i wouldnt say good... i would say it is awesome!!! seriosly, if you like turn based strategy games this is the game for you. it has everything you would want. so come on buy it and jump in a game! it will use up all your day for a single game sesion. xd",58.8
"from what ive heard, many people didnt like this entry into the civiliation franchise, but as a first time civ player i think its a wonderful game and is one of my favorites of all time.",238.3

"civilization v hits the spot if you want turn based strategy on a global scale. best civilization game to date and still. sid meier and his team have made a must play game.",232.0
"this is a fantastic game, i love games with a variety of routes you can take, which is exactly what this is. you could try to establish trade with other nations or just decimate them and take their land. however, at least on my computer, i find that when loading saved games, the game sometimes becomes riddled with graphical glitches. for example, i will load up a game and within a few turns, the map and all outlines in the game start flashing on and off. for me, this eventually leads to a crash in the game. im not sure if thats me, my computer, or the game. its still a great game though.",19.0
"finally, something to fill in for my lack of a linux compatible city simulator game. its not quite the same thing, but the ability to play with friends makes it fun in other ways. i hear the controls are just as non-intuitive under windows.",136.4
"if you like turn based strategy games, this is it!",118.7
"pls this gaem is amazing, if u dun liek it, u gtfo ok?",10.8
"engrossing resource management with a bit of randomizing historical figures for fun.",98.0
"i would greatly recomend this game for anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games. youll find yourself addicted to it in a matter of minutes, trying to become the worlds most cultural and military dominate empire. if you are not a patient person however you probably will not enjoy this game, because it takes alot of waiting and planning before you make your next move.",117.3
"pretty darn good game. gameplay is smooth and responsive and the ai is pretty intelligent. i like the idea of running a civilization and being able to conquer others. only thing is the dlc is expensive.",89.5
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",51.1
"i like the game very much, is realistic and enjoyable. 9.5/10",467.6
"civilaztion is a game where you are pitted against other nations to see who can become the strongest, smartest, and wealthiest. or, you can just beat the absolute crap out of the other players. i love it.",71.2
"this is a wonderful game that everyone should have",686.2
"i absolutely love this game. the dlcs are great, and there are some terrific mods out there. a lot of fun for a very long time. 10/10. would play again. i just cant even. only odd.",295.7

"a very good game with endless possibilities as loads of countries.",115.3
"dont trust gandhis innocent face, he will shove a nuke down your throat.",406.9
"damn, its getting late. i should probably go to bed... ill just play a few more turns. alright, one last turn. ooh, just unlocked railroads. ill just install a few before leaving... alright, thats enough for today. one last turn and im going. *fifty or so turns later* , rome has declared war against me, better get some units moving to protect my borders. okay, last turn. hmm, i should probably heal my units before i forget. *a hundred turns or so later* alright. last turn. oooh... unlocked flight. sweet! okay, ill just build some fighters, then im going to sleep. *four hundred turns or so later* oh. my. god. just unlocked the nuke. i definitely gotta try it! :d",93.0

"ghandi-is-an- simulator 2014. 11/10 would get nuked by ghandi again.",12.6
"one of the better games that i have played. after you get started in a game, the just one more turn mentality is insanely addicting. i highly recomend this game even if you are new the turn based strategy genre.",290.2
"simple enough to get into easily, but with enough gameplay mechanics to take months to really master.",101.2
"an immense time-sink. the amount of variables in map generation, civilisations and the tech trees means you will never have the same game twice. incredibly fun and great to play with friends making secret alliances and sudden betrayals. thouroughly recommended.",196.9
"if this game was a potato, it would be a good potato. 8/8",115.2
"stop reading reviews and buy the game.. 69/10 - would have been 70/10 but the scumbag ghandi won..",125.7
"this game is like crack. turn based but complex. i have to force myself to stop sometimes.",118.2
"played with one with me mum before she died from and we ate her. still a good play, neh?",127.6
"bloody brilliant. the mods make this game even better, theres nothing quite like playing as the soviet union and crushing the us after a 3000 year cold war.",120.7
"this game is a serious load of fun; however, a single match can take ages. in the words of a good friend of mine, it would probably take less time to build an actual civilization than to finish one game here.",29.9
"most fun ive had getting nuked in a very long time!",352.6
"the jury is open on how civ v compares to previous games, but personally i havent enjoyed the series this much in a long time. some systems have been simplified, but it only serves to make more room for others to become deeper. empires are now creatures to be fine tuned rather than sprawling beasts, as the rule of diminishing returns will work against land grabs and conquerers. diplomacy is intuitive, and when that fails war is satisfyingly tactical. for decades civilization has held the crown as the pinnacle of open ended strategy gaming, and this iteration only strengthens its grip.",186.2
"obviously the staple of turn based games. i dont know how the strategy genre would be faring right now without this game out there. no faults at all. only ever crashed one time on startup otherwise no bad experiences. i was also surprised at the attention to the co-op aspect which was pleasing and unusual in games even in the same genre. hot seat mode which allows multiplayer on the same computer definitely allowed me to introduce the game to several friends as well.",49.3
"this is the perfect strategy game ever created...yet. civ v can be incredibly relaxing as you take a huge  time planning and thinking about each turn. or it can be as mindblowingly intense as you watch your own hand crafted civilization fall to the hands of your long time friends (both ai or irl).",126.5
"great game to eat potatoes to. but seriously its a great game, the good old civ as we knew it. just as one would expect.",45.8
"gandhi threatend to nuke me if i didnt recommend this game",368.0
"fun little turn based, great for testing your wits, use mods to have added fun, 8/10 in my book.",226.3
"i spent many weekends playing this by myself...would reccomend",763.7
"i know people have some gripes with this game, but with the new expansion packs this game could be one of the funnest turn based strategies out there. its very unique and a very fun game to play at a lan party. i recommend this game.",142.9
"do not buy this game unless you want to get an addiction!",37.0
"my first game, i played the tutorial. met ghandi, lost the game when he rolled up with tanks. would reccomend.",11.6
"its like risk, but no one is liable to flip the table on you! the dlc is must have and the workshop community downloads are great for improving or mixing things up!",598.9
"hands down my favorite game series ever and it keeps improving and expanding.",175.0
"incredibly enjoyable strategy game with multiple ways to win and even an included multiplayer. downsides: multiplayer has a memory leak that took creative custom patching to fix (as i did not have the brave new world expansion) and play with friends. there is no real single player campaign mode.",159.3
"you will find yourself saying where did the last 20 hours go as youre sitting around at 1am on a sunday. just saying.",570.5
"an excellent way to try to rule the world. really, no part of this game fails to work.",42.8

"one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever played a must have if you play pc games",34.8
"civ. 5. the best turn based strategy game out there. of course, with beyond earth out now, its time is done. its still a really fun strategy game!",33.8
"good old civ, never gets boring ... if its not boring at the first place )",57.7
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",316.9
"civ 5 is an excellent blend of singleplayer and multiplayer. the singleplayer is fast paced and fun. it can also help you build skill in the game. the multiplayer is a great blend of backstabbing, friendship, and war. it is fun to explore different worlds and bring your civ to greatness and glory. overall, i give this game a 9/10. an excellent game!",74.6
"an amazing game so amazing i bought it a 2nd time with all the dlc for my new account. 10/10.",5.9
"one of the best games youll ever buy, cant wait for beyond earth! 10/10",253.7
"unlimited fun! not only is the base game great, but all the mods you can get really open the game up. be prepared to lose hours of your life!",87.0
"first time in the civilization series. theres a huge learning curve, but youll get over it. there are huge maps, and there are small maps. this game is awesome, so just buy it now during a sale before the price gets too high.",2.0
"be warned when you start playing you wont stop wirth every singel dolar good mod support and the best stradegy on steam",212.5
"one more turn will become your mantra. and all of a sudden, it will time to shower, shave, and go to work.",215.8
"aside from getting nuked by gandhi and getting indoctrinated by the rambo enemy missionaries, this game is more than worth its money.if you dig strategy games and have plenty of time on your hands to build your own empire from scratch on a world stage, then this is for you. only real complaint are the prices on the dlc-s, but thats just my opinion. 9.5/10",249.8

"passes vasts amounts of time in what feels like minutes",116.9

"pick babylon go pottery -> writing -> great library. geee geee",151.8
"great game if you what to waste hours of your life",21.9
"civilization v pares down a lot of the unnecessary elements and game mechanics that have been creeping into the series, bringing it down to a very polished set of basic mechanics.",103.9
"the first civ game i ever played, civilization v just completely impressed me in every way. the game has that just one more turn addictiveness and is very rich in gameplay. i highly recommed to those who like civ games.",224.4
"great game, the vast amount of ways to win and loose in this game make it full of replayabilitie to play as diffrent civilizations. games can last for hours and the back stabbing, the secret relations, war, this game is just fantastic. the game can get a little slow in the start, especialy if you are playing alone but it really pics up a few turns in especially if you play with freinds. if you play you will have a complete distaste for barbarians after you experience this game, 8/10.",99.3
"classic strategy gaming, awesome technology tree system, and epic customization options. 10/10.",13.2
"this game will destroy your life. youll be walking down the street wondering why you dont have to stop and wait for the other players to take their turns, and then youll think, oh yeah, i guess i can go a few more spaces since this is technically a road.",220.6
"a good game to build strategy and learn of some historical figures.",23.3
"best game ever. i can play this all over with excitement which is rare, and also problematic. 9.7/10",644.9
"cant even stack units, i tried for hours but it wouldnt work so dont buy this game. 3/10 poor quality",136.5
"this is a good starter to get into the strategy based games. its enjoyable and will suck up allot of your time without you realising it. i dont feel that the addon packs are all that worth it though, what is included with the game is more then enough.",29.5
"the game franchise speaks for itself. so, there is not much to add. for me, the best thing in civ is that i am never tired of it. i mean. sometimes i want to play something else, but after a few days or weeks i can play it again, as it was yesterday that i bought it. it fun for a long long time and so, buying it was well spent money.",390.4
"the new tile format really adds to the challenge level of the game. a definate improvement over civ 4!",23.0
"an unrelenting addiction. if you have important deadlines approaching then for the love of goodness dont start playing this game. however, if you have a few weeks worth of hours to spare, you will soon learn the joys of conquering the world as a vengeful gandhi.",78.9
"grab a 30 rack or 3, sit down with a few friends, and lan this game all day long. most fun ive hd sitting in one place for 16 straight hours.",157.8
"i could say so many good things about this game. but i am going to keep this fairly short. for any strategy lover or anyone new who want to start trying out new strategy games. this is the best place to start! its addictive, lots of dlc, generally just an extremely marvelous game! 10/10 by far!",207.4
"awesome game! not as much micromanagement as civ iv but for me that is a good thing.",171.1
"you wouldnt think a game about ancient civilisations would be fun, how wrong i was...",19.3
"one of the best strategi (turn based) game ever, and in civilization v, you can do a lot more then previous games, not only more civilizations, units, buildings, wonders but aswell new cultural victory, international trade routes, world congress, policies, ideologies, religion, diplomacy, espionage, naval combat, city states, and a lot more, what are you waiting for ? world domination by your hand is waiting...

"i havent played the game as much some other people that have played this game. but i have to say, this game is a game with a lot of depth and attention to detail. i havent played a game that kept me up as late as it has before. if you like sleeping at night, you might want to reconsider buying this game. however, if you want a solid turn based, diplomacy strategy game, i would definitely give this game a whirl.",27.8

"one of my favorite games ever i could play this games for hundreds of hours and never get bored, especially if im playing with a friend. highly reccomend 11/10",118.4
"it seems like every time i play a game of civ v or watch someone else play a game, it comes up with its own interesting, emergent storyline. whats going to happen this time? does gandhi beat queen elizabeth in a naval battle off her coast? does president washington, after eras of wresting control of north america from the other natives finally go east in search of the fabled new lands known as europe? who would win if genghis khan were to fight shaka of the zulu? these are some of the amazing stories you will get to see and be a part of in this game.",141.5
"it is really really fun. i got it not really knowing what it truly was. i just wanted to make the 2k sale worth it. but when i started playing, i was immediately entranced. i recomend it to not only fans, but everyone.",45.2

"10 hours at a stretch / 10 would stay up late again",348.4
"i start up a small, quick, earth-shaped map. and to make things quicker i set the era to the industrial era (a bit past halfway through the tech tree, the game becomes fun after that point). however, i turn on only domination victory. after conquering all of earth for the chinese, i realized that 10 hours had passed. this game is the ultimate time-killing addiction, and its a ton of fun, even for an impatient gamer like me. the game is actually very simple, but the way its designed makes it feel more complex. dont get if you want to do anything productive.",144.6

"if my  prolapsed 6 times in a row and ok i couldnt finish this review i crack myself up :)",14.0
"civilization v has given me a new hope for strategy games. as a person who has had little experience with previous civ games, i can say that it was still easy to pick up and roll with. all-in-all, the game isnt complex, but has many complexities working within it. from happiness of your citizens, to the amount of gold your making, everything you do is an important decision. i liked the idea of spying on other civs while protecting yourself from other civs spies. this game will give you a new patience for movement and decision making when trying to make your civilization dominant.",29.0
"civ v is a really good game for those strategic, thinking gamers out there. and you dont even need a knowledge of world history because you create it! yes, i know its not an indefinite amount of possibilities (though that is a drawback for some people) it has a bunch of other things. the original game only has a certain amount of civilizations, though, so if you have enough, buy it with an expansion (or two) and as many dlcs as you can afford, because i assure you it is worth it. i would give this a 9/10 because of my tastes. i mean, i love the game, but as a game you control without an indefinite amount of possibilities, i am one of the many people who find that a drawback. other than that, its an amazing game!",45.9
"honestly? ive played civ 5 for hours on end, but i still prefer civ 4. there, i said it. still a good game though!",635.6
"if rtss arent your thing, this game does the job, no zerg rushing, just ghandi and his mission to destroy your life and civilization. so remember to rip out and eat his heart to gain his courage, his tasty courage....",353.4
"really good game, great soundtrack, lots of in-depth options and creative maps. it feels like a classic board game like risk but with way more options. the only problem is that you cant really play a game in one sitting, since a normal game is already like 8 - 12 hours. the modding community is great, adding free and creative civilizations in the steam workshop. this is definitely one of the best pc games out there. if youre into stragedy games, play this!",26.3
"decent game to play when you are bored  of playing everything else. not as good as the previous civ game",707.4
"hey, got twenty hours to waste? civilization v is the one turn-based game that has me saying one more turn. most i am able to leave rather quickly whenever i need (such as moo, or galciv), however there is something in civilization v that just forces you to play that next turn to try and set yourself up for your next session. interesting visuals, dlc already added freely to the game, and a completely supported modders distribution system helps make this not only the most complete, but also a quite improved entry into the series.",48.6
"very fun game. you can get caught up in it very easily. better with friends",26.7

"get this game if you plan on also getting the gods & kings expansion to go along with it. the revamped combat and naval warfare systems, along with the introduction of religion, really round out the base game.",627.3

"great game, civ v will provide one with countless hours of stragetic fun. there is more than one way get a victory in the game which will provide many options on how to arrive to one. eac dlc only improves your experience and adds more hours of fun. the civ series gets better and better, so far this is a must have for anyones library.",366.7

"im allowed to discover the internet before even inventing computers. impecible. 10/10",117.3
"the one thing that the civilization series lacked, for me, was tactical combat. civ5 adds this new layer to the game, and the result is fantastic. unfortunately, the civ ai has never been formidable in warfare and, with this more complex war system, the flaws are more noticeable than ever. nonetheless, this game is extremely engaging and re-playable, a very easy recommendation.",333.9
"great strategic game. some wierd bugs, but i guess my biggest complaint would be how mch the expansions cost...",74.1

"in my professional life, i am a political scientist who studies political violence and international relations. i have spent many hours in this game for both fun and creativity. i love seeing how gamers choose to engage in a variety of foreign policy decisions in multiplayer games. civ 5 can teach us quite a lot about the average world leader, and it can be damn fun at the same time.",251.4
"very cool game, ive played about 10 hours worth and still have no clue what im doing, looking forward to seeing what i can do though :d",15.6
"amazingly addictive and intense strategy combat situations strongly recommend trying this game.",15.7

"over 300 hours playing this game and i still have only seen a portion of the content available. the best turn based, 4x strategy game i have ever played. the expansions are a must as they are literally game changers.",378.4
"although this is one of my favorite games, if you dont currently own it, i would hold off. the one main reason is that the dlcs are moneygrabs (but dont get me wrong, they really change the gameplay of the game). if you love strategy games then this one would be perfect for you. in hindsight, i would have waited to but it (i bought the gold edition) simply because they continually release dlcs that arent the cheapest (for example: brave new world and gods and kings)",123.9
"freaking awesome game, tons of ways to win and many avenues of approaches!",47.1
"this game has very fun, addictive, and well polished gameplay that makes you play for hours on end without realizing it. i recommend getting either or both of the expansions for the game, as they both improve the gameplay greatly.",304.4

"all time favorite game, ive palyed for hundreds of hours always on huge and have yet to finish a game, but its about as perfect as a game has ever been to me. if you like strategy with actual diplomacy and trade, this game with all of its expansions accomplishes it.",425.1
"i like the smell of an enemy empire in ruins at 4 am.",187.6

"great linux port of an already great game. the base game is great, but the brave new world makes it even better. thanks for porting to linux!",69.2
"loved this game, always just wanting that one more turn before you quit. even the vanilla game itself is expansive, immersive, and has tons of content. i have yet to get bored of the base game, as there is so many different ways to play this game, whether its to gain a culture victory, science victory, diplomatic victory, or domination victory; all these types are exciting and intuitive to play! i would recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy games",101.1
"greatest strategy game off all time! sid meiers civilization v is just an unbelievable creation, it contains millions of elements, you can win the game with up to 5 different ways, war-path is not necessary, you can complete and win the whole match without being war with anyone!",46.9

"have played none of the previous civilization games, i didnt expect to get a whole lot out of this title... but i was very wrong! the turns move quickly, the game is easy to get into, and the maps are fun to explore. plus, its fun to play co-op with friends against the ai!",82.0

"it is a fun game of strategy and can go any way you want",29.5
"only really fun for me in short game times. better with multiple friends. 8.5/10",155.7
"great game, but even better with the brave new world or gods and kings expansion packs. i highly recommend this for anyone. very easy to learn too, and has mod support!",66.9
"civilization v is the latest iteration of uncle sids brainchild, and to say the least the direction in which the developers took with this one has me torn. the new combat system (switching from squares to hexes, no unit stacks) is addictive, but reduces the scope and scale of the game by such a margin that your mighty empires dont appear to be as grandiouse as they were in the previous installments. however, the visuals are top notch, the new social policy system is incredible, and its first expansion gods & kings brings back what everyone missed from civ iv (religions and espionage.) all in all, it isnt my favorite civilization game, but civ v is most definately worth purchasing and putting ungodly amount of hours into.",493.6
"the father of turn based strategy games. best installment yet.",76.6
"a great game, a classic, the chess of simciv strategy games",232.5

"just one more turn.... *72 hours later* 10/10 easily the best turn-based strategy game on steam.",83.8
"civ is brilliant, definately worth the money, especially for the multiplayer.",175.3
"sid meiers civilization v is a game that has attempted something that very little games ttempt to do, and that is to have someone create an empire, and make that empire stay, despite war, religion, politics, money. a great imrpovement from the fourth version of this game, the fifth bersion, right now, manages to remove the stacking of units, and add tons of new troops, new technologies, new empires and their leaders, and is an all out better game than before. this is the thing that will be last compared to a waste of money.",133.3
"do have friends? then the best use for them would be to play this game with them. the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is engrossing, and the concept holds it own. you really should pick it up and become a master of civilization!",373.4
"sid meiers civilization v is a great turn based strategy game with interesting game mechanics and great historical progression. although the game has a big learning curve it is great to play with friends once you get past the learning curve. beware if you do get into this game days will pass and it will have only felt like minutes.",168.7
"great game thatll make you forget you were supposed to be somewhere hours ago.",269.0
"i cant help but recommend this game. hours of playtime at a reasonable cost.",239.9
"the civilization games were always top notch, and the following always better than the previous. the civ5 has one downside compared to civ4 - abscense of the planet view. that was fun. aside from minor differences they are pretty much the same - quite good, balanced and both easy to grasp and variative, - games. i totally recomend it, but only with all dlc and gods and kings addon. without those theres just no reason to get it instead of civ4. and when it comes to it, the game is massively overpriced. to my mind, for no reason except love of the fans for the series.",23.8
"still a solid game after so many years. cant wait for beyond earth.",52.4

"its a good civ game, on its own right, in the absolute sense. if you just walked onto it with no comparison to anything but tv and books, this would be a fantastic game.",107.0
"play as a variety of civilisations in a fight to survive. will you be a warmonging country, going for fast expansion and a conquest of the world? will you be diplomatic, aiming to trade and ally? will you be sneaky, pretending to ally with a country and then wipe them off the face of the earth? there are so many options, and each country has a relevant perk. very much true to history... which you can rewrite! did japan take over korea? did spain destroy everyone and control the map? or did germany choose to be a friendly, negotiating country? its up to you in a world of endless possibilities. another must have. my game library wouldnt be complete without it. and neither is yours.",81.2

"any game in which i can play as dr evil trying to conquer big boss so i enlist the help of equestrians and spartans, im most likely that i wont have a bad time.",460.8
"i played this game. why i still play it: 1. trying to outcompete that annoying oda. 2. i likez nukes 3.lead conquering armies to conquer almaty. 4. scare civilizations with your sheer might that when they want peace, you get all their stuff.",142.6
"gold edition doesnt include brave new world. very misleading. its a good way of ing me out of a few extra dollars though.",72.6

"one of the best real-time strategy games you will ever play",222.2
"great game. challenging at times but always enjoyable.",248.5
"absolutely love this game to pieces. its great for a social occasion, get everyone with their mics on and play a game, even if it does cause bigger fights than monopoly. my biggest issue however, is that the achievements someimes dont unlock, which although dont count for anything can still be awfully annoying.",235.7
"may not seem like fun, but yet it is and addictive as ! really recommend",43.8
"freaking amazing. best top-view strategy game i ever played. i love how you can control who is in the world and the difficulty level, map type, etc. i felt like i was competing against real players when i was faced with the ai leaders in the game. i actually checked to see if i was in multiplayer somehow by accident. 10/10",61.2
"best turn based strategy game i have ever played. it is very detalized, and you will enjoy it if you want to simply overtake the whole world or play a very difficult game. it suits all levels. it has many things done to it in workshop as well. there is so much to tell that you just have to try it yourself. as i said. best i have ever player.",82.3

"this game is great for ruining reltionships. dropped a nuke on my buddy, he wouldnt face me for the rest of the week. 10/10 would nuke again.",289.2
"before playing civilization i was skeptical about how addictive it was supposed to be, boy was i wrong. nearly 100 hours in and im terrified of starting another game because of the way weekends disappear. i hadnt played the game without its expansions but with them the game feels fluid and complete with early, mid and late game requiring changes to focus and strategy. highly recommend.",102.9
"what a great game so far... i havent really played it multi yet, but single, online or off, is fun! i recommend this game to all my friends!",41.8

"great turn based strategy, with some interesting new gameplay mechanics compared to the previous games.",221.4
"highly addicting and lots of fun. you really need to put your planning skills to work in this crown jewel of the series.",219.7
"one of the best strategy games of all-time, without a doubt. the sandbox mode is unparallled in scope-- every playthrough is completely different. the ai gets really, really tough at higher difficulty settings (emperor / immortal / deity), which keeps things challenging in singleplayer mode, to say the least. the workshop has some amazing mods as well, which add to the experience considerably. this game guarantees a thought-provoking challenge to all. 10/10",239.6

"great game, a little bit complicated at first but you learn as you go",18.9
"this is basically a civilization reboot for people that arent micromanagement heavy. it has a gorgeous interface, amazing flow, and theres always something to get your attention. the way the city-states interact is half the fun. definitely try it out. edit: been playing this game for three years and man does it make me want to go woooooooooooobeeedooooooooooooooooooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee cribble snibbins",30.9
"ok first thing first i have played this for over 500 hours good grief. i love this game and must say do not play if you want free time you will not have any.",600.4

"honeslty, with all the expansions, who wouldnt own this game?",255.3
"never before have i had a game that is equal in fun with its multiplayer as it is in its singleplayer. weither im owning my friends with babylon or crushing ai with germany im always having fun. absolutly worth the price it offers for the game, plus the expansions are worth it and add so much to the game... overall one of my best steam purchases",767.4
"great game and definately very happy, as always from the civ franchise. the new features are definately a great addition to the franchise and the dlcs definately dont disappoint either! definately worth a buy.",238.6

"engaging and offering many layers of challenges. the feeling of accomplishment and acquiring a skill at championing culture is in the face of opposition is both mentally and graphically a lot of fun.",147.4
"civ v is a a great game, provided you have the gods and kings, and brave new world expansions. vanilla civ v is clunky and incomplete. but with the addition of the two expansions this game turns from a dud into the best game in the franchise. i highly recommend buying this with the two expansions, if you can afford it.",309.5
"i was one of the masses who at first lamented the loss of stacking units. after 100 hours in i realize it is the loss of stacking which really makes this the best civilization released - having been an active player since ii was released. strategy and challenege is so much more apparent in this game it is hard to imagine going back. if you really want to treat yourself watch the making of video in included in your game files after a purchase. maybe embarassingly, my heart swelled with pride in being a player of the game after watching it. civilization is an integral part of pc gaming and always has been. civilization v raises the bar. may god almighty on high keep this series alive for as long as my fingers can click a mouse on a hex.",228.7
"10/10 this game is so cool. i would get it if it was on sale or not it is so good",28.6
"warning: more addictive than your favorite designer drug.",140.9
"sid meiers civilization v is beautifully designed. ive only played civ iii before this installment, so i have little to compare it to, but civ v feels much more real than civ iii, and compared to civ iii, it is much easier to get to grips with. one of my favourite features is the ability to construct various wonders, and trying to be the civilisation with the most wonders. gods and kings is a fairly good expansion, but adds very few readily seen features. brave new world functions well as making the late game far more interesting, introducing a far more complex diplomacy system, as well as the overhauled culture system (now with added tourism).",365.5
"get used to saying to yourself one more turn then ill go to bed",92.5

"have you ever sat down and wondered i want a game where all you have to do is make sandwiches for cats? well then you came to the wrong place, because this game will take you on a journey where every turn is a new adventure. you can destroy nations, launch nukes, make cats sandwiche- wait......... no, yeah thats right. so i recomend you pick up this game as soon as you can 2/10 would play again.",20.7
"its a very good game. time consumer yes. can take a whole weekend on a single game. not the best when playing only against ai opponents, religion is kind a dumb system if compared to civ iv, also why no technology trading? still i recommend this game.",199.2
"ghandi nuked me for helping him 11/8 would gift him money again",365.6
"this is my most played game on my steam account to date. this game has sucked 100+ hours away from me and i enjoyed every one of them. i highly recommend you pick up this game. final verdict: one of the best games i have ever had the pleasure to play",141.8

"i love this game! this is one of my favorite games to play, but i dont like how the dlc costs so much",156.6
"if you are into strategy games, this is one of the most challenging ive ever tried. its fun and exciting like its predecessors. i would say its one of the better games ive tried. and if you dont find it as challenging as i do. well you just jump to deity and see if you can keep up your pace!",562.5

"this is a very addictive game, there are so many options for the maps and the opponents and everything, there is technology, history, science, culture, strategy, warfare, tactics, and more all combined, i created a game with all 14 civilizations and i have spent 3 days on just that game, and it is still not finished, but i have a glorious empire soon to crush germany, then either the empire down on the bottom right or egypt. my idea is play with large continents, take over one of them completely and then fortify it and do what you wish from there.",102.5
"very fun and interesting. the game runs well and has an interesting gameplay style. but sometimes the trades can be total bs",260.0

"ever wanted to waste a week of your life without knowing that you did? here is your answer.",121.4
"i was not expecting to really like this game when i first got it, but i ended up loving it! the turn flow has just enough hand holding to make it simple on casual players, but it appears as though there is also a lot of depth for more hardcore players.",381.4
"warning will cause the following: sleep deprivation, insanity, nightmares, keyboards smashed to slithereens, yelling at your computer screen, loss of friends, tempertantrums, countless sleepless nights, depression, severe depression, and frequent visits to civ anonymous. 10/10 would play for months straight",322.8
"this is a absoloutsly fantastic strategy game, the best of its kind. extremely, highly reccomended.",122.2
"sure, it starts out slow, but once you take out an entire nation you know, you just know, that this game was made for you.",71.2
"this game is like monopoly, there is only one guy, that one guy, whos hard to tackle. (gandi!!!!!) but when you are that one guy, you win! but serious, this game is awesome! only hogwarts is better.",193.9
"just one.. more.. turn.. i promise! this time.. trying to convince myself to go to bed while playing in to the wee hours of the night.",268.3
"i personally enjoy this game very much and find it fun to play, the graphics are pretty good and it doesnt get boring.the only problem i have with it is the builder automation wont build roads as it did in civilization 4.all in all that is just a minor inconvenience and almost everything else about this game has been improved from civilization 4.",15.1
"amazing strategy game! i love the new hex tiles and combat system. adds a whole new layer of strategy.",136.0
"fantastic, watch the hours of your life wash away before your eyes as another classic civ sucks you in. even better with gods & kings.",289.7
"i actually liked it really well, better than civilization revolution",25.4
"i would like to make some points on why civilazation 5 is a great game for every one. i first would like to start with the civilazations leaders. they made a great decision with the first game. the last two dlcs have been a great addition too everything including the leaders. now with the gameplay. you start out with a settler and a warrior unit and first need to settle your city. after you get going people awlys turn on you whcih is annoying but it happens xd. combat is good and realistic but it gets harder as the difficulty goes up. you need to really play itt o see everything and everything (trust me anything can happen) in this game ive played over 300 hours lol. so great civilazations, gameplay, and leaders so when u learn the game... it becomes so addictive. so i recomened this game! :)",319.8
"a few significant strategical deficiencies exist in the base version of civ v. the game is genuinely unbalanced without both the brave new world and gods and kings expansion packs. if you can get the whole civ v package for a reasonable price, go for it, but i do not recommend purchasing the base game by itself.",358.3
"still th reference in turn-based strategy games, and as addictive as ever!",366.3
"this game is absolutely incredible. if you are on the fence about buying this, just pick it up when its on sale. i initially was sort of put off by the negative reviews stating the game was buggy, too easy, broken, etc. no, its incredible. just pick it up when its on sale. make sure you get the gold edition, as it will include all of the dlc that add to this game greatly. --buy it--",18.0
"best strategy game i have played it is complex yet simple, alot of civs, my favorite multiplayer game, and you can make so many storys out of it. ultimatley it has a place in my heart one of my favorite games ever.",324.0
"great fun game to play with mates or solo. hours and hours of fun.",54.5
"ill finish this review after ive had... one... last... turn...",135.9
"200+ hours of playtime cant be wrong. and there are so many ways to play this game.",244.5
"the most peacefull civ game. certainly war is always an option, but it remains just that, an option. the ai is less agressive and prefers peace most of the time. especially when compared to older civ games (until it has nukes xd). features: - highly modable (at this point i never play with less than 40 mods) - strategic combat: no unit stacking, most units follow rps design, ranges varying from melee to 4 plots - world generator produces really nice playable maps shortcomings: - i miss borders shifting with cultural pressure and vasal state system from civ4 - diplomatic status should be displayed better or at all",833.9
"the last civilization i played was civilization iii and after that i didnt expect, that i would buy another civilization, bcs the balancing was really bad, but in civ v the balancing is much more better!!! (in civ iii: enemies declared war, when you didnt gave them the atomic bomb in exchange for the wheel thechnology -.-) since it lasted a long time, when i played a civ before, i got into the game again really fast, bcs its really newbie-friendly. i really like the graphics of the cities on the map (tiny monuments :3), but the streets are horrible ^^ (maybe i upload a screenshot to show you, then you know, what i mean ^^)",57.2
"very fun game, it is very easy to set up a game for multiplayer and singleplayer. i would recomend this for everyone.",258.9
"you can play as armstrong against madoka, big boss and hitler",82.7

"well wicked. got it on the cheap on humble bundle tho lol.",164.2
"if you plan on playing this game on a mac, save yourself the trouble and find something else. there is a serious bug on mac which presents itself with all the symptoms of memory mismanagement (both the leak kind and attempting to access deallocated memory). do your due diligence and perform a few web searches to see for yourself the responsiveness of the game developers to the aforementioned issue. this is really unfortunate as ive played this game on a windows machine and it was a beautiful game.",37.4
"i just baught this last week...should of waited. great game if you enjoy taking hours of your day and turning them into a strategically turn-based time killer.",46.4
"the game is so rewarding if you put the effort into it. great game totaly worth the cost.",155.2
"epic and intense! i could put another 200 hours in that game ez.",310.3

"my favorite game to just relax with. even at higher difficulties i never really stress out with civ i just sit back and try to execute my strategies to the best of my ability and hope i dont spawn in a desert. dlc is well worth it since it adds so many new layers to an already complex game. multiplayer is a blast as well. always a good time to beat a friend to a wonder and listen to them rage over skype.",146.0
"this is a fantastic game to play. it has an unlimited replayablility, and is an amazing 4x game. this was one of my first 4x games and the civiopedia really helped me learn the game. i will play it forever!",214.2
"first civ game and love it. first turned based game too.",126.9

"love this game... i myself am a huge fan of the civ series",241.1
"awesome game just dont know why i cant play direct x 11...",38.6
"very fun game. it mixes the fun of building a civilization and conquering the world together. it has different things you can do like go for the science victory. there are quite a few victorys and characters making the game interesting. it generates new maps so you will have a new experience every time. i would give this game a 9 out of 10. i highly recommend you buy this game.",238.6
"this may not be the best installment of these series personally, but is by far the most entertaining one. a lot of detail was cut from the previous game but all in order to make the experience more dynamic. thanks to this, civ v has te best multiplayer of the saga. recommended for the hardcore fans, the casual gamers, the strategy aficionado on anyone with the slightest interest, this game is brilliant in all aspects.",45.5
"solid work from sid meier. expansions make for constantly updating game mechanics; so youll have to learn how to play all over again.",89.1
"great game if you have friends to play it with, as it could take a while to find people to play with online and when you do, they leave within the hour. great gameplay but must have friends that can play.",128.5
"this is an incredible game with a nice user-friendly interface and complex strategies. a lot of fun in multiplayer...defiently worth every penny :d",195.2

"great game with many strategy elements. its a ton of fun, and totally worth the price.",339.9
"interesting game, would no doubt get much better in multiplayer. can take a very long time, and doesnt run too well as the game progresses. sometimes gets a bit boring.",41.4
"the ultimate 4x game. its the most polished 4x game around, anyone who is interested in the genre should get it. it might not end up being your favourite, but you will get a lot of joy from this wonderful game regardless. just make sure to get the dlc.",151.9
"crashes on my 2013 13-inch macbook pro with retina display. im lucky to get two moves in before it crashes my entire computer forcing me to restart it. i want a refund.",42.0
"anyone who enjoys strategy will simply love this game. ive put in almost 10 days worth of playing time and i stil am loving it. simply an amazing game.",497.7
"civilization v is, simply put, the greatest strategy game of all time. i highly recommend this wonderful game to anyone even remotely serious about gaming; it is an absolute must. civilization v is easily a 10 out of 10, and stands at the top of the mountain as the undisputed strategy experience of a lifetime.",532.1
"quite addictive and a good bit of historical fun if you like turn-based games. they did a great job.",7.8
"most of the time i dont know what im doing, which is good cause no one else does either. enjoyable experience but you need to play with friends.",42.3
"10:00 pm: okay, this is my last turn. 4:30 am: god damnit rinse and repeat. 10/10",416.6
"amazing game that forces you to balance between being nice with others and destroying your enemies to expand your empire.",425.6
"great game, the lead designer was really into board games and the balance in movement is evident in this game. the hex moving system of panzar leader from the 1970s works perfectly like a complex and beautiful chess game.",258.6
"best turn-based strategy game after heroes 3! 10/10",601.7
"this is without doubt the greatest turn-based strategy game ever made.",184.3
"i cant help but try to win with a domination victory everytime i play this game. what is wrong with me....",229.8

"a cool game exept that the ai is  but otherwise this is an awesome game",240.2
"my sleep cycle has never been the same after a good dose of civ v. multiplayer is a bit heavy to play with constant lag issues.",136.5
"with the brave new world expansion this becomes literally the best point in the series. no stacks of doom, trading, religion, tourism...only thing missing is that espionage could be a bit more fleshed out, with spy units that could poison water and sabotage and whatnot.",123.4
"never got those 2d virgin waifus i was promised for getting this...",0.2
"fully expanded it is the excellent. much better than 4, and imo as good as fully expanded 3, which is still my favorite, but this is better overall. at its base version, i would play civ3:conquests over it any day, but you have to start somewhere.",115.2
"i barely even played before it quit working. tried 20 or more reinstalls, your steam server constantly loses communications, it i did get it loaded it would say unable to load something or another. constant issues. cant even play in offline mode anymore. a great game turned to crap.",16.3
"really fun, and really addicting once you really get into it.",109.0
"love it! this detailed turn by turn strategy game is hours upon hours of fun!",408.2
"great strategy love it, i played civ 4 love the improvments!",32.5
"civilization v is in my opinion the best turn-based empire building game to date. with over 20 civ with their own unique units, buildings and perks you will not be running out of a new strategy to try anytime soon. although i do recommend picking up the two expansion packs gods and kings and brave new world.",92.4
"one of the best strategy games available. the dlcs also add a huge amount of extra material and some great scenarios. great fun, if you dont have it, get it!",126.6
"this game is really fun and really historical. it was voted both the game of the year and strategy game of the year by gamespy in 2010. in a nutshell, this is the best strategy and historical game ever. i would recommend that you play this game.",10.2
"a great game for stratgey fans, civ 5 on its own is much simpler than civ 4 so fans of the series will not like it however all the issues are addressed in both dlcs and they and a tone of content!!",196.0
"im not usually a fan of 4x games, but civilization v managed to grab my interest and kept me pressing the next turn button over and over again. definitely get on discount.",4.4
"awesome turn-based strategy with loads of dlc, definetely one worth playing!",223.7
"never trust gandhi, that  has nuked me way too many times.",31.4
"so this is basically how a game of civ goes. start up the game. meet ghandi. oh thank god ghandi is suppose to be peaceful in real... wait... ghandi what are you doing? ghandi captures your capital and wins.",114.2
"firaxis and 2k are becoming my new favourite game studios, very much thanks to civ v and xcom... this is one of the most complete games ive ever played.",45.9
"excellent game, excells in all fields. highly reccomend if you like tbs",422.8
"this game is awesome. i admit i have a little obsession with this one. its one of them games where you loose half the day before realize you havent eaten or even gone to the bathroom. its turn based strategy at its best. and who doesnt like to conquer the world?",504.2
"never ever trust ghandi or germeny they will kill you",215.9
"on a scale of 0 to 10, gandhi is now 255 points of pure nuclear rage.",57.5
"the best civilization ive ever played there are a lot of dlcs availeble, which in my eyes feesl a bit like farming, i got myself a few but there are not much improving the game - but see for yourself. the game itself is super, you nice graphics, the soundeffects are a little bit annoying when you play it a long time, and if you start it is hard to stop, its quite addictive. so all in all it is worth bying",236.1
"such an addicting game. i honestly lose track of time when i play civ and i end up playing for hours. such an in depth and immersive world there really arent words to describe it. strongly recommend to anyone who plays rts games. one quick hint though . . . never trust france. ever.",206.4
"this fps is soo cool killed 100 space cowboys in this game it was great but the no regenerating health bar kinda sucks but love train simulators 10000000000000000/10000000000000000000",34.5
"this game provides literally hundreds of hours (or more) of fun. the randomness of the maps, the large amount of civilizations, the multiple different ways to victory, and the many ways to achieve that makes this game so unique that its impossible for it to feel repetitive. this is well worth the cost and definitely a game to get. now if youll excuse me, i have to get back to playing!",122.0
"good game for lots of people to play while drunk...",40.0
"if you love strategy board games like risk. this is definetly for you, lots of fun with your friends!",40.4
"been so long since ive actually played these games way back when. but ill never got sick of games like this one, love it.",399.2
"but did you get brave new world? did you? go get it! now!",420.1
"this game is like digital crack. as soon as you try it your hooked and sooner or later youll realise that its bad for you and pleadge to stop. you try  do you try but you always end up back here playing this game hour after hour thinking damn i need help. just as gandi nukes you",86.5
"playing as korea... get nuked by fupping ghandi this game is kind of stupid. it is a great 4x game.... it has nothing on civ 4",357.1
"a great continuation of the civ series, i love it!",168.0
"a very fun game. i was a newcomer to turn-based strategy games before this. ive been thoroughly enjoying it so far, and i highly recommend getting it if you even remotely enjoy strategy titles. everything is well executed, and seamless. on another note, it is amusing playing as the roman empire and having nuclear technology. beware, this game will eat up hours upon hours. but youll enjoy every minute of this game.",54.2
"really nice game if you like the turned based strategy stuff",93.4
"this is my go to game when i am not directly playing anything else. plotting the downfall of my enemies is enjoyable if slightly worrying. its a bit slow for me, however, i am still pretty new to rts games.",20.7
"if you wanted to dominate the world or live out your fantasies of becoming the ultimate scientocracy, this is the game for you.",46.5
"one of the most addicting games ive ver played! note to self: dont ever trust ghandi! 10/10",156.9
"until they fix this game i will not recommend this game! once their new games come out the seem to leave thier old games behind.",220.7
"it is a good game. until it crashes!! this is inevitable. you literally cannot finish the game. do not waste a penny on this.",143.6
"nuked most of my friends, lots of fights, now i live all by myself in this fallout destroyed earth. would do it all over again. 14/10",431.4
"the game is great, but the problem is me and many other players are facing the same problems. workers stop working and stop building roads, and they dont seem to care much for enemys they just stand there from time to time and stop working. this is making the game very difficult. pls help fix this i really love the game i spent so much time in it. i have send letter for help but got nothing.",65.2
"this game turns the phrase just one more turn. into the biggest 5 hour lie youve ever told. you will think, ill just fire up civ v and play a few turns before bed. at 10pm and the next thing you know, its 5 in the morning. even if turn-based strategy games arent normally your thing, you should still play civ v. its that good.",53.4
"who doesnt want to be the ruler of their own little empire and take over the world?",169.5
"amazing game, endless amounts of fun. with civ you can play for 6 hours solid and not even get board. i would recommend this game to anyone, for the people who dont normally play turn-based games spend about 1/2 an hour playing it and you have learn all the basics needed to have a really good time. should buy if you have the cash!",580.6
"brilliantly fun game, just play it now! ghandi gets nukes!!!!! nukes!!!!!",53.7
"a very nice tbs game, with great graphics and addicting gameplay. altough it misses some strong points from civ iv, you really need to buy it if you like civ. with upcoming dlc, updates and mods, youll never get bored!",321.4
"a very good game, with hundreds of mods at your disposal you can play the game for hours days, weeks even. i, myself , logged close to a thousand hours of gametime to this game. probably one of the best strategy games out there.",1070.3
"its been a while since i lost myself in a game, but i found myself enjoying this so much i ended up loosing half a day without realising it. its a super enjoyable game that id recommend to all, but do try the demo first if your unsure",29.8
"okay, not completely sure what all this stuff about getting nuked by ghandi is, but this is a great game. please get it.",34.7
"one of the best games ive ever played. unlimited hours of gameplay.",77.0

"played as ghandi, nuked everyone, twice, 5 stars a+ 4 stars!",81.8
"the civilization series is one of the best series ever. great diversity, great slighty changing ais, great gameplay all makes for hours and hours of re-playability. plus ghandi will try to nuke you!",265.7
"an amazing game about ruling the world, going to space, and dropping nukes. need i say more?",176.5
"its civilization v. if you love civ games, youll end up loving this one too.",28.0
"love this game. game play is excellent, but i do miss the cheats from previous version. i dont like that i have to run steam on mac to play it, the software slows down my computer, runs with out my consent, has to be manually configured to not launch whenever boot the machine for example.",81.8
"awesome to play with few people, but only if you can afford to buy all expantions. if not then simply buy one of previous parts.",256.4
"great game! it is kind of a slow game for multiplayer but the single player gameplay is great. i would reccomend this to anyone.",397.2
"simple, yet addicting turn-based strategy game that got me into the world of historical strategy games.",303.2
"a relaxing, immensely stimulating, and imaginative game. i recommend it more highly than anything else i own; wtih 274 hours currently on record, it is by far the game ive played the most. managing empires with the highly varied gameplay of random maps to explore and different alliances to make ensures that, at least for me, it never gets old. difficulty ranges widely as well. its the kind of game that can be played anywhere and is fun to show people. playing with friends is a blast, as you ally and compete on the global stage. if i could pick one game to play for the rest of my life, it would be civ 5.",289.0
"do you have hours to waste? like looking at maps and thinking? well then this will be like porn",56.3
"really awesome game. you might even learn some things from it.",127.4

"been playing civilization since the early 90s civ 5 is the best. i have logged close to 700 hrs on civ 5 and im still not bored!",948.8
"awesome game, highly addictive fun turn based game",88.1
"the best civ game yet and the dlc improves the vanilla version dramatically. the one thing that has always bothered me about th civilization series is the diplomatic side of the game is very basic and would love to see some more depth. i love the new hexagon map layout and the replayability of this game is excellent.",482.3
"amazingly addictive game, with endless replay value. only problem is that some countries can be rather predictable, gandhi will always nuke you, and china will always betray you if your friends then when you knock em back theyre like oh no were friends, couple turns later they betray you again.",374.7
"my jewish friend made me angry so i destroyed jerusalem -10 outta ten",110.2
"holy time sink batman, this is one good game. never played much of the first 4, but i really am enjoying this one.",27.2
"really enjoyed all the play time this game gives. i havent even touch online yet and im still having fun! some games take time but if you have time to speare then this is defently worth the buy. i run on a laptop and cant run alot of games but this has no problem providing a fun experence.",123.8
"i dont think its as good as 4 bu its still fun :) one more click.....",15.9
"very good and interesting game! played out-of-the-box for about three hours before i bought the gold upgrade in the steam sale. although once your civilization gets huge it can get slightly boring it has amazing graphics, especially when you talk to other rulers.",17.1
"very fun game to play on both singleplayer and multiplayer. great strategy game that allows you to test different scenarios that you choose to craft. highly recommended to you guys!",463.5
"a good small start-up strategy game. good for those who want city management, nation management, military management, and even diplomacy. dlc adds features found previously in older titles, but still the core game is quite good.",77.0
"civilization v is a fantastic example of a turn-based strategy game, in this game you get to play as one of a large selection of civilizations and take them to greatness or death, they are in your command. this game has streamlined ui, great ai and amazing replayability. if you like turn-based strategy games or games that you run countries then buy this game!",92.5
"one of the greatest games ive ever played, and of the civilization franchise it is certainly a great follower to civ2 which was and will always be my favourite civ!",175.6

"complete edition on king uin . com 15 euro max +300 hours = profit",518.1
"civ v is an absolutley incredible, immersive, and addicting game. my praise for this game truly cannot be expressed in words. if youre on the fence about buying this at normal price, just buy it when its cheap during the summer sale, you wont regret it!",125.9
"running out of holidays as i have to book days off for one game perfect game for people who are immortal or possess several lifetimes to play 10/10 recommended!",19.7
"who could ask for more than really time consuming games? i know i couldnt",148.7
"this game is beautiful. does it really need another recomendation? im sure youve heard of it or seen gameplay. one of hte absolute best turn-based stratgey game. p.s. if you get the gods and kings expansion, be prepared to look at an ugly pubic haired jesus wanna-be staring off into the sunset wandering where his life went wrong every time you start the game up... freaking hated seeing his face.",129.3
"just one more turn... one more... *falls asleep at keyboard*",463.3
"civilization v is one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing. whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast should play.",470.2
"this is the best and most well developed with expansions out of any previous iteration of the game. this is absolutely one of my favorite turn based strategy games of all time. there are a wealth of things to do between nations, map size, settings, and achievements. this is a 100% must have for turn based fans, and a great starting point for anyone looking into the genre.",415.6
"a good update to a good series. with the brave new world expansion, i think this beats out civ iv, which is no small feat. civ v is a very addicting game and easy to lose track of time in. the game can go many different directions. in addition, the modding community is very strong with a lot of really cool mods.",111.9
"requires a bit more careful planning, thought, diplomacy and time than other games ive played. bit of a time sink, but damn is it satisfying to one-up england with a people they suppressed and screwed around historically.",184.2
"this isnt game dosnt have the highest played hours in my library for nothing... well maybe its that the game takes days and sometimes weeks to complete... but with infinite play through possibilities its a game one could play constantly... :)",602.1
"fantastic game. offers hours of game play and makes time fly by.",45.0
"this is one of those special games that eat up time. having been a huge fan of civ iv, civ v feels like a fresh update.",69.8

"its no 3 but its still better than 4. ghandi is a , btw. 10/10 would nuke him again.",68.7
"not only the best turn-based strategy out there, also one of the best game overall. pressed play tutorial and played for 5 hours!!!! thats just the beginning.",28.4
"after a rocky release in 2010, much of the problems with the original release have been addressed with the expansions god and kings and especially brave new world, with the addition of trade routes, religion, culture victory overhaul and policy overhaul, and the world congress amongst other things. if you did not like this game in its original form, its worth a second shot if you get the expansions.",478.6
"an extremely addictive turn based strategy game that will keep you up all night for just one more turn. not for the average gamer however, as an average game takes around 6 hours :p",28.0
"great game but mainly only worth it if u buy all the dlc and it was deffinatly worth the $25 usd i paid. it is a great time stealer and keeps you entertained for hours",41.1
"this game is one of the best time-wasters out in the market! the fact that you can also mod the game is amazing! its a must get game!!!",752.4
"who earlier loved civilization should also buy here. it catches your attention for hours and makes the turn-based strategy honor.one only criticism is that it gets more profound with the latest dlc. various countries, various cards and much more awaits you in this part of a long tradition-rich game. go buy it",212.3
"ive played too much of this. if you have a decade to kill, go for it. world domination.",111.3

"its a fun game with friends, and theres always something to do. but its also boring and the same thing over and over. cities are too op. i think the game is good, not worth the price",40.1
"stop reading these reveiws and buy this game now!!!!!!! its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",76.7
"sid meiers civilization v is one of the best games i have ever played, but i would recommend getting the brave new world expansion as it enhances the gameplay greatly. i have literally spent hours playing with my friends, losing every time, but the experience of the game in itself is what makes this game truly remarkable. a masterpiece.",163.5
"look at the title. now back at my review, back at the title again. youve just bought civ 5.",6.6
"civilization 5 is one of the most recent additions to civilization series, which has been defining the rts genre for decades. if you have not played a civilization game before; civilization 5 is a great starting point. amazing game! sooo much fun single player, more fun with a friend! the expancion packs are a great addition to the original game and add alot more depth and complexity to the game. if you are new to the game consider playing without the expancion packs at first, and then add them on. i would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of rts games, is looking for a great single player experience, or has a group of friends to play with; as both the single player and multi player are hours of fun. 10/10.",243.4
"this game is epic ! sad that brave new world and gods and kings is so expensive !",55.7
"this game is practically endless and addictive. i have played over 200 hours of this game just to show you how addictive this game really is. it is a great game for any gamer looking for a turned base strategy game.",293.5
"a fun game without the expansion gods and kings, but with it, it becomes one of the best turn based strategy games ever made. fun in multiplayer or singleplayer, easy to run and max out. it also has a bevy of fantastic mods, all easy to install with the steam workshop.",278.1
"no other game feels as epic. the feeling of building a great empire that can stand the test of time is really where civilization 5 shines.",261.7
"super sweet game, will play forever. or until civ:beyondearth comes out",140.2
"dangerously addictive game. this game makes you sit for hours and forget time. all hours that fly away with sitting on this game is 1337% wurf. could not wish for better strategy game. 133769% must play for people with a brain.",190.6
"so last night i went and tried the game out because ive had it for a bit. i started it at 2am ish and the next time i looked at the clock it was 4:30am! that hasnt happened in a while for me and a game. stratagey is gread! the tile and turn based systems work flawlessly. its overall a really great and addicting game",16.6
"if your new to civ, 9.5/10, if your not it starts out being 7.5/10 then as you adapt 9.5/10. hard to adapt from civ 3 being the expansion mechanics are very different, but overall very good.",99.0
"excellent game. highly recommended. ai needs to be tougher. civ4 and previous ai would just beat you bleading in the night. civ5 ai is like the kid that just yells at you.",163.1
"an great turned based strategy game, with many new things to the series, but still not everything that th eprevious games had. just make sure you keep track of time as you play one more turn for hours.",405.6
"like 4x games? dont know what they are? probably wont enjoy this. i like them though!",2.8
"ive logged 250+ hours on this game and thats still noob status. maybe someday i will see my family again, but the war rages on and there are lands not under my grasp. just one more turn...",401.5
"where do i begin, civ v is the one of the best games i have ever played in my 9+ years of gaming. i love the strategy aspect and the fact that there are so many things you need to pay attention to in order to win the game other than other games being like ahhaha im just guna shoot and den i win haha. this game takes thought, intellect, and time. i highly recommend buying this game.",51.8
"awesome,awesome,awesome!!!! do i need to say anything else?",637.0
"i got this for a free steam weekend and i was hooked and i didnt want to get off. its just so awesome cause you get to make your own country/empire and you can make peace with other empires or go to war or trade with them and you can build roads its so fun. this will defintly get you hooked on it for hour and hours of playing it. 10/10",3.4
"another great game in the civilization series. a few small issues that were fixed with the expansions. worth a try if you are a fan of the series",36.9
"the dull technology is anti-historical .every nation has similar tech .you are mongols of steppes -no problem . you can still build lighthouse of alexandria or collosus of rhodes -both monuments strictly made by very prosperous sea-faring nations. it is ridiculous . further more you can not set era when you want to halt the advancement. i dont feel playing modern era ,but i can not do nothing about it . even more the scenarios are awful . some of them as short as only 70 turns long. they simple threw some uncooked pseudo historic technology into the pot because it would take few dollars !!! to give every nation the tech it really could have access before the modern era. there are lot of people whoo does not care about anything for them this game is perfect . if you feel like doubtful about central american civilisations having cavalry or other nonsense then this game is not for you.",9.7
"a worthy addition to this franchise. the new hex system gives players an incredible new way of thinking and plotting the demise of your fellow empires.",171.6
"a complex turn-based strategy game that is worth every penny especially with all the dlcs! there isnt a campaign mode but more of a set your own kind of game however there are scenarios you can play. just remember to never trust ghadi he will nuke you!",376.6
"great game, its always fun to see your civilization evolve from sticks and stones up to the nukes! this game can be fun in solo but also with friends which makes it even better because you can trade tactics together and do research agreements to speed up your domination!",178.6
"so gandhi approached me, and i was like, hell yeah, lets be friends with gandhi! he became gandhi the terrible of india. what. the actually. heck. other than that, a really fun strategic game that you probably need a looong time to finish.",6.2

"i could say so many good things about this game. but i am going to keep this fairly short. for any strategy lover or anyone new who want to start trying out new strategy games. this is the best place to start! its addictive, lots of dlc, generally just an extremely marvelous game! 10/10 by far!",207.4

"killed a knight with a bazooka best game eu m8! 15/10 ps: all hail to the zulus!",107.9
"to try and keep this brief, civilization five in one of the most refined strategy games on the market. the fact that even recently the game is still recieving both offical expansions, and user content should be a testament to that alone. building on the framework of pervious titles, and reworking nearly every aspect into a more streamlined approach might have back fired. yet, it still remains addicting and fun even after the years it has been released.",241.2
"ive certainly sunk enough of my time into this game. ive long been a fan of the civilization series, which has pretty much become the standard for turn-based strategy. this game brings a slightly more strategic approach to the classic civ gameplay, requiring that units occupy their own space. this makes grid movement much more important, as opposed to the enormous army stacks that the previous entries focused on. for those that are new to the civilization franchise, this game is not for those who want something they can pick up and play for an hour or two a day. its turn-based, so technically you can play it like that, but you probably wont. typically if i start a game at 2 in the afternoon, ill be finishing it up at 4 the next morning. so if youre prepared for that kind of commitment, i highly recommend it. :)",414.0
"i like to play this game. it makes me happy. if you want to be happy, i recommend you play it too.",59.3

"its not as good as civ iv but its still pretty good. couple things they got rid of that i miss. no more unit stacking, the hexes instead of squares, and the elimination of the science bar. i miss those features. i still recommend it.",54.4
"if you love strategy games, you wil love this game!",123.4
"dis gam ta bestt eva.. this game had me non-stop playing for a whole weekend. i recomend this to anybody really. unless you cant stand turn-based then this is the best game ever. 10/10 cities will destroy",49.3
"i find it hard to believe anyone is really reading reviews for this, as this is one of those games that i feel you either are already intimately familiar with, or want nothing to do with. that being said, if you are into strategy games and have never played this, i would advise you to get this the next time steam throws it on sale. if strategy is not your thing...dont.",141.3

"i enjoy playing civ, and even though i enjoy it, matches can take a good while, even on quickpace turns. new tech would go down well along with a new range of different civs, and maps...even a sandbox map maker would do me too.",148.1

"beginning to ruin my life. 11/10. would nuke ghandi again.",29.6
"this game was surprisingly good. i dont like strategy games but this one was awesome",27.1
"right, so first of all if you dont like history, bloody battles, advances in technology, ancient civilizations or just cool stuff. this game isnt for you. civilization v is a history gurus dream come true, well into a game atleast. as soon as you dive into civilization v, you might not come out of your room for a few weeks, also if youre a student in school expect to see your history grade rise...",404.8
"hands down, this is the best civilization yet. the graphics, trades, and politics of the game are perfect ways to pass countless hours of time without you even knowing it.",19.4

"anyone wanting a tactical and sometimes unpredictable game will be satisfied with jjust playing the game. anyone wanting dificulty will be satisfied with the harder modes and the same for anyone wanting an easy game. highly recommended to buy.",108.9
"this game is so much fun, its like a time machine. open it up, play for what feels like an hour, suddenly its the next day and youre late for work!",319.6
"seriously, hi is one of the best games ive ever played. theres amassive world, aninfinite amount of possibilities for playhrough, and a great community in the steam workshop. especially great with the gods and kings + brave new world dlc. also, really appreciated the mta nui map mo. brought back some memories.",172.6

"its a very fun strategic game thats kinda like coh but has alot more things to choose from.",83.9
"once you get used to the new way things work compared to civ 4 its a lot of fun!",12.1
"very enjoyable and flawless game that is a perfect time sink. defo buy if you have the chance too.",1.2
"this is a great game for anyone wishing to continue their civ experience. it plays a bit differently than civ iv, but in interesting new ways.",393.1
"its civilization, no stacked units, more strategy, less tilling and it time wastes great.",166.1

"probably one of the best games around. it isnt like age of emires where the whole job is to kill everyone, thats comes late in the game. you work with real world leaders, make alliances, and get some really mad and if you do decide to go fight a war, then be prepared to fight. i decided to try to take down egypt and that war lasted over a 1000 years in the end i just gave up and went back home.",114.9
"never, have i ever, not even once... had a session of this game that was not a complete blast. what cant be said about civ v. its the peak of gridded strategy games, not only will you have to plan out what direction you want your civilization to go in terms of how cultured, scientific, wealthy, and happiness, youll also have to keep track of the plots and connections of various city-states and of course, other civilizations. you can play a plethora of leaders to be the ruler of your civ, each leader is unique and different to play; however, they are all fun to play, theres no real bad or op leader. the real fun of civ v is the mulitplayer, whether you hop on a public server or have a match with your friends, civilization will have you laughing, sweating, cheering, crying, and swearing. ~from a player with 60+ hours, and no completed games. i <3 this game.",95.7
"when people point to console exclusives and say the pc doesnt have any i simply point to civilization v, the civilization series is the best strategy franchise ever. youll feel like an evil mastermind as you plot world domination, and the expansion packs gods and kings, as well as brave new world bring new life to an old game.",299.6
"civilization v is a reboot of the series in some ways. over the years, they kept adding mechanics until the whole thing got kinda bloated. they rebuilt things from the ground up for this one, keeping the core essence of the game intact but streamlining the bloated systems. i love it. i absolutely love it. it took some getting used to, as a fan of the series, but i feel like this game, like the others before it, is yet another improvement on the formula. for people who havent played any civilization games before, this is one of the most famous simulation series of all time for good reason. if you have any interest in the genre, its worth getting.",167.2
"this game makies the hours you are playing it seem like minutes",1004.4

"welp, 1.) im very picky about games 2.) i dont usually go for games like this. 3.) i was pretty skeptical when i got it. i dont regret anything, its an amazing game. except if youre looking for friendship... i asked william for friendship about 13 times and each time he denied me until i took over all his cities. and now brazil hates me... so yeah thats cool. 15/10 would get again <<<",71.0

"this is ranked as my number one game out there. this requires thinking and strategy on how to play your game and each decision you make changes the course of the whole playthrough. would highly recommend this to people who are looking for strategy games and want to challenge themselves.",433.5
"great game. basically the latest/best civ. only real negative for me is that they seem to have simplified diplomacy/trading (cant trade maps,etc..)",163.0
"it is a very detailed game and even if you think you are a pro player you will still learn tons of new things that will improve your skils. btw never play it before going to sleep or you will end playing it by the time when you should wake up (when your lucky)!!",97.1

"a truly amazing turn-based strategy that will have you gritting your teeth all the way through, i would 100% recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested in the stategy genre. now if you excuse me i have to go and kill babylon this game keeps pulling me back for more!",89.4

"with way more than 200 hours of gameplay (steam is always about 40% of what i actually played), this is my most played game in my library. this is not the greatest game of all time, but it is probably in my top three, with portal 2 as the greatest game of all time. while this game does take long, it is worth it and very consuming! i love this game and i would most definitely recommend it! i love this game!",231.5

"this game is awesome. so many countless nights spent playing.",141.3

"i absolutely love this game. its hard to stop playing it. if you are looking for an addictive strategy game, this is the game to buy. with so many different types of scenarios and mods you can incorporate, theres literally no end to this game. strategy games were never my cup of tea until this game came along. its hard to point out anything that is being done wrong in this game and the expansions make this game even better.",604.3
"single player is fun, i have been playing it a lot the past week and even though i feel like i still dont get everything i dont have to in order for it to be fun. after getting a really good deal for the game and all existing dlc, i feel like i havent even scratched the surface in things i can do. only major complaint i have is that players online suck. not as players, though they will mostly pick overpowered civs to try to compensate for something... no... as people they do. they will quit the first time something doesnt go their way (lose units to barbarians cause they are being dumb, lose out on a world wonder they were building, etc) to the point where you are playing against all ai before you can even build up an army to face the other civs. that takes all the fun out of trying to play online.",417.5
"a very good strategic game but requires a lot of patience and time. gripping adventure to conquer nations in peaceful or war ways. a must have for strategic awe.",9.3
"5 out of 5 stars. easily the best pc strategy game, even for being a few years old now. civ 5 is a legendary game that includes so many strategic decisions to be made. the multiplayer is always fun, and the singleplayer is not bad also. would recommend to anyone of any experience level with pc gaming.",597.5

"amazing game, but as some of the comments say.. never trust gandhi.",29.8

"just one more turn... completely losing track of time is a pretty strong indication of whether a game is good in my book, and civilization 5 may be the best by that metric. as a newbie to the civ series, managing a society through the ages had sounded a bit daunting, but thankfully the game is very intuitive for series beginners. the visuals, narration, and music are all pitch-perfect, evoking a grand ambience fit for a game about world conquest. individual games can take hours, but it never feels tedious or repetitive. computer opponents seem to have plenty of personality, and multiplayer with friends is a blast. i realize turn-based strategy games may not be for everyone, but it would be difficult for me to find someone i wouldnt recommend this game to.",63.8
"this is probably the best game ever, i reccomend this game. 10/10 potatos",90.8
"this game is amazing. when i first bought it, i played for 12 hours straight, crushing all enemies in my path. it has fantastic multiplayer. my only negative is that the games expansion packs are more expensive than they should be.",200.7
"really loved this game. the expansions gave it a more deep sense on how the world works. got into mastering the game in my little spare time i got and enjoying the close failures vs. the ai.",351.9
"this is one of the best games ever. you choose to gain allys, for enemies.",7.8
"i like the game a lot. it is very entertaining to me because i love seeing famous ancient people going to war, being my friend, or going to space. especially the older civs that got wiped out or changed to a different culture/name like the aztecs, its funny to see them go to space or shoot guns. overall, the game is a wonderful experience. i definetely got my moneys worth.",113.8
"good game. warning may cause you to not stop. 10/10",105.7
"very deep strategy game with complex systems to master. civ v has done a great job expanding on its concept and reimagining key features from past entries that have really brought this current rendition into the best the series has to offer to date.",9.9
"great game a lot of fun to play! very detailed graphics smooth game play. just good all around game.",827.4
"warning: will suck away countless hours of your life! civilization v is easily one of the best games ive ever played. i play it a whole lot, and even my sisters and my dad play it. its simply amazing. its a great game to take off some stress after work, school, or even after playing hours of rage-inducing shooters. grab a drink, pick your favorite world leader, and relax, while you conquer nations, and get nuked by gandhi.",54.4
"while civ v has been the subject of much criticism from the series long-time fans, dont let their silly words of anger distract you. the civ formula remains intact in this latest game, and many of civ ivs clunky elements (i never liked religion and espionage) have been removed. additionally, wars are now much more fun and tactical to fight thanks to the one-unit-per-tile restriction despite some glaring (but still relatively minor) flaws introduced by the concept. the only things i can name as negatives are the rather stripped-down multiplayer (which i dont play anyway) and ridiculous dlc prices. just forget about these, buy it, then set an alarm clock because you *will* lose track of time.",171.7
"this is a really fun game. i had only seen one civ game before (civilization revolution) and had only played it for a few hours and wasnt a huge fan of it. but this game is truly extroardinary. i didnt play turn-based strategy games before but know i do. definite buy. 12/10",9.6
"still addictive and a great way to waste an afternoon.",183.7
"far to many hours played on this game - always fun to play though",516.5
"civ v is a great game overall, i personally enjoy playing it in sp or with friends (chaseofhavoc). i think that some of the dlcs should be base game content (gods and kings). civ v has great versatility in playstyle given by its random spawn, random personality, game editor, and playing with friends. i would definatly reccomend this game.",168.4
"only have to say one bad thing about this game... the d.l.c. is waaaaaay too expensive.",35.5
"civ v is the quintessential time waster of a strategy game. i believe this is a good thing. this game allows your brain to focus on many different things, without feeling lost. the customization with what type of game you wish to play is phenominal. the dlc really adds to the experience. after your first game, youll be an expert thanks to the training system! go out and conqur the world +graphics +sound +gameplay +ease of use +tutorial -length (its an rts, what do you expect?) -online play",81.8

"i have always loved the civilization series but was a little apprehensive about the dramatic changes civ v was making to the series. however, after playing for several hundred hours i have come to love the changes. civ iv is a wonderful game and always will be but is probably the pinnacle of what could be achieved with the old civ gameplay (stackable units, etc.). civ v makes several changes that require you to play differently but introduce lots of new strategic options which brings new life to the series. i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves strategic games.",695.4
"this is way too good killer of time! spend like 10 hours to win 1 large map",31.9
"this is one of those games i always find myself coming back to year after year. who doesnt like to start up a game vs. the cpu or vs. a family member and imagine the world domination machinations of ghandi or george washington. the games can go on for awhile or just a day but it never stops being fun to take over the world whether your favorite victory is military, cultural or through overt capitalism.",192.1
"possibly the best in the series and ive played them all. wish i had more control over the interface layout, but its a huge improvement over iv.",77.5
"sid meiers civilization v is an amazing game in which you start off by selecting the leader of a country, you will play as that leader, each country has different attributes and units which help them start off the game, after selecting a world to play in you will spawn with a settler and a warrior, (may change depending on leader of choice). the warrior is there to protect your settler which you need to found your first city, a capital city. as you go through the game you find other world leaders, barberians and city-states, you will face war with all of them, diplomacy with two of them and everything inbetween. in the end civ v is one of the most entertaining games i have played in a long while and has massive replay value! 9/10",128.5

"so guys, this game is not just a standard strategy games, this game not like a game where you just need to expand your army and territory, this game is realy realy realistic if you want a empire builder simulator, not just army, you need to consider your people, dont let them starving, your diplomacy, city states, and the other..... if you are try play this game seriously, i think you need more than 15 hours to complete only 1 skirmish in realistic time (marathon in smc v). this game is very very addictive, trust me.",41.3
"ive been playing civilization games for many years and still have the original boxes too! i was very skeptical about moving from civ vi to civ v given the bad reviews out there at the time of purchase. after 3/4 years and all the expansions, ive found it to be a great addition. the ai still needs improvements and the multiplayer is horrendous but the game itself is super. i highly recommend the game and if you were to play it with other humans, then id say choose friends and via lan!",430.8

"i reallly enjoy this game because its complicated many ways to win, and you always have fun even when your new so i think you should play it",74.3
"this game is awesome. i played for a year thinking that i had all the expansions until i realized brave new world had come out a year earlier and it had snuck right past me. brave new world makes the game even more awesome. the game is so much fun, my only grip would be that the multiplayer is a bit laggy, and i wish i could own my own dedicated server for the game,",374.4
"good for hours of fun with yourself or friends dawg",64.1
"im conflicted with this game. its much easier to play multiplayer now with steam, but civ4 will always be my nostalgic favorite. cool new things (to c5): more in-package civs i like the hexagon grid as opposed to the squares city-states! a bit more stream-lined better graphics added in archeology, music, arts, and writting for culture policy trees pantheons and customizable religions things i miss (from c4): trading technologies trading maps (otherwise, whats the point?) the animated building of wonders upon completion using mods in multiplayer leonard nemoy baba yetu (song) founding multiple religions multiple units per-tile",227.9

"a nice strategy game, easy to get into and a smooth learning curve. next to ck2 and eu4 my personal favourite, it is just a bit too simple for me, bu the dlcs can make up for it. each dlc expands the game more and more, making it a deeper experience by the hour, the two best features for the dlcs were religions and steam workshop compability, the creators had some nice thoughts about things they didnt liked and either just buffed or nerfed things.",242.0

"score: 6/10 this game just didnt hold my interest. to me it lacked an interesting game world and story. it is pure mechanics and online play. if you want a single player experience, story, or an interesting world look someplace else. if on the other hand pure mechanics is fine then buy this game because the mechanics are rock solid.",7.1

"if you hate board games but seek that friendship destroying competition then this is the game for you. pair up with your favorite historical figure to make your friends hate you and to get that sense of superiority previously only found from stomping in monopoly. 10/10 i no longer have friends.",88.0
"this game is amazing! i like it very much, it has such good detail in the game and its very easy to learn. a great experience with friends.",39.2
"you know it is great when gandi can be the autocratic leader of facist india and can nuke the globe",36.9
"more casual than its predecessors, but also more fun and easier to get into. dont expect much in the way of online play as the servers are terrible, as a single player strategy game though its easy to lose days playing and not be bored. bretty gud.",32.5
"a great turn based strategy game, tons of different civlilizations to play. good depth and replaybility. can customize to have games long or short with different maps. supports multiplayer with frriends but i would recommend getting the brave new world expansion pack, adds trade routes, religion and much more. overall my favorite strategy game out of all the ones i played. get it!",309.2
"okay, ive got to be at college at 9am tomorrow, ill just have a quick game on civ before i go to bed. 2 hours later damn it ghandi! you will perish! 5 hours later ah , 3 hours sleep it is true story. happend to me the day i wrote this review.",53.4

"its so simple but intricate, its amazing.... if youre an rts guy/girl, get this game! also bnw is really good if anyone says it sucks theyre wrong",168.9
"this is the first civilization i played. previously, i thought it was just a boring turn based game. boy i was wrong. its like playing chess on a hexagonal map with lots of different units. in this game you can really win (or lose) because of your strategy. the first turns are quick, but as you approach the end of the game you have to consider lots of things, be careful and think ahead. excellent game. i dont have many dlcs and im ok without them. they may add some interesting variations, but you can totally play it without them!",49.4
"got nuked by ghandi, ending my 5-hour peaceful victory attempt. would recommend.",22.7
"very fun game. highly recommend to anybody interested in strategy games.",105.0
"the game with the two expansions (g&k + bnw) changes completely from the vanilla game originally released... it is a completely new experience. you have new units plus a lot of new features to try. the new ideologies, plus tourism and the related cultural victory is a great new addition really. i havent got any problems finishing the game first on marathon length on prince (no special ai bonuses). the only drawback i find is that without many bonuses, the ai has a hard time to keep up with the player after the industrial era (especially if you run for the artillery unit and start decimating the rest of the factions). higher difficulty levels give many different ai bonuses to balance the game (some people may not really like this because it is very easy to notice the ai bonuses, especially early in the game).",422.7
"awesome game, addicting. also fun to play with mods once and a while.",809.6
"great fun if you dont mind the drastic departure from the previous games in this series. ai players can be a bit wonky at times.",202.7
"this game is amazing it could not get ant better i heard there going to make a civ 6 cant wait!!!!",224.6
"great game. have been playing civ since the first one and this is certainly the best in the series. highly recommended!!",842.0
"civilization v is a fantastic game! i normally dont get excited or too interested in strategy games such as this, however civilization v captured my interest from the first time i discovered another civilization. a fantastic game and one that should not be missed.",20.7
"very good game!!! get a bunch of friends that all have mics and split up into teams!",96.8
"a classic game model and one that sid meier is king, i felt this game returned a bit of the magic that was lost in iv not yet tried the multiplayer but looking forward to giving it a try soon. its another one of those games to keep you up until the early hours with that just one more turn mindset. i especially enjoy the fast paced early years in game over the modern era but its fun to just overpower your enemies end game",72.6
"only play if avaliable to play for more than 10 hours, otherwise dont bother buying.",198.7
"when i first saw this game a few years ago, i would have never touched it. honestly, im playing it now. i love it. the re-playability is amazing. i do enjoy this game alot. i can see my self putting alot of time into this game.",34.1
"best game ever. be america and nuke the world, because if its worth doing, its worth overdoing!",279.5
"for people who like the feel of strategy board games, and the technological advancments of computer games, this is the game for you! sid meiers civilization v, along with its dlcs, runs and feels like a game like risk, making it very easy to follow and understand. i would highly recommend this game to anyone whos a fan of strategy games.",707.8
"civilaztion v takes some time to get used to, however once you do it is so much fun to play. the turn by turn play style allows you not to forget about certain areas or cities that need work. overall it is a fun game to play which for me takes a good long time to finish.",142.4
"this is basically the greatest strategy game ever.",409.9
"what you got here, is a fantastic turn based stratagy game. the civilizations to play are diverse in playstyle, from the warmongering aztec to the trade centric arabs. the gods and kings add-on brings even more to the table, with a massive game changer: religion. the brave new world add-on will revamp the culture system, and tweek current mechanics. get it and all the dlc that come with it.",661.5
"gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8. in seriousness though game is alright. i still miss a lot of things from civ 4, but poland is in this game.",10.7

"awesome game, very addictive, best played with friends.",199.4
"some good changes from 4 - no more doom stacks. some bad - happiness. overall more than adequate civ game.",89.9
"the game is perfect. i think it lives up to the expectations set by other civ games. if you like civ, buy it. though, i do think the dlcs a relativley over priced, the standalone game is good enough. i would suggest waiting to buy it on sale. i got mine with all the dlcs for like $13.75. overall score: 9/10",39.6
"a very strategic-based, turn-based war game... lots of different choices and ways to build your cities and armies, as well as allying with or seiging city-states and lots more too.",124.3
"fantastic game. love being able to dominate the world. :d",255.8
"very indepth and challenging lots of fun, a good way to pass the time.",218.6
"this is an excellent investment, if you enjoy single player turn based strategy games. its better than any previous civilization game, and the only thing it is lacking is playable multiplayer. the mulitplayer just takes far too long to play a game. its meant to be a single player game. its a deep and complex strategy game with a fun atmosphere. i will be playing it from time to time until the next civ game comes out. the only alternative to this that i would recommend as far as turn based is civilization revolution for consoles. its not nearly as deep but if you like multiplayer more than single, then you can play a game of civ rev in a reasonable amount of time for mulitplayer. this game is one of my top 5 favorite games.",141.6
"remove the ing barbarians, firaxis. i refuse to write any more until this is done. 8/10",245.6
"great game, if you have well over 100 hours to spare.",383.7
"i havent even finished a match, i just keep restarting because i have a fetish for the opening moves. 10/10 fulfills my niche desires",234.5
"you cant stack armies anymore but new features make this a great game.",73.5
"ive played them all (civ i through this one) and i like civ v the best *now* with the additional expansions. the hex-based map is much better for realistic environments and movement. single unit stacking is also much better - no more soak-off attacks (where you have a stack of spearmen with one modern armor and the enemy kills off your spearmen one at a time while your armor remains unharmed.) it also makes upgrading your military units important because now it matters if you are holding a mountain pass with a single legion versus using a rifleman unit. beyond combat there are a lot of nice additions with diplomacy, religion, and civics that give you more ways to play and win (replayability is very important to me.)",82.1
"press button make city, make buildings, create units, attack city, destroy city, capture city. repeat and win.",62.8

"kudos for providing linux version! your windows system is no longer supported. - fine by me :)",3.5
"i definitely reccomend this game for those of you who loves strategy game to your core. you will learn a lot from this game. starting with how to build your own population, how to maintain happiness in your civilization, how to achieve greatness by working together, and finally how to understand how human mind works! try it, or better yet buy it!",113.9

"playing rome in a multiplayer match and spawn next to two guys. one of them lose a settler to barbs and i take it for free worker both of them knew eachother so they decided i needed to die i completely destroy them until they spam the chat and rage quits 10/10 would defend against warriors and spearmen again",312.2
"civ 5 is a great buy for nearly any gamer, have had a ton of fun with it! 9/10",232.8
"this is definately the absolute greatest turn-based strategy game ever. i have been a fan since i first played civ iv and i could not wait for civ v, and i have to say that i was not dissapointed at all. the level of realism in the decision making aspects of the game is incredible and the graphics are phenomenol. if you are a fan of any genre of strategy game, i definately reccomend you getting this.",157.7
"at the time of writing this i have over 100 hours played. all i can say is that was 100 hours well spent.",120.0
"this game is absolutely amazing. incredible amount of replayability and extremely engaging. only down side is you can easily lose track of time while playing it.",892.3
"loved civilization iv so i expected a lot from this game and it has not failed me yet!",90.1
"definitely a must buy as it really worth the price you pay for. a game that uses strategy and planing in order to conquer or achieve a certain objective. isnt it everyone dream to take over the world or being the leader of an advance nation? well at least for me :). if single player is just not your thing, get a bunch of friends and start teaming up or backstabbing them in the back to gain control in multiplayer :) do remember is just a game though dont get serious when one bite your back haha. great game, for those who enjoy turn base and strategy game :) . it so interesting till you dont realize you have played it for hours haha",119.8
"this game is amazing once u get used to it youll get addicted to it",725.3
"after playing for awhile, not only did i find this fun and challenging but also addicting because you keep telling yourself just one more turn and the next thing you know youve been playing for hours. so yeah good game and also get the complete edition if you can.",9.1
"this has everything you need to conquer all of civilization and just have the best time being stabbed in the back then nuking your once allies. good memories...",470.9
"admittedly, it becomes same-y. admittedly, it becomes constrained after some time of your empire growing. and, admittedly, the ai isnt up to scratch. but the strategy that invades your purview on the higher settings sets you up for a realistic battle for conquerance. whether that be via war to win the world, victory in science, victory in diplomacy, victory in culture or standing the test of time, it does to great lengths introduce an abundance of components and options that really lack in some adversary total war titles (i know ill hold preference over this game from now on versus imperial glory: one of the games that got me into the pc platform in the first place). id recommend, especially more so as it grows on you as a pastime or interactive board game of sorts. but perhaps buy it in a steam sale, or whenever its on offer.",96.1
"outstanding game, it essentially goes to the begginning of human civilizations and you can deal with problems the way you want to. some mods are cool, some break the game. dlc are great as well and they dont break the game. in all, epic game.",398.9
"like always, the civilization series are all solid games, civ 5 does not dissaopoint",284.5
"gameplay/playability:9/10 art/graphics:6/10 story/lore: 7/10 multiplayer/coop: potentially 10/10 overall: pleasantly time consuming strategy game. extra: you get to choose your own civilization and start building it from the ground up in the ancient era. compete with other civilizations to grow into a superpower of the modern era. the way the game is scaled, one could easily find his or her self spending many hours in a single playthrough.",424.4
"took me a while to get use to the hex movement and the lack of stacking but this is an amazing game. by far the best 4x game i have played.",115.8
"for friends of turn-based stategy games very recommended. it wont get bored and is even for players with less experience and time.",1033.6
"when i started playing this game, i was a lowly, inexperienced lord to the japanese empire. now, i rule all the land with my good friend, constantinfinity. we might have clashing playstyles, but it all works out because im always right... and not a communist. all in all, excellent game.",128.4
"honestly one of the most addictive games ive ever playd, 10/10 :) with all the playable civs all i can ask for is more! :d",80.8

"be warned! you got salad in civ iv. 11/10 would salad again.",148.3
"this is way too good killer of time! spend like 10 hours to win 1 large map",31.9
"this game is great! a lot of people claim to like civ 4 better, but i kind of like 5. it is a little simpler to manage your empire, city-states are a great addition, and the new combat system requires a bit more skill (no more unit stacking). if you have played the older versions, youll love 5... and if you havent, i would probably recommend started with 5 over 4 :)",522.4

"why shooting zombies if you can play civ v and become a zombie urself?",123.1

"a lot of fun and a big time sink. it needs a clock in game so i stop playing until 6am.",26.9
"i have no doubts that this is the best tbs out there. very addictive, has plenty of replay ability, and gives you something fun to do on those boring, rainy days. and if your not a fan of buying dlcs, or just dont like the dlc for this game in general, you could always get community created in-game civilizations and mods for free. my only complaint is the bug which occurs sometimes when you get late into a game, that causes the whole thing to crash. as long as you save every 5-10 turns near the end of the game, you should be good :) 9/10",684.0
"great fun, very addictive, make sure you have plenty of time when playing this game as you will keep telling yourself just one more turn which can go on for hours before you realise. great fun on multiplayer as you attempt to out-do your friends economically or technologically or aid them against their enemies, or, even become their enemies.",208.9
"its great if you have a weekend with nothing else to do, doesnt require a lot of concentration so you can put real effort into trolling your opponants :d",300.0
"turn based tactics at its best. you got to reserve time to play this because games do not last 30 or 60 minutes, they can easily last for hours. its great to see your civilization prosper and how it stands the test of time. great to play with friends so let me know if you buy this game or want to play this game. one... more... turn...",298.7
"its good if you are up for a game that lasts for a while and constant initial lag when u rejoin later in the game.",130.8
"this has to be the most well balanced civilization yet, i have been playing since civ 3, its still a personal favorite of mine maybe because its from my childhood but regardless, this civilization is balanced it is much harder to conquer a city than in previous incarnations which is the way it should be! i also like the fact that cities dont instantly take to your empire. the amount of choices and ways to focus on winning the game are absolutely marvoulous.",125.8
"i like being that city that everyone loves. makes me feel like i...belong.",33.8
"this game is the best strategy game i have played ever! you should get it now!",503.2
"a whole lot better than the other civs ive played. but why they cant live up to their old game alpha centauri is beyond me. so im being unfair and judging it purely on that. and why is iron so much rarer than uranium? come on, game.",23.2

"graphically superior to any other turn based strategy game i know, civ v is my favorite platform for historical inaccuracies. you may not be much for strategy games, but nuking ghandi never gets old. i give it a 7.8/10 but with gods and kings i would give it a 9/10. i might also mention that the max graphics look like an oil painting...",181.9
"yes, yes, yes, yes, ... yes. if you are even just a little bit curious about this genre just try it. this game goes on sale often so if you dont want to pay the 30 dollar price tag because your not sure you can easily wait. although, in my opinion it is easily worth $100. you will lose your life with this game, you have been warned.",65.0
"one of the most fun games i have played in a long time, but be warned! you will get hooked like an addict on gaming crack, and there are so many mods that enhance the game, even when you feel like youre done with the standard campaign (and thats without even mentioning the awesome multiplayer) :d would definitely recommend! 10/10",242.0
"frustrating and exhilirating. it is, for better or worse, the epitome of just one more click.",577.3

"i founded new berlin right on top of where modern day edinburgh sits today. we built such wonders - the brandenberg gate (naturally), the leaning tower of pisa, big ben... we even built the great wall of china right across hadrians wall. people loved that city and came from miles around to marvel at its majesty. great men were born - rommel and alan turing, marching arm and arm across the rooftops of the world. at one point one of my famous playwrites even penned the fabulous wizard of oz. but then, just as we were on the cupse of the atomic age... the manhatten project poised to usher in a burning nuclear dawn over the south of england (and a unit of stone age archers id left forgotten down there), i was confusingly defeated by a random vote at the un which appointed my hapless opponent as world leader. game over.",157.5

"this is civilisation! intitally i couldnt get into the hex grid which was a departure from the earlier games. however after a while i barely noticed it. the expansions have only added to this. if you havent played this by now and it is your type of game then you need to own this.

"brilliant game. simple enough to be an introductory game for beginners and even non-gamers into strategy, yet complex enough to present a challenge and make each game interesting. my only complaint is that the game is very lacking in vanilla, and thus almost definitely requires at least gods and kings.",52.8
"absolutly beautiful version of the civ instalments. hands down my fav !",54.1
"i love this game, it is my go-to when i cannot decide what to play. the pace is as quick or as slow as you need it to be. you can play an intense round of world-domination, or you can go for a leisurely cultural victory inbetween errands and household chores. i wish i could say specifically what i like about this game, but it is a combination of little things that keep me coming back. i like the music, the way the ai rulers feel real, i like how i can easily play with my friends on steam. after a rough day, civ 5 gives me the chance to annihilate my enemies, in style.",439.7

"whether youre an old school civ guru or brand new to the series, like myself, civilization 5 delivers engaging gameplay through key choices made during every campaign. tread diplomacy lightly as to not incur the wrath of larger, more powerful civs, or go balls to the wall militarily. i guarantee if you play long enough, youll ache to win as many ways as you can. gods and kings didnt quite fix diplomacy, but the game is directly better because of the dlc.",477.9

"this game is surpisingly deep and it feels like its deceptively simple. theres more than one way to play the game and the brave new world dlc adds even more. totally worth checking out and theres a demo just to make sure you enjoy it. i have logged way too many hours onto this because it is way too damn addicting. one more turn,,,",45.4
"its a bit like chess. its very easy to learn what everything does and how you can use each building and unit, but doing anything actually meaningful with all those things over the course of an entire match will take you a lot of practice and learning. a single match can easily last around 10 hours, and alliances youve made (or broken) in the beginning of a game can have surprising effects on the end-game, although the ai sometimes makes this work a bit weird.",95.4
"do you like turn-based strategy games? if the answer is yes, then this is the game that you must play!",11.9
"time passes at an extremely fast pace in game, but it passes even faster in real life.",124.8

"this game is amazing!!! if youre not playing it you need to!",352.1
"this is not a game for everyone, its not fast paced at all and it can take some time to learn. but if you can enjoy a slow paced strategy game then this is the game for you, there is a lot too it and if you and a group of friends decide to sit down and play this for a day then you will probably have a pretty good time. id rate this a acquired taste out of 10, its not for everyone but if you can enjoy it then you will really enjoy it.",263.9
"i realy love civ v!!!!!!! i like the historical way they have it and all the countries makes me happy :d even sweden and denmark :dddddddddddd the culture is amazing with religions and stuff :p and you can name your own religion to make it special. the graphics are amasing but doesnt need hightech computers to play without lag :p you can play offline and online which makes the game fun with friends :d the animations when talking to a leader and when they talk on their own laungage is amazing. altough it had some problem (for example the modify glitch that they didnt remove in a long time) it was still awesome. but next time, dont make norway a part of denmark and finland a part of sweden :p 10/10 must play again",267.2
"friend introduced me to this game and have played 150 hours of it, crazy for this game and cant wait to get civ be and for civ vi",231.3
"this game is by far my favorite. if you dont know already, its a 4x where you control one of historys civilizations from the stone age all the way up to the near future. the main changes from 4 to 5 is the change of square spaces to hexagonal spaces for movement. also, this interation removes the stacking and limits you to one military unit and one civilian unit per hex, so no more stacks of doom. i dislike how in the base game they left out a lot of the features from previous games (such as espionage and religion); however, they add those features back in on the expansions. all in all, the game is addictive and hard to resist the just one more turn syndrome. i would give this a 9/10 with exapansions and a 7/10 with just the base game",453.1
"great strategy game, dare i say unparralled. the hex system is revolutionary and makes for a greater experience, especially in combat. the base game is great, but that said, i could never return to the base game after playing with the two gameplay expansions of gods and kings and brave new world. however, the base game allows for so many different experiences in itself, its still an amazing game on its own feet. the diplomacy is wonderful too, and the ai, especially as the difficulty is raised, react to every action taken by the player, whether it is a good-faith trade or the assembly of troops at the border. ive spent hours on end playing it and my only negative comment is that you cant play it if you have plans that night, because you will cancel those plans. enjoy.",402.0
"i like this game. the hexagon map takes getting used to. but you cant set up as huge armies as in the last civ.. it has a way better gameplay",91.4
"awesome game, i have fell in love since the early days!",127.4

"one of my all time favorite games! the only thing i could say would be something they really need to work on is the ai. the ai is very bland and often makes choices that dont make any sense.",626.8
"if you are the person who love to : 1. building your own dynasty/country 2. taking up your time thinking about the next move to make 3. have a creative imagination 4. have lotsa time to spend of course then i recommend u to play this game. although it really took a lot of time to learn and more time consuming to play, you have been warned !!",184.7

"this is the first of the civilization games that i played, and i can say that by far, i have not been disappointed with my purchase. this game is fantastic and great for anyone who loves games like it.",195.1
"this game is great. its a fun addicting way to waste time. it, however, does have some flaws. the a.i.s dont exactly act the way people would and lots of the later game units are really gimicky and unbalanced. luckily, they created expansions to the game to amend their past mistakes. its kind of a puss-out to make the dlc include civilizations instead of just releasing all of them with the game, but it makes up for it with new play styles, scenarios, and feel for the game. on its own, the game is a 6.5/10. with the dlc (especially brave new world), i becomes a 9.3/10. for any fan of the strategy genre, i highly recommend this game. have fun!",198.0
"america keeps cockblocking me whenever i build wonders. 10/10",139.5

"i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested in history and/or wants to learn about historical figures and events. this game allows the player decide the politics of the world you are in and that is why it is one of steams best selling games.",111.9

"simple enough for a newbie, yet complex enough for it to take weeks to master. i prefer originals to the sequels usually, but i can make an exception in this case... obviously!",217.9
"a very good strategic game but requires a lot of patience and time. gripping adventure to conquer nations in peaceful or war ways. a must have for strategic awe.",9.3
"always loved this game, but since i got gods and kings and brave new world the game got even better. telling yourself one last turn always ends in atleast 10 more turns. definatly a must have",407.9

"well, running it now on ubuntu 14.04 everything works phenomenal and its truly fast on my xmg a704. the vanilla game ist extremely replayable as any good civilization and its got this, one more turn, effect which will keep you playing for hours to no end, completely recommendable, i have not play any of the expansions/ dlc yet but they expand the game a lot it seems, and the price right now gives no place for error.",106.2
"very addicting, bnw expansion is great. dont trust ghandi.",164.4
"just one more turn.... civ 5 plus both expansions is the best civilization to date in my opinion. great user interface, best tactical combat of the series, fantastic looking graphics wise, and most importantly very fun and addicting. all eras now seem wonderfully fleshed out (thanks to the expansions) and the game now feels as complete as civ 4 did wth beyond the sword.",247.6
"a modern-day masterpiece. beautiful graphics, elegant gameplay, sleek interface, all wrapped in the glorious civilization building model that goes back to version 1 through 4. if there is a downside its that combat units cant stacked.",55.8

"this is the single most infuriating game i think ive ever played. it takes forever to accomplish anything, and trying to win in nearly impossible. that being said, the game is entirely too addicting, and once i start playing i cant bring myself to stop. i greatly reccomend this game, and think it could be enjoyable for anyone, despite their usual game genre.",45.5

"chose random leader for my first game of civ 5. rolled gandhi. set out to build a nice little empire. everyone was happy and well fed, cotton and whales were plentiful, and wonders were constructed to inspire my people. then montezuma showed up. he wanted my land, my people, my wonders... so i crushed him. his empire burned beneath the feet of my armies and his capital crumbled by their hands. but it would not stop there, my bloodlust would not be satisfied until every nation on the planet met their brutal demise. and meet it they did, one by one until the green of india spanned the globe... it remains the most true to form i have every played a civ leader. 10/10 would be  gandhi again",424.4

"civilization 5 is one of the first strategy games ive ever gotten into, that being said it has hooked into the entire strategy genre. the tutorial alone kept me playing for several hours, and youll always want to keep playing until you produce that unit or research that technology. along with the addicting gameplay there are some pretty nice visuals and multiplayer is pretty damn fun. all in all i recommend this game at any price along with all the dlc.",45.4
"while i havent logged much time in this game. i must say it was all in the course of a day. its absolutely mind numbing and addicting. must have!",70.7
"before this game i had never played any civilization game and i decided to try it as the gold edition was on a huge sale. im not disappointed the game is pretty fun, but if you dont have much time on your hands i dont recommend this game at all even a quick match can take several hours. there is no story mode the game only features online play with players with a choice of ai to fill empty slots and single player vs only ai. if you enjoy games like this i highly recommend this game.",115.3
"is a fun game if you want to spend a long time to play. if you enjoy management and strategy you will enjoy yourself. there are very little amount of bugs and glitches but the game can run slow if you have a poor coomputer. overall i would give this a 8.5 out of 10.",197.3

"ive spent more hours of my life than id care to admit enjoying the hell out of this game. its not just entertaining, its kind of educational and makes me feel like im accomplishing something. watching my little town grow and expand, and then kicking the butt of some poor mongolions...its like crack. the interface is easy, the tutorial was simple and once you get into it you can dig into the finer details of the game, and will likely enjoy every minute of it.",76.9

"addicting and takes hours of your life away. yet its totally worth it!",24.3
"the game is great to the experienced player in civilization franchise, but new player may find the game play confusing to play. the graphics on the game are visually stunning and the music is really immersive to the gameplay. the only drawback to the game is all the gameplay options. there are so many that i feel like im missing out on something. overall the game is a good pasttime when you are bored.",100.2

"how do i describe civilization 5? the short answer is that you cant. this is for one reason only. if i were to put this gaming expierence into words, it would ruin the game for many. this game has that x-factor that i look for in most games. where you can sit down, play and tell yourself oh look, its only 10pm. one more turn wont hurt. and before you know it, it is the dawn of a brand new day, and all you care is that next turn. this game never gets old because each game is entirely different, and i think that with all these things, 2k has put together a winner in civilization 5.",66.8
"game is great, new expacs make it great fun and adds alot of civs and its alot of fun playing on immortal and seeing ghandhi come and attack you with half a million nukes xd pros - game contains alot of fun and the modding community is great for keeping up the fun and adding new content cons - seeing missionaries and  inside your borders and not being able to attack them if you aint a  is really annoying. would 10/10 anyday.",401.5

"this game is one of my favourites of all time. having racked up plenty of game time, its clear, from my point of view, that the game is addicting and will chew through hours and hours of your free time once you start playing. 10/10, would buy.",459.6
"you thought you were going to do something today? nope.",132.7

"i have played civ 2 through civ 5 (including sid meiers alpha centauri). every version brought changes  good and bad things or things to get used to - and that is great! however, for the last years i tried but couldnt get at all into civ 5 plus its dlcs. to me, civ 5 is more like a mashup between a hex-based, strategic war game and a civ revolution console port than a deep empire building game. although very pretty and with some cool new features, it lacks soul, lost core civ concepts, and it keeps treating me like an idiot. it is disappointing because the potential is there but the foundation is too flawed. thankfully, civ 4 complete with mods such as caveman2cosmos will hold me over until, hopefully, a 64-bit spiritual successor comes along. :)",76.8

(with the brave new world expansion of course).",819.2

"veterans of the civilizations franchise may be immediately put off by the lack of features in this hexagonal iteration, but the expansions (gk+bnw) add a lot of content back and steam frequently has them for sale. to be honest the smaller scale of warfare due to 1-army-per-square and reduced warfare abilities in general as a result put me off at first. however, i really came to appreciate how much more significant country borders became as a result of this, making each expansion risky due to quick flanking maneuvers by the ai. i still think the ai for civ is still too predictable and even when set on random, a bit harsh depending on your difficulty level. still recommend the game for fans and newcomers, you will easily end up spending way more time than you thought carving your perfect civ.",132.1

"the ultimate strategy with a huge modding community in steam workshop, if thats your thing. although military victories are ht major type of its kind, the customisation of scenarios and world types are very impressive. leaders are also a great part of it, both historical and comical at the same time. one could describe it as a a chess game(due to hexagonal movements) with more then 2 players and 1000x the amount of complexity. yet the game is still extremely accessible and , well for me, easy to understand. despite this, i recommend to have some experience in strategy games, such as xcom or total war. but if not, there is no better time nor place to start then right here ,right now",123.6

"ah, civ v. kind of disapointing in the feature it lacked compared to iv, but has made itself up for that in the two main dlc so far. the first one got up to nearly par with iv and the second surpassed it. i also love the combat more by making unit groups more important than just stacking a bajillion units in one stack. mind you, you still needed artillery, but you get the idea. it is a much more interesting system when it involves more around units specifics. id suggest this to any 4x lover.",337.3
"great game that feels new every time you start it up. like minecraft, its vanilla and dlc content is just right, and allows for more complex features through modding. if you like diversity in your gameplay, the achievements can make you try something new. definitely recommended. tried to take the austrian city of salzburg with a 19th century armada, only to be obliterated by futuristic flying air ships. 10/10",345.0

"im not going to review this game because basically everyone i know has it. im still debating whether or not its better than civ 4. after giving it some thorough playthroughs, im giving the edge to civ v, with its sharper graphics, cities that dont get roflstomped by one guy, non do-or-die combat, more interesting civics, more interesting leader powers. i miss leonard nimoy and the built-in world builder option though, as well as some of the classical songs. :(",239.3

"fantastic game. been a while since i last played the series, i have fond memories still of colonization. last game now took me 23h to win a domination victory, had a blast along the way. it might be a bit easy though, and the replayability isnt what i thought it would be. there was also a few small things i would like to have had the option to enable and disable in the ui. i would however also liked to have seen more diplomatic and a more exciting research tree. but all in all it was a civ game, though simpler then i would have imagined. well worth playing, even if you have 4x space games and tropico 4 out there to compete.",57.1
"normally id start this review off by saying something like if youre into strategy games this is a must buy! but ironically i, myself, am not a big fan of strategy games, so i think it speaks volumes to the entertainment value of this game when i have logged over 600 hours into civ v yet dont identify myself as a lover of the turn based strategy genre. if you can grab this for a good price, its absolutely a must buy!",636.6
"wasted an entire weekend going to war with germany. only to screw my self over when they had thier one city left, it had a defence of 14 and i just wanted to nuke it. so i did. however in the process i would have had to declare war on india they too had one city left. figured ok i can take them....what i didnt ing see was the french and spanish subs with in thier waters next thing i know i have the spanards up my  with the french hitting me with baguettes while the germans retook thier land and the indias raining down an atomic storm that block out the sun because i was ing dead. ing fix this game... 10/10 will play this game once i get over this and reinstal thegame after i rage deleted it",518.4

"as you can probably tell, from the number of hours put into this game (550 at time of writing this), i enjoy this game. but then, i do like a good strategy game, and sid meier titles usually deliver on that. civ 5 takes the formula of the first 4 in the series and refines it into a sleek, glossy, next gen-feeling game; civ 4 all grown up, if you will. new civilizations available to play, a plethora of new gameplay and map generation options, a quality soundtrack, revamped multiplayer, and delicious visuals are just the icing on the proverbial cake. however, i do feel that the user mods dont always integrate as well as they should, and the absence of an integrated sdk (like civ 4 had) is lamentable. but hey, nothings perfect.",563.4

"theres very much that can be said about civilization v, but in short: it is certainly worth a purchase, but make sure you get the gold edition at least as its kinda empty without it. multiplayer can be pain to set up too, but apart from that its a game you could get lost in for days. hopefully we get even more dlc!",78.4
"fantastic game, just like the rest of the civilization series. very detailed gameplay and will keep you entertained for hours.",30.1
"love this game. at first it got boring after a few minutes of gameplay but upon learning the core of the gameplay and strategies, this is one addicting game.",277.5

"how to play against ai: 1. set up a match. 2. hope ghandi isnt on of the civs. 3. if he is, end him quickly or befriend him. 4. hope to god you dont get nuked by him late game.",73.5
"great game! has to be one of my favourite games of all time but i suppose thats obvious from the ridiculous play time. the two most recent dlcs; gods & kings and brave new world are a must have, the extra gameplay they implement is incredible.",644.8
"dont play this game. it will ruin your life. you will beg for one more turn and then, all your friends are gone. really.",169.9
"i loved catan so much that i pissed off friends trying to make them play. turns out i just wanted to play civ v. 10/10",46.6
"this is a great game to play by yourself or with friends. the whole concept of this game is good the gameplay is flawless you can spend countless hours raising an army or trying to get into space either way you will have loads of fun with so many different civs to choose from youll find yourself each time before you start a game taking a while to pick your civ. you can play this game one thousand times and have a different out come each time. the ais are very balanced and you can choose your difficulty to suit your needs. this game being 4 years old is still an amazing game 10/10.",161.9

"this is the best strategy game out there to date, 10/10 recommended",148.8
"the ability to win using different methods and to play with so many civilizations / options makes this game extremely replayable and addicting!",236.3
"positives: - an in depth strategy game. - fun with friends and by fun by yourself vs ai. - easy to learn and hard to master. negatives: - online matches are rarely finished due to the sheer length of a single game. - can become quite repetitive with certain strategies and skill trees being more powerful than others.",132.3

"civilization v is must have game for people who enjoy strategy games. this game has combinations that will fit any person playing style. the basic things for this game are easy to learn. as you learn the more advanced items, your style will form to it and allow you to us it to the best of your abilities. for those who really like the past cilization games, you will like this one as well. and dont forget about the expandes, they take the gameplay to a whole new level.",284.8
"i am really enjoying this game,and after i have spent more than 200 hours,i can say that this game is perfect for someone who likes to play historical/strategy games.scenarios are really great,which lets you start as civilizations on real locations in the world.this game gets 10/10 from me.",280.5
"wish they wouldve dropped the price for civ v in honor of the release of beyond earth instead of puting it as free to play for three days. otherwise, great game! would purchase if it was cheaper.",23.9
"very much recommended. can seem boring at first(especially if you arent familiar with the series earlier games), but once you get into it, theres no going back :d deep and addictive gameplay.",197.6
"after loosing complete faith in the civilization series when civ v vanilla was released, it was very pleasing indeed to give it another try after a brave new world expansion pack was released. just.....one....more...turn.... - oh how i have missed that feeling",360.0
"this is one of my favorite games of all time. its graphics and engaging gameplay provide hours of entertainment. i only wish that all of the content came with the initial purchase of the game, not from dlcs. overall, a good game.",138.8

"so much fun to play constantly has you thinking of what you should do next. 1 hour quickly turns to 3 or 4 whenever i play this.",25.1
"this game is worth the money. i bought it the first year it came out, but i constantly come back to play it after a while especially since im a history buff. every playthrough is different, even if you still use the same strategy everytime. i would definitely reccomend this game to anyone who loves strategy games, but i also think this game is a great starter for those who dont usually play strategy games and want to jump into them. 9/10",557.6
"there is a lot to this game and unless you care any bit for a strategy game i would not suggest this game to you. it can be fun, there are a lot of different modes and a ton of different choices in this game. it takes awhile to get to understand. there are tutorials to help you understand the game and get better at it but you can still play the game, not have any idea of what your doing, and still get somewhere in it. i would know ;o.",41.5
"damn, frikin shtty city-states are all like: oh! you better give us money or well end this friendship! dude, wtf you started the friendship jeeze but good game, just kill city-states as soon as you see them",34.7
"a game that revolutionizes turn-based stradegy games. adding new features never seen before in tbs like hexagonal tiles, which create new combat scenarios and make gameplay smoother, and the greatest dimplomatic choices seen in a stradegy. with many different civilizations to choose from and each one of them being unique with great abilities, like washingtons ability to have units see one tile ahead than normal units or caesers ability to have production 50%+ in the capital. multiplayer is great experience although setting up a match can be confusing to newcomers. games can last from 4-24 hours giving tons of gameplay oppurtunity. sid meiers civilization v is not only one of the most revolutionary turn based stradegy games, but one of the best.",59.7
"i joke its the best game ever made , and better than rome total war 2 ! must buy it",22.3
"all shall fall before glorious mother russia. also dont trust etheopia, that guy backstabbed me but its okay because i killed everyone in his kingdom with chariot archers.",9.1
"the game is fun, but there are so many bugs. half the times i try to install this game it just crashes after the intro movie. a google search reveals that this is a common problem but no fix has been found. waste of money when it only works half the time.",144.0
"great game with friends i would recommend though if you are going to playing multiplayer to get all the dlc it is really important a lot of small fixes that make multiplayer actually tons of fun just play one game of no dlc and play one with and you will see the difference is huge.",233.1
"the king of the 4x! especially with the expansions, this game is just great if you love your 4x. i personally prefer the absense of unit stacking (you can have 1 military unit, 1 civillian unit and 1 naval unit per square). cities have hp which means you dont need to stick your starting military unit on your city for x turns in case a random babarian captures it while you were exploring.",133.0
"im pretty terrible at this game apparently, but its still a lot of fun. just dont start playing unless you have appoximately 1 full day put aside for a campaign. its so hard to stop playing once you start.",117.8

"stragetdy game its quite nice but it takes alot of time and long time to play but its fun to play with ur friends!",25.7
"civ 5 is following the steady lineage of civ games. brave new world + gods&kings packs are quite worth it due to adding a ton of new capabilities. specialy in the brave new world the caravan tradings can make your day.",98.1
"this game is wonderful if you enjoy strategically taking over the world",104.2
"pretty fun with all the expansions. vanilla civ is meh",433.8
"one of the best games ive ever played. addictive, fun, and great with friends. just watch the clock, or youll find you spent 4 hours when you just wanted to play for five minutes.",208.7
"fun. takes a while though. you need a lot of patience to play this game, and dont expect to finish a match in one sitting.",28.3
"i have yet to be able to get into this game for real. every time i sit down to play it, im overcome with a wave of apathy towards it. even the gods and kings expansion doesnt save it. dont get me wrong, i like the hex tiles and i dont mind not being able to stack up units like crazy... i just think that as far as civ games go, this one is sub-par.",26.7

"ive been a fan of civilization all the way back to the first or second one. while my favorite one in the series still stands to be civilization colonization. this one stands true to the ways of civilization with adding even more if you get it on steam. the workshop aids it in its everlasting glory of timeless fun for all who play it. while the multiplayer can be glitchy and sometimes unreliable in the beginning of a game, or with people all across the u.s. (eu cannot play matches with the us on multiplayer unless you join through steam)i still recommend it in every situation although you may need to watch out if you dont like spending hours being drawn into one match. graphics: 8 (for a civ game) gameplay: 8 (10 with bnw) performance: 7.5 (took a hit in multiplayer because of connection, thats about it) overall: 8",148.2

"civ v is a solid game, but really needs the brave new world exansion. never before has an expansion so revitalised a game! the combat mechanics and victory conditions took a while to get used to coming from civ iv, but in the end are a very nice change, i do not miss the wars of who has the biggest unit stack?",174.3
"would recommend to anyone who likes the idea of rebuilding or building an empire.",242.0
"this game is great, but to get the full experience the brave new world expansion is a must have at this point. i have stacked almost 50 hours into the game and just now started playing on prince difficulty. ive had the most fun playing while drinking with some buds. 10/10",57.6
"another times with civilization. i have been play a lot of civ iv now its come to another level, new block model from squre to hexagon. its make tiles and river look really better, the zoom in-moving animals and troops. and the expansion with relogion and all other stuff. for me its another great game, and worth for 22.49 usd",67.1

"this is a great game. whether youre looking for a intense challenge, or just to unwind after work or school, this game will provide the experience you are looking for. i am not very good at strategy games, yet i have spent many hours enjoying the nuances of this game. the expansions add depth to the experience and there are many mods (my favorite being the song of ice and fire mod) which further add to the game. i would recommend this game to just about anyone.",390.9

"hello! i have done a few stupid reviews however i am going to do a real review so lets begin. so civilization v has many dlc packs however people will rush straight into brave new world but dont its a great dlc pack however you will miss alot that civilization v offers to begin with, i see many people only getting this to download modded players like winston curchill: with the united kingdom of great britian and northern irelan, or lenin with whatever the ussr stands for (sorry my patriotism is showing xd). but lets be honest you are missing out on alot of content which in evry enjoyable! so civilization v by itself is 8/10 but with brave new world is 10/10 for me!",74.6
"its a good game even though it uses the usual firaxis strategy (make an ok game then sell the dlcs that make it much better for almost full price, for example the new xcom) the only expansion you want is brave new world",0.9
"awesome game. full of history and interesting gameplay. tons of achievements, too.",9.8
"civilization v is a must buy for any turn-based strategy gamers out there. it allows you to grow a civilization of your choice through the ancient era all the way up to the information era, if you can survive until then that is. the vanilla game itself is decent but is lacking in some areas. i highly recommend buying the complete edition which includes two major dlcs; gods and kings and brave new world, with some other small civilization and map dlcs.",298.8

"everything in civ v is prettier than past versions. not saying that that is a good thing though. ive played well over 500 hours of civ iv. i cant really seeing myself play this that much. religion and espionage arent very intuitive nor is the defense of religion. the social policy trees are neat but feel almost too monty hall. in civ iv if you changed from one policy to another you lost its benefits. civ v you maintain all previously accomplished policies. moving a massive army across continents is slow and cumbersome and takes away from the game play. i still like the game, but this is not the civilization ive been playing since civ 2. update: january 5th, 2014. i havent played this game since i wrote this. i love this series, but this game just let me down so much.",62.6

"literally the best gaming experience for those with any appreciation for history. this game gives you the ability to rewrite the history of a new world, possesing an industrious nation state/classical empire of your choice. you have the ability to persue a victory in cultural supremacy, scientific achievement, diplomatic popularity, raw conquest, or a tally of points at the end of the year 2050 ad. every civilizations unique abilities, units, buildings, or tile improvements correlate accurately to history, and the way that civilization gained power in our world usually ends up its strong suit in the alternate multiverse created with each game of civilization 5. 10/10 by far worth anyones time.",510.5

"great turn-based game, spent way too kuch time playing this! good for quick games or long marathons! :d",48.5

"i was a civ virgin going into v and have to say it didnt matter one bit - the design of this game makes it a pleasure to play for hours and hours and hours on end. but it has got some dodgy ai especially if you choose to be more aggressive in your world building with enemies seemingly appearing from nowhere or having an unfair advantage. if youre interested in strategy and want an engaging and fun experience then try this!",46.7

"as someone who is no fan of the other civ games, i went into this with no expectations for enjoyment. i was so wrong! great game and with gods and brave new world it is fully featured to make even the critics enjoy it. just one warning. do not start a game at night, you will not be going to bed if you do!",93.3

"very fun! the game really sucks you in. its great for the type of game it is!",272.5
"by far one of the funnest games out there. i am not a big fan of domination by force. to me building a huge country into an economic and scientific power house. only help in wars against alliad city-states. producing over 1000 gold per turn you can influence anyone to fight your battles.",215.5

"i think this game is very good for new civ players",324.1

"this is a fantastic turn-based strategy game that will chew through your time like godzilla through tokyo. the screenshots may look like its a complex game, but its actually a very simple game with a lot of depth. the interface has been polished to such a degree that it keeps pulling you in. anyone willing to give this game 10 minutes of their time will find themselves looking at the clock at 4 am, blinking in disbelief and wondering where the time went (just... one... more... turn!) and the random world generator means that no two games will ever be alike. im not exaggerating when i say that this is one of the greatest games of all time.",504.3
"its good but you will end up playing it for like 15 hours straight",33.5

"just one more turn. youll find yourself saying this a lot while playing civilization. lots of fun to grow a civilization from nothing to a full empire. its amazing how deep this game can get when you get into it. a must for any turn based strategy fan, and even the ones who arent fan of the genre.",174.5
"a nice game, but i prefer civ 4 for several reasons: - diplomacy in civ 5 uninteresting; its too simple and doesnt play an integral part of the game. - there is a lot of places where micromanagement is beneficial (probably more places then in civ 4), but it is often hidden and has a cumbersome interface. one example is the assignment of tiles that a city works. even the prioritize production etc. choices dont always choose the best placements (f.ex. when building a settler). - combat is obviously very different, but also an interesting change, however a small map can become too crowded making movement almost impossible.",558.2

"this game is fun with expansions and well made but very poorly programmed, the multiplayer online barely works for anyone yet they do nothing to fix it, the game crashes often for everyone i know and has not improved that since its launch, and for many i know it will take anywhere from a minute and a half to even ten minute to even launch, often for many it will not launch at all yet the game still costs a good deal of money and does nothing to fix these problems. please go find another game, even the previous civ ran far better than this, this game is not worth your money, there are plenty of better options.",23.4
"i have bought every civilization game ever made, i love this game and i still do, but i dont appreciate loosing my option to play the game without being connected & being forced to do so while paying full price. this is in my opinion a betrayal by the franchise i have grow to love over the years. i will not purchase another game. though i think this is a fantastic platform it is not how i personally like to handle my business. i dont want anyone to know what im doing at any given moment if i choose not to tell them. this is my right to have privacy any i feel kinda violated.",129.3
"the addition of the hex grid map and the removal of stacking units makes planning military campaigns a much more interesting challenge. the addition of policies also makes this game very intriguing, as you can choose to build up your strengths or overcome your weaknesses. the civilizations are also much more defined in their play style, and having an ai that plays the civilizations as they were led makes for a much more memorable game.",202.5

"buy it. you wont regret it! hours of fun. never gets old with the workshop items.",59.4
"this will not be a review but instead im using this as a way to get the word out to all new civilization players in general. the game changer for me was misterciv5s channel. watching his series of tutorials is the best set of intructional videos for all levels civ v. yt search:  misterciv5 over the many years, ive played all genres of video games but never a turn base game. let alone one of the most complicated or highest learning curve required to play a civilization game. theres a reason why i avoided civ game in the last 10+ years. but in the age of youtube tutorials, ive tried to give civ another go.",74.0
"plenty of hours killed playing this game, worth the money with or without the sale",342.6
"11/0 would buy again. after saying that i truly enjoy this game its absolutly addicting, and even better with mods and friends. never trust ghandi",164.8
"love this game so much! love the entire series! been playing since civ iv. the combat system is so much better improved from civ iv, and it looks beautiful. anything could happen... will be looking forward to beyond earth!",190.8
"such an impressive game, it deserves more recognition",194.6
"you know when you go to a party and theres that one really good pie that youre just waiting to have and when it finally opens every runs for it and you fight your way through just to have one slice and you finally get to it and the biggest, best piece is left? yeah this game is that pie...its awesome",292.3
"i cant even count how many times i said id play a short game of civilization v and landed up staying up all night! its just that addicting.",47.6
"all my history lessons amount to nothing compared to what i have learnt in civ. rulers live for eternity with little or no challange by the people, often leading to the peoples death. ghandi is infact a warmongering dictator who enjoys watching your people suffer as his elephants destroy you fields and despite the advance in technology some of these immortal tyrants still chose to have a spear and stand outside of a mudhut when talking to you about research agreeements and trading oil. the most important thing to take from civ is that fact we dont have many years left on this world. the end of the world isnt 2012 but instead 2050.",115.5
"a great game and easy to get in to. just dont start on deity if you are new to the civ series. 10/10",142.2
"civilization v, or civilaztion 5. i dont know, just play it.",5.6
"you must have the dlc brave new world to enjoy this game at its maximum potential. vanilla civ is fun but wont last for long. 9/10 overall.",210.9
"this is one of the most addicting games ive ever had. a must own for any rts fan.",174.8
"yes yes yessssss! there is nothing like the satisfaction of dropping your first nuke in this game!",121.3
"couldnt get use to the hex grid instead of squares but seemd like a good game overall. i may give it another try.",3.0
"very fun game to play with friends. it is a very good trategy game. i went fropm civ revolution to civ 5 and it was an amazing transfer. although i did have to relearn everything about it. i would rate it 9/10, some gameplay mechanics on lower quality setting are a bit wierd and un playable with.",13.4
"for any new players to civ 5 here are some facts on gandhi 1. he is highly trustworthy 2. he will never betray you 3. in times of crisis, he will be there for you 4. he hate nukes, with a passion just some facts i thought you should know",114.3
"this game is amazing; it looks very realistic and you can change almost everything to make one game (e.g. make the map size up to huge). also its online and this game is perfect for online. it also supports mods which means it si easier to mod it. by modding u can add all kinds of things to the game (e.g.different units like wookie units)",117.9
"best game ive played in 10 years! extremely addictive. beware, you will have no life after you play this!!",169.0
"vanilla civ was a good game, but each additional layer has made meaningful improvements and added delightful depth leading to a full version that is a great game.",793.4
"i loved civ 4 but the improvements to this one make it even better, i would recommend this to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.",51.1
"this game is addictive. it is also amazing. if you dont have it, and like games like this, then why ?",474.7
"average time spent per login: 500 minutes straight buy this .",542.4
"imagine being locked in a room with big gaz g, and razza, while m.r. west films it all. this is the opposite of that situation.",243.6
"both really easy to get into, and very deep. while it can take a lot of your time, its worth it.",123.9
"if you dont buy this game you should probs uninstall steam you massive ing",367.7
"really fun game for war strategy and on top of that it gives alot of interesting facts from that time",79.3
"this game is the best strategy game i have ever played, i truly think it is a great game to get have fun!",62.8
"by far the most detailed game in comparison with other sid meiers civilization games. if you do not mind killing time for 4-5 hours per game then you will love this game. not only does the game introduce new mechanics, but it also allows the players to play a leader throughout time and change the fate of history... forever!",660.2
"i cant explain it. you open the game...and then you look at the clock and youve somehow lost track of the last 6 hours. any game that can engross you that much is a definite recommendation! a definite must-have for any 4x strategy game fan!!",13.7
"an addicting, turn-based game that will make the time fly as you build you empire from the ancient age to post-information age! nearly infinite replayability as mods, random continents, and nearly 50 different nations ensure a different game every time its played will you build a space ship? or coquer the world? trade and commerce? or found a utopia!",217.1
"best game ever made, no need for a detailed review, but it now 99999/10",15.8
"theres nothing you can do... start playing, and youll end up knowing only one sentence: one more turn. nuff said.",15.3
"this game combines the beautiful playstyle of the other civ games with outstanding dlc and an amazing aray of diversity in a game which at first glance can be repetative, no matter how many campaigns (or whatever you want to call them) this game never gets boring. 8/10",68.4
"great game, i will invariably spend hours on this game in the future with my mates.",176.2
"dear college students... dont! ... or prepeare to see your time vanish",352.6
"cant.. must have.. need.. iron.. trade me ghandi this game takes your life and makes you feel proud to be a gamer!",127.5
"just one more turn... just one more turn... just one more turn... just one more turn... just one more turn... just one more turn... just one more turn... and then you win, and have gone 3 days without eating or sleeping.",41.4
"one time i peed in someones pool while standing on the outside of it. good game.",104.8
"fun offline game with unlimited gameplay oppurtunities.",98.1
"the only thing bad about this game is how long it takes to play and the lack of any form of a stopping point. you can spend hours sitting their thinking ill get off right after i conquer the greeks. suddenly you look up and you realize you started playing 5 hours ago.",313.4
"the previous games of the civilization franchise are some of the better games available on pcs, and this latest iteration is no different. in concept, its no different from the previous four games but some new additions - including a significant revamping of the combat model - and excellent graphics make civ5 worth a look. but beware; it is as addictive as ever and every time i play i end up going for just one more turn into the wee hours of the morning.",62.1
"great game, i was a bit sceptical of the new layout with the different paragons from civ: iv, but i have since grown accustomed to the hexagons instead of plain squares. the game itself is awesome, with both the leader/civ traits and the special units, you have a lot of different road to head down with your civ. you can choose to go all out agressive if you have strong earlygame units or are a good diplomat with the citystates. there isnt two games that are alike. the map changes, the opposing ai does, and the attitude of nearby city states (whom you either please or ignore) makes the game feel like a new experience each game",136.9
"one of the greatest games i have ever played it just never stops surprising me.",230.9
"this game isnt working for me on windows 8.1. i bought the complete edition",8.7
"one of the best strategy, turn-based games ive played in a long time. conqour the world or win the hearts or awe of millions, you choose how you want to win this thing. the entire set-up works great because sometimes you have to rely on your enemies to get the job done, whatever it is that your doing. this is just for the base game alone; when you take into account gods and kings expansion, holy crap, this thing is the best ever. espionage and religion (only in gods and kings) add such an addictive game mechanic, youll never stop playing this. every single turn is a please...just one more turn then im done... crawl to the finish line, even if youve already gotten there.",64.7
"an awesome strategy game to play with friends or by yourself. either way youll say im getting off after the next turn but youll still be playing for 100 more. great game cant wait for the next installment!",105.6
"epic. i love how this game really makes you think. great game to play while tripping.",178.8
"great game that sucks you in for hours at a time. i can never sit down for less than an hour without craving more. some would compare to meth, but a tad bit safer. 9.5/10",182.9
"ever wanted to change the corse of history? nows your chance!",303.7
"the best strategy game i have ever played and by far the most addicting, if you are willing to sit down for a few hours, this game is amazing.",134.9
"200 hours in and i still keep coming back. the base game is decent, but the real fun is with the gods and kings and brave new world expansion packs.",307.1
"fun game learning curve but fun with lots of friends and baes",32.1
"hours of fun had with this game, been online playing with my buddies nearly every night for weeks now, the ai is abit warmongery if youre not careful though!",153.7
"hands down on of the most effective turn-based games ive played in a long time. only downside is in large player matches...fighting against other people eats up a serious amount of time.",262.4
"its epic luv it and its best strategy game eveer 2nd is clash of clans",9.5
"i recommend this game only is you like strategy games. otherwise you may find it a tad too boring (for lack of a better word). i personally love this game simply because of how time consuming it is. one game can takes hours even days to complete solo; great for making time fly by. when i first got the game, i never really played it that much. but when i started to get back into it, i was so addicted to the game. i would play it hours on end. if you did this too, you may even want to invest in its gold upgrade which includes all dlc (except brave new world of course). brave new world would top off your civilization v gaming experience if you are willing to pay for it.",142.2
"this game is godlike. it is beautiful and wonderful. even the vanilla version makes oyu want to just stay for 12 hours and play. i highly recommending waiting for a sale for the complete version but i still got bnw and it is awesome. love the game and its mods make it more exciting. 5 out of 5. a perfect game.",383.5
"i want the badge for this but the game is still one of the best ive ever played. if you have hours and hours to devote to dominating or peacefully creating the best civilization ever and raising yourself to the top of the metaphorical food chain this is the game for you.",49.7
"very fun game to play, racked many hours on solo and on multiplayer. would definitely recommend this game to anyone :d",114.4
"do you like turn-based strategy games? if the answer is yes, then this is the game that you must play!",11.9
"yup, lost many hours with this game! will be losing many more, too.",207.5
"most fun when played collaboratively with friends. good luck keeping track of what the hell you were planning in the half-dozen youll have going at once, based on whos available a particular night.",69.3
"i bought the vanilla version of this game about a week ago, and it has sucked every other aspect of my life up. im constantly thinking what new civ to play as, or who im going to wage war against next. the stategy is wholly absosrbing, and i would recommend this game to anyone. not just 4x or strategy players, but anyone at all. i havent even mentioned the expansions yet. apologise in advance to your family, you wont be seeing them for a while. 10/10",292.0
"most awesome strategy game ive ever played! worth a buy =d",22.6
"if you like turn-based strategy games, this is what you should play! buy it play it!",123.1
"this the best way for killing time!! time flies away every time i play this game. the environment is detail and colorful. and one i like so much is we can achieve victory with multiple ways. whether is with war & domination, with culture expansion, or diplomatic approach. we can embargo one nation and see it crumbles by itself. or we can just send the atomic bomb right away in the enemys capital. with the lastest expansion, we can even spread our religion worldwide and gain influence in world council (uno-like). very recommended!!",131.8
"i spent so many nights playing for just one more turn. this is easily one of my favorite versions of civ.",125.0
"one unit per hex, combined with the fact that a nations capital has the same size as a company of archers makes for unintuitive cringe-worthy gameplay. on the plus side it looks good enough to make civ iv annoying to play.",13.0
"by far one of the only civilizations that ive consistantly played since i bought it.",129.2
"if you have many hours to waste killing other factions and being a ruthless  then this is the game for you :d i love it to pieces, the design is nice and the ai is smart even though they can occasionaly randomly denounce you for nay good reason <3 love this game 8/10",106.7
"been a fan of civilization since civilization ii, so the fact that i like this doesnt come as a surprise. i will say that i do miss some of the things that were taken out of the games as they progressed through the series (building your throne room was always something i enjoyed), but i can definitely understand why they changed things. all in all, if you like to sit down and play a game, and, lose your whole night then this is the game for you.",56.4
"one of the best strategy games of all times, and the most customizable with the support of a massive player community. see the light from yon window? thats the coming dawn. i hope you dont have work this morning. ;>",1048.4
"the game is great but steam will not open after a year, be careful. it requires an internet connection to keep verification, but steam does not have a phone number for service. when you ask it a question it gives you only a faq response. not helpful.",281.4
"gam is fun, wold reccomind this 2 ppeople out ther. -suggestionz: kim jong-un dlc : adolph hilter dlc if u c dis, show 2 gayben, plis. this gaem is r8 8/8 m8 (i mastrb8)",31.4
"lost 2 girlfriends from playing this game 10/10 would ave true to caesar again",202.2
"great game, always adding new expansions and new dlcs. vanilla is complete garbage, please get gold edition or gold edition upgrade.",527.8
"the pringles of gaming... dont start playing if you have any plans for the next 10 hours!",293.8
"i love this game so much, it has a steep laerning curve, but once past it is is amazing. there are so many routes to take to win, and how to get there! i just simply love it!",170.5
"one of the best strategy games i have ever played. dlc makes it even better but still great without",210.5
"one of the best strategy games to play with you friends!! try to win trough military, science or diplomatic viktory and some outhers as well.",249.4
"civilization v is a fantastic example of a turn-based strategy game, in this game you get to play as one of a large selection of civilizations and take them to greatness or death, they are in your command. this game has streamlined ui, great ai and amazing replayability. if you like turn-based strategy games or games that you run countries then buy this game!",92.5
"you will lose at least a week of your life playing this. one game takes about 2-8 hours depending on how you set it up. its fun, in a way i cant explain. just try it out and be sure to get the dlcs as they make the game better.",181.6
"civ v is a must have for anyone who enjoys strategy games. its especially fun with others, whether its a friend, a big group of friends, or just random people. the dlcs are honestly worth the extra money.",234.7
"oh god yes they fixed the multiplayer so it actually works. 10/10 would waste 7 hours in one sitting with.",37.2
"a great game that you can spend hours just playing through one match and end up getting rocked by another civilization. watch out for ghandi especially because he is a sneaky one. i would suggest at some point in time in trying out the game difficulty diety because it is quite the challenge. i never played a civ game until recently and have enjoyed everything about the game and expansions of the game. a casual strategy game that can get intense at any moment.",1038.9
"this is my first time playing a game in this series, and i throughly enjoy it. its great fun to play alone, but it shines when you play with and against your friends in multiplayer! it does take some time to get used to how it works, however there are many strategies at your disposal. i would suggest this to strategy game players, but it can be fun for others as well. a well-made enjoyable game! great game!",94.4
"civ v is a slow-paced strategy game that has nearly infinite replayability. its even more fun if youre a history buff. ive played it vanilla, with the g&k expansion, and now with bnw, and these two expansions improve it significantly. i wouldnt recommend starting it up without at least g&k, its just a tad too barren without it, and religion is a really fun mechanism. dont be thrown by the initial complexity- civ is a game that will reward your attempts to figure it out.",343.2
"if you want to see the out side world... dont play this game, never.",35.3
"addictive like you wouldt believe ! im affraid of booting this game and stay stuck in front of my computer all night when i have to go to work the next morning ! be sure to pick it up if you are remotely interested in strategy games ! 9/10",44.0
"great game. another wonderful addition to an amazing series. i would highly reccommend it.",59.1
"i believe with enough friends, an online match would be amazing",124.2
"great game! until the b-hole barbarians show up to raze your city. but other than that a lot of fun.",65.2
"so mnay hundreds of hours, greatest game in all history up to its own time",406.0
"if you are thinking of getting a strategy game for this sale, go with this. i would also recommend buying the standerd version then bnw cause bnw includes g and k and adds more too, so its just more bang for your buck. if u do get it msg me so we can play!",294.7
"this is one of the great turn based rts that i ever played with. owning this game will never make you regrets because the every game you start there is a different situations that you might encounter and always not predictable specially if you are playing deity with 12 or more civiulizations to compete. the only thing that makes my game hard to finish is to win science victory in deity level. its very hard and awesome. 9/10",38.8
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",316.9
"countless of hours spent on this game, one more turn untill you fall over your pc. worth the money. and its a game you will always come back to to play a round of. i remember when i just got it, belive i did a all nighter. :)",341.7
"time consuming political game, is what it comes down to. like a turn-based ages of empires but with intelligent political ais. played it for over 40 hours in 3 days of getting the game.",67.4
"if you want a time based, historical, and fun game, civ 5 is the game. with civilizations that have and atemped to stand the test of time, you can rewrite history and bring a new era of destruction and peace. play as many civs such as incas in gods in king and many more in bnw. i advice you to buy this with hopes you can enjoy it. i love it and i hope you all do to",530.6
"absoutly love this game. it has a playstyle that will keep you hooked for hours just wanting one more turn. if you have got 8 hours to kill i reccomend sitting down and playing this game.",141.9
"i recommand this game for anyone really but especially europe board game players and stratagy",96.1
"not only one of the best 4x or strategy games ive played, but it tops the charts as one of the most enjoyable times ive had playing a video game. the multiplayer can get a little glitchy sometimes, but is worth it nonetheless. ive gotten in some heated political arguments with my friends while immersed in civ 5, which were some of the most unique experiences ive had on a pc game. the single player ai is also very unique, as each country has their own personalities. all around a great game.",108.4
"a game intricate enough to make me not desperate to win it. the game play is fun enough on its own, without the added joy of beating someone.",49.6
"quite literally the best game i have ever played. hours upon hours of replayablity, and an amazing turn based system of play. i havent even bought the brave new world or gods and kings dlc packs, and i still find myself going back to this game when i need something to do. 10/10",283.5
"continues the civ tradition of being dangerously addictive. fantastic game.",17.4
"its an amazing game its just so fun to play as one of the nations that exsited in the worlds history and play it over in your own way. it is well improved from civilization iv in a lot of ways. i defenetly recommand this game.",262.3
"easy to learn, but hard to master. this game is easily the best turn based strategy game to this day. with many steam sales putting civ on sale (due to it being slightly old), it makes it an even easier purchase. with capability with the workshop and plenty of dlcs, you cant really run out of things to do.",88.6
"great game! graphics are like crysis 1-2, but it gets the job done. and the gameplay is amazing, unique parkour combat with cool upgrades and weapons. best of all, it doesnt force you to buy stuff with real world money, so you can enjoy it for free.",32.8
"good game with plenty of gameplay options and replayability. only downside for me is the expansions are a bit pricy at this point. i mean the game itself is the same price as both major expansions. its a bit much. but over-all it is definately worth a play if you are fan of the series or if you enjoy turn-based strategy.",102.8
"a great exploration strategy game. similar to age of empires. must buy!",14.4
"addicting. ... like its predecessors... a game to spend the whole day saying , just one more turn ...how i missed my civ marathons ^^ !",187.8
"a great strategy game. its different enough from age of empires to make it a unique and refreshing take on this style of game. youll wonder where the hours went after playing a session of this. there are multiple ways to win and hundreds of moves to be made. if you fire up a game today, dont expect to get anything else done until tomorrow.",32.5
"rule the world through dipolma.... wait a second. i can build nukes? nukes. and ghandi. and kicking the crap out of people who wont give you wine. 10/10",65.4
"this game has taught me one thing; if ghandi cant peacefully protest, hell initiate thermonucleur war. 10/10 for murderous ghandi.",92.0
"if youre looking for a game that will make you think, strategize, and adapt, youve found it. civilization 5 is easily one of the best strategy games ive ever played, and it never seems to get old. no two sessions are alike, especially if you choose to play multiplayer. the game is already fun and immersive, but when playing with a friend or two, whether youre progressing together, or fighting for superiority, the entertainment value doubles. if you enjoy turn based strategy games, give this a try; it has unlimited replayability, and i guarantee youll enjoy it. also you can nuke stuff. buy it.",101.4
"this is an addicting game, i definitely recommend it.",137.4
"a great gae of estrategy, kinda slow, but pretty good, if you like the strategy games of turns, and mltiplayer, then u should buy it, and if ur friends already have it, even better, as its a bit boring playing in solo if you play it online, play it without the animations of battle and movement, it will be a lot faster and less clumsy",48.1
"great game, really addicting. like a lays chip, you cant have just one. in this case that one is a turn",164.6
"i have played this game for 17 days straight. i have loved this game so darn much, that i have made countless youtube videos on it. i recommend this game like no other. get it. nuff said -wise poet 1872",76.8
"buggy game at the start but after patches and 2 expansions it is fun to play",171.6
