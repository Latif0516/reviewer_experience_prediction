"it was one the best fps games back in a days.. would go back in time when this game was still popular 10/10",24.7
"death is a great teacher. failure in counter-strike is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldnt have done, and how you could have done better. counter-strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.",258.4

"basically this game was released back in the year 2000 and still is one of the most played games on steam. so clearly it must be good because so many are still playing it. i definitely recommend this game and if you dont like to shoot terrorist or counter terrorists you can always try different game modes like zombie modes. 10/10",80.9

"blame this game for the rise of the online multiplayer modern military shooter. good game, great custom maps, terrible community. not much has really changed since 2000, has it? i dont think anyone still plays this particular version of cs though. edit: wait, there are over 8,000 people in-game right now. wow... guess i have to give this a yes then because it isnt dead.",153.7
"standard run and gun game that says it tries to stop cheaters and hackers out of the game, instead all it does is ban people who are having internet trouble trying to blame them for lag switching. it does not hitting those who you can obviously watch and see they are using aim bots by spectating after death and always aiming at people through walls at their heads ready to shoot the moment they turn corners.",0.6
"it is a very good, classic game, which started the multiplayer shooter game series of counter strike.",622.0
"if you cant get counter-strike: global offensive, this is great replacement for it. its not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. some servers may be in languages you cant understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. one of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. although the games graphics...arent really the best. even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. though to me, graphics dont really matter. highly recommend this game. 9.5/10",11.3
"when youre a counter terrorist you shoot those bad terrorist and stop them from planting evil bombs in america,",39.6

"played this game for the first time in 2008. since then i have clocked more than 5000 hours, thats how addictive its multiplayer is. father of all fps in mp. plus has several mods deathmatch, hns, kz, gungame, scrim, zombiemod and paintball. its been 14 years and the game is still going strong atleast in the indian scene.",1941.2
"game which dragged me in gaming, as outdated and old it is, the best memories for me lies within this game. i mainly played because of mods, which were great, like zombie mod, death run and wc3ft mod",1277.4
"the time that your head was the size of a pillow :d",20.5
"i got banned from this game in 2002 by vac just because i logged in from a computer with hacks installed in a lan shop. it has been 11 years since i was banned and i still cant play counterstrike with my account. i am already 25 this year, even prisoners in democratic nations are given 2nd chance but not steam. shameful!",0.4

"this game is a classic master piece. and has amazing replay value. as a young gamer my self growing up in a world where most casual gamers are xbox humping, cod playing, graphic s. it is shameful that this game is not played. this game made and broke friendships and made a childhood for many people. even if you dont play the game often. please just get it for it to be in your library. 8/10 for some bugs and a now strange community. but nonetheless a great game.",45.9

"the greatest multiplayer shooter experience ive had since quake 1. the e-sport scene also helped it alot, its the only computer game ive really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when i followed the cpl etc). the design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. the call of duty and battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like counter-strike.",477.4

"one of the best shooter games ever ! you must buy it !",461.5
"you have this game to thank for modes like call of dutys search and destroy. cs is arguably the most widely-played online shooter of all time, and its still got a thriving community going on 12 years later. its got simple, easy-to-pick-up gameplay thats spawned a massive competitive community. unfortunately, its extremely stale thanks to the fact that there are 3 game modes. luckily, there are tons of customization options available online. still, worth checking out for the sake of history.",0.3
"this game ruined my life. its an awesome title! i never knew a game 14 years old would be so good and still, its active in the community! thats really nice! this game is a huge hit in the market and still there are lots of buyers. it is a little thought for a guy like me who just plays non fps games. but still, it is really interesting and amazing to play with friends and online too!",7.5
"i remember being a younger kid, i had a brother take me out and walk for about 30 minutes to a gaming cafe where they have this game being played 90% of all computers. playing this for the first time as a kid, i felt it was so realistic lol. it was like being in a new world, basically. we came back to gaming cafe every once a while whenever we can afford it. one time, my dad came home early and we were not home, lol. somehow, he figured out where we were at! good times good times! this is one of few games that made my childhood memories.",0.5
"as a cs fan i do like tis game. but i dont have that madness it to the game as many other do. that could be because i grew up with cs:s. so i feel like you guys do, just not to the same game. but i mean this game was the start of the cs history so this game needs love! :3",280.3
"cs.16 its a good strategy onling game and i suggest you to buy it ! beacause cs.16 have a lot of skills and mods too,like (deathrun,jailbreak)etc.!!!!!!!!!!! maybe have not good graphics cause cs1.6 since 1999 but its the most popular game in the world..! so thank you to read my review!",294.2

"endless fun i could end up with over 1000000 hours on this game xd. everyone sucks at first because with this game its all about practice and trying things out, seeing what weapons you are good with etc etc. anyone can be good at this game its all about how much time you put into it as long as you have some very basic fps know-how you could master it for sure.",24.5
