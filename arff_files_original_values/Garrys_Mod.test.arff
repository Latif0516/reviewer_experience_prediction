"only reason i needed to get steam, time wasted in game 18 days and counting...",515.8
"to me, this is one of the best online multiplayer games here on steam. its great for offline, as long as you have some addons but its even better when playing with your good friends on a server were you can muck around, make someone laugh, and maybe even make some new friends. this game is worth the money spent and is worth the time it takes to get used to it.",265.7
"if you dont have this game, you must download it just to be somewhat successful on steam! i love gmod!!",19.3
"fun game. full of addons, i like it. 10/10. buy it !",87.4
"before you rate this review down, please read it. the major concern i have about this game is the fact that what youre paying for is the hl2 content. everything has to be downloaded. that is not something you pay 8 euros for. thats something you pay 0,99 euros for. everything is hl2 editing but with a lesser developer manner. youre doing the exact same thing you can do in hl2 - but easier and more sophisticated.",13.7
"garrys mod has lots of things in it. first of all, the gamemodes are awesome. there is darkrp, trouble in terrorist town, and many more. i recommend you play this awesome game. you can build, fight, and party all the time. my most favorite thing in this game is the add-ons from the workshop,",247.2
"a game with unlimited possibilitys. this game has no end.",438.4
"cool sanbox game with tons of addons and lua errors to explore ofc i am good at it lol :melon: is needed for it i use my :physgun: to build things without :missing: if u got css",1440.8

"when i open up the menu it doesnt show models for tf2",29.1
"warning, if you buy this game prepare to let your social life go to the sh*tter. trust me its worth it though. the community overall is warm and welcoming but can be unsociable to a degree. love it. live it. :)",1541.8
"the best game worth every dollar will never forget this game",796.4
"wasted 200 hours of this game. will not be able to get those 200 hours back edit: since people dont know sarcasm. this game is amazing",225.2
"real good time waster, lots of games, its just fun to play",49.3
"i dont really know where to begin with gmod. at its core, its nothing more than a sandbox to play in, no goals or points or leveling up. just a gravity gun and an arsenal of crazy crap to spawn in. the interface feels a bit clunky to me, it took a while to learn even the most basic menu navigation keys, but once you get the hang of how to work your way around, youll realize that the user generated content for this game is astronomical both in quality and quantity. i absolutely love trouble in terrorist town and prop hunters. id reccoment picking up garrys mod just for those two game modes :d",11.8

"this is an awesome amazing game with infinite possibilityies. i reccomend this game to everyone!! it is a great sandbox community game! just get it!!",240.9
"this is an extremely fun sandbox with no limits as to what you can do with it. its various mods go anywhere from giant theatre for sharing your favorite youtube videos, competitions for building the best boat, fortwars, space environment building and roleplaying, and many more awesome mods.garrys mod is basically google sketch-up running on a source engine. you can mount almost all of your source games, and create things to share on the steam workshop.garrys mod is a cheap, fun and enjoyable experience.",3.3
"really fun game to play with friends , cuz u can do anything you like and ever wanted it is cheap but if you dont have internet the game will be boring to play alone.",391.1

"the game is terrible... nothing to do, everyone is hostile, its filled with people that scream like a little girl i recomend getting this game",91.7
"like many others, this is the game that inspired me to get a steam account. no matter what you like to do, gmod has it. best played with orange box content enabled (which requires you to have the orange box)",618.3

"its fun at first but after a while it loses its charm. i had fun for like the first five ours or so, but then there just wasnt enought cool stuff to do. if you have money and dont want to save it for a fun game buy this one. yea it will be fun for a bit, but after a few hours or so youll lose interest and itll be the game that will be uninstalled but still in youre library.",19.8

"cool game! i really love the fact of sandbox games that are also other gamemodes too!",195.7
"for a meager price of $10, you get an experience like no other. a source engine mod, that allows you to do whatever youd like. any kind of gamemode you can imagine, you can create. if lua scripting isnt your forte, take a look at the workshop, and see what other people have made, as far as gamemodes, maps, playermodels, and props. endless fun, especially with friends.",476.5
"okay.. name me one other game that can do half the crazy stuff this game can! name me one! name a game where you can take a renamon, nail it to a barrel, turn the barrel into an improvised nasa reject, and launch it into the sky, and then make it explode with a gun from half life 2. you cant, cant you? garrys mod is ultimately 23,000 games in one, and all you need is a couple old source games lying around on your hard drive. simple, isnt it?",200.9

"awesome game, infinite possibilitys. you can build tanks, drones, spaceships(or whatever) and even code them. workshops fine too. not to forget, gamemodes(for the bad builders) and updaates ! :d i can only recommend this game for people who like shooters/rp/sandbox games.",1286.6
"i do think garrys mod is a good game but there is some problems which i think should be fixed but for its price its worth your money if it was like 50$ i would not buy it but thats personaly",137.1
"this is one of the best games !! it is amazing and so much to do in it.... i love it:)",155.5
"ive played this game for a while now, and there is so much to do without getting bored. if youre tired of playing alone you can go co-op with other people or your friends in order to keep it excited! there are many game modes of which you can choose to play. i prefer darkrp alot myself. i would definitely recommend this game! 10/10",422.2
"when i rubbed my  on this game i rubbed like rambo with his appendix rupturing and having to have 9 days in the hospital i made my giant weiner floppy to hard with a point. you can build almost nothing in this game but weinerships or  space ships if your fancy.",515.3
"this is the best creativ game! much better as mine craft or somthing! =^,....,^=",464.3
"an amazing game.. lots of things you can do with it. unleash your creativity with this game. i rate 9/10",45.2
"garrys mod is pretty undescribeable but ill do my best its basically a game in which you are given the ability to entertain yourself any way you wish and the beuty of it is that if something you want isnt in the game you can make it i have spent hours (as it shows above) on this game and can definately say it has what alot of games dont. the players full imagination as the driving force to play the game.",439.2
"one of if not the best sandbox games out there with a huge online comunity. i definatly recomend garrys mod (gmod) 10/10",64.5

"its great for people who love sandbox,funny,mods and blood and stuff",269.0

"great game, as you can tell by my 670 hours of playing this. sure to keep anyone bored, not bored. theres plenty to do: trouble in terrorist town, role play, plus many many many many many more. in single player(sandbox) it features building with objects from hl:2 and more.",715.0

"the first game i buy throught steam. is one of the best game i ever play!!!!",509.7
"i give this game a 9.5 out of 10. i take .5 off because of its few hidden flaws, but it gets 9.5 because theyve managed to keep its flaws hidden. the game is something you can control, and all the power is in your hands. ive gotten hours of enjoyment from this game, and i still do. i recommend this game to anyone who plays video games (thats every teen with a computer or console). this game has made it to my best games ever list, and frankly i doubt it will ever move from there.",1637.9

"when i first played gmod, i played normal sandbox. then when you start playing multiplayer with tons of game modes your will never stop 10/10 love it",83.2
"this is one of the most creative and hilarious games i have ever seen. the content for this game reaches even farther than....well its gotta lot of content to it. i would have to recommend this to anyone who love ridiculous games (the saints row series) and rag doll effects. truly one of the most remarkable and noteworthy games of today.",192.1
"i spent a small amount of time playing this game. it was good.",1098.1
"garrys mod the only way to explain it is to have a open mind let your imagination flow like a rampant beast from making a death trap or storm troopers fighting a dragon on fire in the mushroom kingdom the life blood of this game is the mods",489.5
"yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. perfect sandbox game! also a good ammount of gamemodes! (my favorite gamemode is ttt!) if you are thinking of getting this game.... ...get... ...the... ...game!!!",939.2
"its so awsome game you can build and kill npc and drive cars so so awsome game",64.7
"garrys mod -- the all-in-one sandbox game. whether its movies, screenshots, or just mucking about in general, garrys mod should keep you (and others) entertained for a long time. also, its $10. instead of pirating it (like i know a bunch of other people have), just dont buy that pizza you wanted today, and you should have enough for it.",627.7
"the one time where it is ok to wrongly use physics.",43.1
"this game is fun and is good for people who like to use there imagnation. this game is good for mini gamemodes. i recommend this game for all people with creative ideas",433.9

"its good but dont play it because it will consume your life",1587.7
"when i first saw garrys mod and tested it a little, i was critical of it. but when i took it upon myself to buy the thing, i was in love. you could spend hours upon hours of sandbox alone, making a group of police fight a horde of zombies for your enjoyment. but then you get to multiplayer. prop hunt, murder, trouble in terrorist town, etc. this game is by far best with friends, but theres no shame in playing alone. still a butt load of fun to be found. 10/10.",16.5
"joined a server and got  by a homeless person 10/10",864.2
"one of my favourite games on steam. its only 5.99, and with literally hundreds of thousands of add-ons and custom gamemodes, its definitely worth the price for the amount of fun you can have on it. you may want to get a group of friends together to play it at first as some of the tools can be hard to use, but after an hour or two, you can make anything you want, with a few youtube guides maybe.",396.8
"this game is a must-have for those who seek creativity and ideas.........",14.4
"i primarily play ttt on omnisync server. occasionaly play other game modes most are pretty fun.",1031.7

"the creators did a fantastic job of not including the textures you need to run the game, with the game. the red errors and purple and black checker boards are stunning, and truly aid to the overall immersion of the game. however if you do want the textures, be sure to buy, eh mine as well just buy the whole valve collection just to be safe. 10/10 would spend $100 fixing the textures again!",25.2
"the community is primarily butthurt 12 year old bronies. not even fun. otherwise its a good sandbox for autistic children like myself.",35.7
"awsome game with a never ending amount of things you can do in it",977.3
"garrys mod is one of the most addicting and fun games on steam... this game is defently worth it. all the time and fun moments you get when playing online with your friends (not using hamachi). if you got any problems with hamachi just delete it and download tunngle, since my friends and i downloaded tunngle.. we didnt had any problems anymore with connecting to eachother :d further i would defently recommend this game! best game on steam ever! groupname: #potato gang",453.8
"i have so much fun testing mods and playing gamemodes good job. great game.",954.3
"very great! what ever you do, dont download a ton at once! crashes this thing since its old game, but very fun! c:",534.7
"+ fun with friends + you can make some neat stuff with this - breaks easily - boring if you are playing alone - takes time to master - messing around with stuff isnt always that fun",15.7
"its like a game inside a game which is also inside a game",785.5
"epic game for such a price with hundreds of gamemodes to play and stuff to do, one of my favrot games",364.8
"if you enjoy little kids with mics shoved 3 feet down their throat in hatsune miku skins attempting to bludgeon you to death with a rainbow  then this is the game for you.",138.2
"best game i have!!!!! if you get this you have to try darkrp its the best!!!",1341.9
"garrys mod where to stard its a great game so fun and their is only one fault in the game that i see and that has to pe the css errors if you dont have css i recomend getting it before gmod",283.1
"its a very fun game with lots of addons and game modes.",349.7
"i really enjoy this game, its fun and has tons of game modes. seananners really brought this game to my attention as i think he brought many of us that play it now. i really enjoy the prophunt and sandbox modes. sandbox really lets you use your crative side. over all its a great game and well worth the money.",409.2
"this amazing sandbox offers unlimited possiblites. the content is generated by the players. the only limit to this game is the source engine, which is for the most part not a bad thing. the maps and graphical content suffer from this, but the gameplay is the heart of this game which makes it truley amazing.",1055.6
"very fun game you can do just about anything in it.",465.1
"one time i ran over hatsune miku while driving a bathtub. 11/10 would recommend",576.3

"one of my most played games. no end to what you can do.",781.9
"got killed by a guy falling on my head. 10/10 would die again.",239.9
"sucks  as a game. servers take eons to load even on a good connection. every server is infested with roleplaying toddlers and pointless mini-games. the fact that it requires source engine games to even work is going to suck if you dont own at least one. luckily tf2 is f2p so youre not completely screwed if you dont want have (or want to buy) one of valves games. the only use for garrys mod that is worth buying it for is to test programming and character models in a game engine. but im relatively sure there are other programs that do that better.",7.4
"cool,awesome game buy it and download it its cooooooooool i love you garrys mod!!!",647.8
"not what i expected. i bought this game and it was pretty dang good. giant sandbox, endless creations. it crashes a few times but still awesome. recommended.",217.1

"garrys mod is a really fun game but the only thing about it is you really should get counterstrike source with it so you have the missing texture packs. buy counter strike source and gmod and go have fun!",8.9

"dis game suks so muk dek i cent even pley multeplyer",416.9
"too much too do!! i never get bored playing this game! incredible mods, gamemods! thumbs up",61.5
"this game sucks balls without the cummunity and the only reason it is good because monkeys came all over garrys face and made the wonderful land of lifepunch. lifepunch is where dreams  true, and time goes by at light speed. ttt sucks balls. gmod tower sucks balls. stranded sucks hairy balls. everything sucks gentials besides lifepunch.",805.6

"ever thought of doing random stuff with your favorite characters? go ahead, cause garrys mod has got it all, and did i mention you can nuke things cause i sure like to see stuff go kaboom, also this is used for many youtubers as an animation program to make those wacky tf2 videos you see on youtube, so go ahead, spread the mayham, make some noise, do whatever the heck you want!",40.5
"autistic? struggle to control your creative juices? like to fap uninhibitedly? bullied in school? the ultimate sandbox game returns to stimulate what the other kids have been beating out of you! create titillating sex poses of all your favourite valve characters, roleplay as an under qualified member of soceity, even spawn tens of objects and stare blankely at the screen! yes, all this and more is possible with the extraordinary potential on offer in gmod!",330.0
"its cool and you can play whith your friends its perfect",385.8
"well i had to get a seperate drive for my addons, so theres that. its fun i guess. hey did you know you can do some crazy stuff with the models in this game? you could like, download a tohka skin and like do.. stuff. and theres all sorts of poses and anima-.. yeah this games pretty fun.",325.5
"definitely one of the most fun games ever made, just needs a few linux issues fixed.",137.2
"great game to play alone and with friends! altough there is a few techincal problems that could be fixed it is one of the most unbuggiest? i guess thats how youd say that, anyway like i was saying this game has great potential to lift your spirits if feeling down or even make you feel high!... from laughter!!!!!",734.5

"garrys mod is a fantastic game, and in my experience (albiet a short one compared to most other people that have it) has been a fantastic one. if you can think it, you can do, build, create it. garrys mod is one of the few games that is only limited by your own imagination, and thats why i love it. in fact calling it a game is an understatement, its a whole world of its own, its what you make of it. i have experienced very few errors in the game, and the ones that i have experienced were so minute that it hardly affected the gameplay in any way. it is a truly remarkable title and i highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.",46.9

"i have no idea where to start. garrys mod is quirky, to say the least. with the endless choice of creative game modes which result in hours of fun and confusion as to where the last few hours have gone. definitely a game to play with a group of friends. unless you dont have any friends, in which case you can join a public server and make some! as well as the online game modes, it also features a sandbox mode in which you can build almost anything using the objects from practically every source game (and then destroy your friends creations when they inevitably build something better than you). definitely a game for a few hours of mindless fun. if you where looking for sanity, please look somewhere else.",59.2
