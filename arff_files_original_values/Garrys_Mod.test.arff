"why did i make such a late review? who cares this game is powered by the players creativity. its a game that will barely survive if steam workshop was not invented. the game itself is based on how can players manipulate their creativity, or will they survive a zombie mod. what about terrotists? theyre in here too!!! this game is highly recommended to stretch your imagination to new limits.",59.9

"garrys mod is a first-person sandbox game. you can build anything you want... well... almost anything. to the review!!! pros: you can save your creations and upload them onto the workshop, then spam your friends about the creation.. adjust the settings on how you want to play. (single-player, god mode, hl2 weapons enabled/disabled etc. etc.) subscribe to addons (mods) to make your game more fun. multiplayer is fun playing with others.... playing splayer is boring as you have no-one to play with.. get achievements... cons: doesnt have an option to use cs:s, tf2 weapons... you have to get them on the workshop overall rating (10/10!!! omg)",620.0

"to be honest, this is one of the best and most amusing sandbox games on the market currently. you can build rockets, make funny poses with ragdolls and npcs, and even making a gmod movie. this game uses graphics and designs that are from the orange box, counter strike and others. one of the greatest aspects of the game is addons. they are all free, from gamemodes to maps, player models to buildings all created by the community. even if you do not want to play sandbox, you can download gamemodes such as trouble in terrorist town, murder, prop hunt and much more! i can sometimes describe it as minecraft, with better graphics. 9.5/10",123.9

"there is sooo much stuff in this game it is nearly impossible to get bored in, but that said this game will take a lot, emphasis, alot of space. the community has good people (mostly) and there are plenty of gamemodes to choose from but, and im not getting paid to say this, (i wish i was) get the $20 version or the $10 version if you have cs:go. the free version has no textures and makes it nearly imposible to play adn the $10 has few textures but is still playable, and the $20 version has all the textures. but if you get the $10 (maybe free as well) and then get cs:go (not a paid sponsorship) you will get all of the textures since the textures you get in the $20 version are the cs:go textures.",129.1

"on my opinion - this is best mod for a game ever! in this game everything is possible. you can spend your time in singleplayer making random mechanisms, or making animations (yeah, some people doing that, and making money on it. so why not?) or you can play in multiplayer on many game modes (sandbox roleplay, trouble in terrorist town and ect.). this game have many features. so what are you waiting for?",777.7
