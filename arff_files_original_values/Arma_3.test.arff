"this game is one of the best i have ever played. after 600 hours it still isnt boring.",652.5
"this game has so much potential. the only con i can give it is set up time. little technicalities here and there destroy the flow. but when everything is smooth, this game is 10/10",661.4
"arma is a amazing game with amazing graphic gameplay and tons of fun multiplayer servers. i strongly reccomend this game!",52.5
"if not for the horrendous ai that plagues arma titles, this would be a great game. the ai makes it impossible to really enjoy. they are absolutely inept when given orders: completely refusing to respond to orders most of the time or attack hostiles accurately when on your team. though the ai manages to have 360 degree aimbots when you personally face them and have no issues navigating obstacles: only when faced against you.",191.2
"alpha and already more awesome than several tripple a games",152.4
"poor fps. the life moeds are a bunch of fun if you feel like meeting new people. wasteland is also fun. i only reccommend this if you think you can run it, make sure you do research before you purchase it.",117.7
"if you like first person shooters and realistic military campain, this is definitely the game for you. it contains all sorts of gamemodes and missions. and custom gamemodes on servers. (roleplay, team deathmatch, etc.",55.3
"this is a awesome game! its a army simulation based game with no white dot on the screen to help you hip fire, you wont be seeing much of that. the vehicles are smooth with a steady internet connection. i would recommend that you practice your flying skills on single player to get the hang of it so when your in battle with 8 guys in the back you know what your doing.",230.0
"fuken climb in the bushes m8, shoot the biches get the girl, alright",342.1
"i am really good at this game come at me scubz lol feggets",1.5
"runs smoother then the last, and theres already alot more diverse mods and game modes.",152.0
"joined altis life. met man willing to assist me. trusted man. man gets gun. man ties me up. man steals pants. 10/10 would get pants stolen again.",55.2
"its arma....... although arma 2 is still better in my opinion. 10/10",25.9
"i love this game but an alien addon would be great tho :)",248.2
"very much like its predecessor, arma 3 has certainly kept alive the milsim theme. absolutely heart pounding silence mixed with adrenaline filled firefights. all in the backdrop and setting of a very beautiful two islands. a must buy!",68.7
"so realistic that i die in one shot 11/10 would buy again",114.1
"this is a must have game its a war simulator its op!!",96.4
"kill . get moaned at. get banned. cri evritim. play again. repeat. 10/10",133.0
"not you daily average fast paced combat. most people says it is a military simulation and somehow i agree. smart devs, if you are bored you can try the virtual arsenal or the military fashion or maybe create missions in the editor where you just actually spawn random things. and its modable, too bad theres little in the workshop than armaholic. personally i like it, doesnt require high specs and its really breathtaking. campaign, multiplayer, showcases, custom made campaigns and many more. you dont have to be arma 2 veteran to play it. because this game is for everyone for those who wants to migrate from fast paced combat to military simulation.",301.9
"i became an apple picker and a cannabis druglord in less than an hour 10/10",41.3
"arma 3 is a awesome game to play most of the community have respect and there are plenty on mod",359.6
"this game is just great. i think it is one of the best milsims out right now and no other game can compete with it.",244.5
"awesome game! wasnt too sure about it during the beta, but upon full release, this game is really awesome. there are lots of great planned (free) features coming out soon as well, which is great, as things will never get dull. the devs are activly updating and adding new content. if you are a fan of arma 2, you will love arma 3",17.6
"is a good game and for life is not dont play arma 3 life rpg is so  play arma 2 life island have funn to see this  !!!!!!!!!!!",33.1
"this game is like being underwater. but the water has been replaced by feelings of isolation, claustrophobia and bullets. bullets hatefully fired at your face by nameless and unseen minions. and these bullets dont stop. until you stop...moving.",29.6
"very good its worth the price tag but make sure you have an amazing computer or you will be getting about 7 fps :p",312.8
"i officially declare this game to have one of the 3 worst single player campaigns i have ever experienced in my long gaming career. whyyyy?! why did these guys waste so much time on something that that they are not good at, instead of fixing the existing bugs and adding custom content? arma iii is unique, like a special needs kid whos messed up in the head but can also hack through the most advanced security system. it has a lot of potential but you have to have a monster pc and swim through a lake of cr*p to get to the good parts. disappointed i am very much so far, but i cant not recommend this game, even in its broken state. i am however probably going to revert to arma ii.",247.0
"i run around with no clothes on and shoot bad guys 10/10 would shoot bad guys naked again",17.4
"arma 3 isnt just one of the most realistic military simulations/games but it also has extensive modpack support and lets you enjoy modpacks such as altis life (gta style rpg) aswell as wasteland and many others. well worth the money imo.",481.7
"ive had this game for some time now and i have to say...its amazing...there are tons of little things you could complain about but the over all picture is perfect....ive mostly been playing wasteland so i dont have much to say about the singleplayer and what not...",160.0
"arma 3 is an improvement over the previous ones, but the game still suffers from clunky interface and lackluster ai. for an arma fan like myself, though, it is the best arma so far.",781.4
"thaught me how to use a grid properly, failled miserably due to lack of understanding of geometry. education has failed me on geometry.",34.3
"great game and great community content provided us with an awesome experience. keep it going bi!!",317.4
"amazing as sh***************************************************************************************8i*********************************8t",10.6
"possibly the worst game created so far, even compared to really  indie titles. this game was never optimized for a computer from the look of things. if you run intel anything youll be fine, but god forbid that you run amd youll get 0-20 fps no matter what situation. the developers for this game are autistic  who have clearly never cared for gameplay in anything, sure you can argue its a simulator, not a game but its still a military simulator. there is no effort for gunplay whatsoever in this torm of a simulator. all the guns feel the same, bullets never connect where theyre supposed to, you run around feeling clunky as  shooting nerf guns at nothing. tl;dr pros: its a game cons: its a really  game low/nonexistant fps  gunplay models are ugly server list sucks just about every game out there is better than this , and thats terrible seeing as theres a full dev team that made this. just take your $60 and spend it elsewhere, thats all there is to it.",152.8
"this game is just amazing and just addicting the altis life makes it evern more fun with friends and a great community",648.0
"the problem is, is that bis have gone full psycho. they say they want their game to be a big sandbox that everyone can mod on, and that was true of arma 2. but now, in arma 3, there are very few vehicles, and theyre all sci-fi. theres a ton of bugs, the game is only half finished, and they tricked everyone into paying $60 for it, saying it would be finished upon release. which was a total lie. now, if you complain about that on their forums, your banned without any explanation. they even ban your ip so you cant make another account. its also a steam game, so the producers lurk on the steam forums, and if they see you complain on there to steam, they ban you there as well, since they have mod status. and now, even if you say oh well, its half baked, and start making suggestions for improvement, they ban you for that as well. so basically, you cant say anything on their forums now. unless its to kiss their  and tell them how wonderful they are. the arma forums are a ghost town to everyone but fanboys. everyone else has been banned. its a shame, because it was a good game / sim. but the greedy as.s.holes at bis have turned into worse than ea, and all they care about now are lies and money.",39.0
"i like this game because it promotes same sex relationships. in a firefight i was told to engage a man.",106.2
"completely unpolished game with an engine that runs poorly. expect crashes often and low fps on even the best rigs. down right terrible execution of a game/idea.",120.0
"awesome sandbox military simulator, with mods like breaking point and wasteland, this game will bring heaps of fun in a openworld island scenario, highly recommended.",5.8
"singleplayer: + smart a.i + can be hard + lots of missions and scenarios - story is not anything special or interesting multiplayer: + lots of servers + lots of players - server browser is slow -some servers need extra add ons to play -sometimes no servers come up in browser - can be laggy community: +can be helpful to new players + mods improve the game - alot of trolls - lots of hackers/ scripters gameplay: + can change attachments & clothes during a fight to help + driving is fun +/- controls for just about everything - very demanding game for hardware - can be buggy - guns sound the same - not enough guns (without mods) -cars flip too easily overall: 8.5/10 best if you play arma 3 with mods, vanilla game can get boring.",131.4
"pretty realistic game. but it sometimes takes 20-30 min to find an enemy to kill. but still fan.",7.1
"ever since they messed up and changed the weapon sway the game is ruined. i want a refund, i feel betrayed and hurt.",340.1
"this game is brilliant! whilst it does have a massively steep learning curve, when you do start getting it right you feel like an absolute boss! the multiplayer is great but takes a lot of practice. buy this game, its awesome!",123.8
"very good game highly recommend :nato: :nato: :nato: :nato: :nato:",70.1
"best campaign in my opinion. 11/10 oh yeah, multiplayer is epic, too. 12/10",225.3
"just buy the f**king game already. if you need to read reviews your ready to perchase.",333.2
"uses ofp engine from 10 years ago. recommends gtx 560, i have 580 and never get more than 20 fps no matter what my settings are. this game was made by dirty slavaboo gopniks who have no ing clue what theyre doing.",43.0
"one word can describe this game: awesome. arma 3 is a realistic military sim. even with that in mind, for those who dont enjoy the realism, this game is one of the best fps ever created and offers something for everyone. map sizes are ridiculous, think of an average gta iv map, times that by ten. vehicle mechanics are greatly improved over arma ii, which makes them fun to drive, and gives you another sense of immersion. when your driving an armored vehicle, you actually feel empowered. as for weapons, the quality of the models, and the sound bytes are amazing. its not like your average fps....with headphones, every weapon sounds exactly like it would in real life, not some pew pew sound. i would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a boredom cure, with community made mods and game types, there is something in it for everyone.",68.2
"i find this a really fun game u can play many game modes like arma 3 life arma 3 takistan life arma 3 city life... i think this is a really good game for people who are starting pc",88.1
"only game i really play on steam now. highly recommend getting it if you like realism in games",970.8
"not sure wether to say yes or no really... i mean, i have arma 2 and play it alot, and i like the new graphic yadda, yadda, yadda... but i dont like how hard it is to convert if you play arma 2... yaknow? being use to bullets hitting their marks from an assult rifle from 150 meters away... also some button and vehicles are just wierd and provide no cover at all... u.s. military would never use them... on the topic of vehicles by the way, where the **** are the humvees and hu-1ys?!?!?!?! sorry but i dont have my good chopper or cars... instead i get moon rover crap and guns i never even heard of... i will stick to arma 2 for now and i hope for more modern stuff later in devolpment...",140.3
"arma 3 is one of the best selling fps sandbox games ever made. some of those people come from arma 2 or arma 1 but most people i know, arma 3 was their first arma game. from flying helicopters to infantry rush. arma 3 has a huge community and is still growing today! also not to note the spectacular performance by the dev team update almost weekly. the best thing i love about aroma is there always going to be something new each time you play from altis life to the realism units. friend me if you want to see some screenshots of arma 3 ~macmaster",542.2
"u focken wot m8? i swer tu got, i stab u in da arshehole with m,ah chuopsticksz best review ever 1/10 would bang agein! - ign",8.7
"if you like to pretend to be a russian guy living his normal life, but have to overcome the pitfalls of  gui and ai, get this game.",65.2
"i wish they done the sale up to 20th so i cold get it :(",7.4
"banned for someone elses fault period life in altis gets givin million bux bi bans me  you bohema!  you!",143.4
"good game, just too buggy, unoptimised, and overpriced",33.9
"my hours on record should speak for the game itself, its only in beta and already is such a fun game, sure the ai are a little buggy but wasteland, coop, hell even just playing helicopter tag is fun. its a sandbox game so you can spawn in stuff in the editor and create a mission and then play it however you want to. one of the greats of our generation going beyond anything call of duty, battle field, halo have done or probably will do i highly recommend this game.",345.8
"10/10 worst game ever. horrible controls, extremely unbalanced,  graphics. the developer should be ashamed of this travesty.",4.0
"first off all there is no bikes like there was in arma 2 but this simulator is still fun",321.3
"i dont know how to get in to severs it kicks me out all the time why ??",5.7
"a great simulator of my home country, alpacastan. i appreciate the correct modelling of alpacastanians, and there wonderful law-enforced attire of blue striped shirts, hats, tan shorts, and sandals. i also love the fact that you can recreate traditional alpacastanian picnics within this great simulator. it always brings tears to my eyes to remember the death of my grandfather, backwards cap guy- he was hit by a car, and then shot by a spy during the great cleansing of stan. rip, he will be missed. 11 frolicks out of 10.",420.0
"wow, such realism. much bullet drop. so tactical. 10/10 would simulate again.",41.1
"definetly a step-up towards more realistic gameplay than cod and battlefield series. steep learning curve with all sorts of options in how to affect your avatar in the environment - too many for most of us - so it really takes time to get into. huge sandbox environments so plan on spending several hours in a match rather than your typical 20 minute arcade-shooter match. some of the options and controls do feel a little clunky at the moment. you do need a pretty decent rig to run on full graphic settings to get the most out of it. challenging - very challenging. great realism - it can be fustrating for new players so expect it going in.",8.1
"good game although multiplayer optimisation is ing awful. i have 60 fps on high settings through singleplayer, once i connect to a server i am on less than 20fps on low settings. that is the reason why i dont play the game anymore.",18.3
"this game is great, bohemia interactive did a good job improoving on some of the things that were not so good in arma 2. for instance there is a massive inprovement in physics and the ability to go on or below the surface of the water is something that is not needed but adds a whole new experience to the game and something else to watch out for. the maps are detailed and interesting and the veichles have been given the pip feature (picture in picture) so wile your in a veichle there are backup cameras or mirrors that actually show what is behind you. all of the veichles both land air or sea have great modles and a relistic sound effect that makes the game even more imersive. i definitly recomend this game to anyone who likes a tactical military simulator. also those that are contimplating getting the upgrade form arma 2 you will be pleasantly suprised.",153.8
"this game is amazing. campaign - 9/10 and multiplayer is probably the best part of the game especially the altis asylum servers. i recommend getting it",402.6
", you pay $60.00 for a game only for it to be 40% off, 3 days later!!",5.7
"best fricking game ever. limitless possibilities. cheap dlc. 9.8/10",749.2
"i dont even own the game and i am writing a review.......",0.2
"the reqirments are way too high and too good for my pc to handle",0.5
"best war-sim ever. great fun when u have a squad going :)",44.7
"from altis life to breaking point arma 3 has become one of my favorite games. their are countless amounts of missions and game modes you can play, i highly recommend this game to everyone!",64.8
"its like arma 2 but better in every way. so its not like arma 2",52.8
"endless hours of fun. so much funny and awesome  happens. however, it is pretty commanding on your pc. but thats easily fixed. it only gets better the more friends you have playing with you. i would like more of mine to have it (ing buy it casey). anyway, great game! so many amazing memories and it hasnt even been that long. highly recommend it.",470.7
"ive been playing the campain recntly, and omg its is amazin. so far i love it. it is the way that i always wanted to play arma 3, but its damn near imposbile without a great clan that does this kinda stuff all the time. so i welcome the campain with open arms. as for the game it self, you should only get it if you know what youre getting yourself into. this is not the avrage military shooter that we are used to. (not that there is anything wring with the avrage military shooter, i really enjoy those games as well) if you have doubts about getting this game, defanitly check some gameplay on youtube first.",52.2
"i do recommend this game. not only for what it is but for what it will be ad its posibilities. it is just out of the scale!",56.3
"its a very fun game, but what i hate about is there is a lot of problems. very bad game if you dont have a good cpu.",50.6
"i got killed by a car park barrier closing on my car while driving under it. beat that for authenticity.",204.8
"a very cool game, i just need a new videocard so i can play it in all its glory. also would like to find a good arma 3 comunity.",26.8
"a very recent purchase of mine. it is overall a great game with many amazing features. then after you get kinda good on the campaign, you can take place in the anal penetration that is multiplayer.",15.3
"sick of the absurdness of the call of duty franchise or the so called realism of the battle franchise? well switch to arma. with stunning graphics and amazing lighting effects. the realism in this game might be too much for some, but thats what the games about, true realism. no idiot sprinting with a sniper rifle or ramming a jet at tanks here. this game is for the mature audience, not prestige 12 year olds.",49.9
"the thinking mans shooter. also hilarious physics glitches and one of the most active and diverse modding communities out there. if you like shooting things, but dont have the reflexes for cs anymore, get this. its amazing!",201.0
"i got this for $20 with early access and it was definitely worth the money. if youre looking for a military simulator, youve probably already heard of arma, the best military simulator out there for the public. if youre looking for something more realistic than battlefield or even insurgency, this is what youre looking for. thanks to the new helicopter flight update, its essentially/almost a flight simulator as well, as they took parts of their actual flight simulator game engine and put them into arma 3. i dont know if i could say i would recommend purchasing it for $60, but for half off, id go for it.",168.0
"does anyone know how or if you can change your player id? if i reinstall the game will this change or not?",266.9
"an excellent military simulator, has a large learning curve and requires patience inorder to to become skilled at. like most multiplayer games, arma 3 works alot better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination, which is a very important factor in arma 3. its fairly system intensive , but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches, but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. i would highly reccomend it, especially if you have friends to play it with.",13.5
"i honked a horn at my enemy and he honked back in team deathmatch. 11/10 would play",7.3
"better combat than arma 2. now are the guns better? yeh, attachments make them better. do they handle better? well, id argue that the damage system and how bullets flyed was better in arma 2, and that people move too fast when jogging in arma 3. but then again, people still play battle royal and koth in arma 3 so yeah, arma 3 is better.",114.2
"this is my most favorite game atm, updated regularly and great people to play with. recomend to anyone.",305.1
"arma 3 is a simulator first/third person shooter, one of the most realistic games ive seen come by in a long while. you better have a good computer if you plan to play multiplayer some servers really take a beating on framerate, if you like military or just good ol pvp in general this is quite the game to sink some time into... the new map dont hold how special wasteland was in alpha/beta but its still the core mentallity of the gameplay.",864.1
"this game is by far one of the best tactical shooters i have ever played. i love the maps and the way the game feels in the way of how the weapons work, the movement, and the flow of the game just feel amazing.",739.5
"arma 3, in my opinion, is probably the best arma in the series. not only does it boast tons of new features such as virtual aresenal, new inventory system and new, easier controls, the all around kindess community is also great. some random person took an hour to help me learn the basics. the loads of game modes add to the diversity of the game. insurgency is one of my favorites. this game has so much community content, the fun never ends. i would definetly reccomend this game!",78.6
"this game is just amazing, it is a game that requires a big big computer, but it looks fantastic as soon as you get the computer! i may have only killed one person, but this game is just really fun, coop, sandbox, tdm, rpg, and so on!",47.4
"verry god game and you can download many mods to make it more fun:)",60.9
"i remember playing this game after getting a taste of arma 2 and i was so disappointed. i joined a invade and anex server and got killed over and over by the super op aim hack ai. i was just about to rage quit, when one of the server group members asked me if i wanted to join their squad to play with them. they told me what to do and after an hour i got the sweet taste of arma team play. i joined the group after a while and started playing user made missions with mods and holy . it has been the best year of gaming i have ever had. if you like millitary tactics and teamplay, arma is right up your alley. it is not like any of the big fpss out there, you dont feel like a action movie super soldier. you feel just as vulnerable as the other guy on the receiving end of your barrel. if you are ever going to play this for the milsim part of the game, get yourself a group to play with. nr. one advice. i watch this every time i wonder why i play arma and i just want more:",864.8
"the best military simulation and getting better. one word of caution if you do not have mid to high end hardware especially graphics card do not buy this game. it is absolutely beautiful and i often find myself looking around at the scenery.",610.0
"tried to get on a ferris wheel on a server and it insta killed me. 0/10 would not play again.",30.9
"arma/10 arma 2 but with better graphics and butt sliding sold sold sold sold the best game ever",83.5
"we destroyed a helicopter so hard, it crashed the server 10/10",429.3
"best game i own. 300+ hours. strongly recommend it",373.3
"10/10 best walking simulator on the market, would walk again",750.7
"its a really good military sim. it kinda better then arma 2 but still have a little bit of bugs.. but, beisde that... this game suck! just kidding! arma 3 is where it is at! best military sim out there! keep up the good work, bohemia interactive! i love you for making arma! when, i first saw arma in a gaming magzaine.. i always wonder would i ever play this game. got a pc played arma 2 free version boom fell in love with it! three days later brought arma 2 and arma oa loved both of it. the mods, the game, the capaign, and etc! one i heard arma 3 came out! it felt like i was having an ! i was excited! thank you again, bohemia interactive. for making an awsome game like arma! i really hope great things will come out from this game in the furture. :)",188.8
"so far arma 3 has been worth every penny spent. even though the gameplay is simmilar to arma 2 its has its perks. i am now part of a great arma community and love play with fellow team mates that love the games as much as i do. if your intersted in military sim and not cod then this game should not be lacking in your library,",174.4
"sweet game, only requires an awesome computer to run it.",580.7
"great game even though it still has some issues on altis but i definetly recommend it, its worth every penny",198.9
"gameplay is good. but then its the arma series, the servers are not optimized properly, even with high-end hardware your bound to get low fps. until they actually get their  together and optimize the game. its a no from me :p.",40.9
"the most realistic first person shooter game i have ever played and with it comes a very mature community of players.",172.1
"this is the greatest game ever. great grapics and fun vehicals 11/10.",7.1
"pretty, the mods are what is great. vanilla game is trash. the dlc are terrible, do not reward them with your $$$ for go carts, a  chinook, and a rasberry beret. ing insulting.",675.9
"bohemia interactive made their debut with operation flashpoint and then changed to arma series afterwards. since the first installment it has been downhill up to third one. the engine is heavy, unoptimised, clunky for smooth gameplay no matter what setup you may find for your pc. the menu and ui interface is also archaeic and still as slow as it was in ofp days. i cant see justification for this game unless it would be around 4,90 and even then its not worth your time. the map is boring and unimaginative compared to that of chernarus, sahrani and the multiple locations of ofp. as for gameplay the shooting is well done and the many ways of controlling your character is definitely the best of the industry has to offer. its unfortunate that the teamplay and coordination falls down to its own clunkiness. finally the modding is still there which offers replayability and whatever people come up with to use but still i find the engine and other problems within the core too deep to actually be worth of ones time.",11.4
"i enjoy how tactical it is. its a really fun game. cant get enough.",353.0
"amzing if you have other people to play with, the friendly ai is terrable dont expect to get anywhere with them.",140.1
"military sandboxing at its best. i come from the very first operation flashpoint, aka arma: cold war assault. and from that one, to arma, to arma ii and now iii, all it has been are major improvements. combat, movement, vehicles, graphics, its just keeps getting better and better. game still lacks content compared to arma ii, but its community and potention do promise. this aint cod, battlefield or payday 2. god rambo and die.",137.7
"i love this game but an alien addon would be great tho :)",248.2
"a difficult game with a bit of a learning curve with all the controls. fun, but multiplayer can be a pain in the  on the rpg servers. to many kids and people who dont care/cant speak english. sort of disapointed where my money was spent yet again. feeling disapointed with fpss as of recently.",139.0
"worth getting! even if you only like arma 3 altis life :)",67.0
"to me, the best one of the arma series. ive just finished the campaign and i had lots of fun. military simulation (challenging gameplay), open world, campaign, multiplayer, large variety of weapons, vehicles and uniforms + mod support and ingame editor. last but not least: awesome graphics. a.i. can be a bit dumb at times. if youve played operation flashpoint: cold war crisis and/or arma 1 and arma 2 you already know what im talking about, allthough it already got much better in my opinion. definite recommondation, especially for fans of ofp and arma.",113.0
"for an alpha this gives us a short but sweet insight visa what to expect in armas future. and the future is bright. decent performance, beautiful islands (only 1 included in this alpha), many improvements in movement, weapon systems and physics and best of all searchlights on helios that work!. and look sweet! that first moment when you look up at a lighthouse in the night and see those beams of light piecing the darkness youll know that arma should have a decent future when finally released. best of all, if you buy the alpha itll automatically upgrade to the beta and then the retail release for no extra cost! just dont forget to report those bugs eh? (the alpha is still buggy, has some ai issues and balancing issues. it is also short of content. do not expect a campaign or full featured game until release)",143.1
"at first i was like - (   ) but then - (   ) and then a bit after- (   )",204.3
"best military experience game ever made, graphics are way too perfect.",77.0
"this is one of those games you get because of the mods. the core game is nice, but the mods is what really makes it. battle royale, arma 3 dayz, altis life rpg, and many more things to do with this masterpiece military simulator. its a big step up from arma 2, however arma 2 (inc. operation arrowhead) have a few more things this doesnt have (like island life). great game overall.",53.6
"amazing game, infantry combat is great, helicopters are realistic (not dcs or take on helicopters realistic, but still amazing), vehicular combat is great, and take combat is amazing but again, like the helis, the tanks are not 100% realistic, but they are still great.",141.7
"the most accessible game in the series, this is bohemia interactives magnus opus and my favourite instalment since the days of operation flashpoint (now arma: cwc) and its incredible addons, the technological leap is huge and the possibilities for the end user are limitless, catering to any taste with a very active modding community to boot, potentially taking it far beyond a mil-sim. i have owned this game since the alpha phase and has been worth every penny, its never been perfect but the development team are constantly striving to make it so. one of the greatest titles ive had the pleasure of owning on the pc for many years.",291.8

"been playing arma since it was operation flashpoint. this is not an fps, rpg or rts although it can be all of that all at once. this is a war simulator. you give command to your subordinate. you strategically flank your enemies. you take cover when you see a tank rolling while your at team mate solve the problem for you. this is not an easy game. regular fps player will find it puzzling that you have your enemies in your crosshair but failed to hit them because the physics of bullet drop hit them. on the downside, the ai is not up to par. the game is unfinished although it is more of a nuisance because you can always rely on the community to produce a far more better finished game after that. and then theres the i cant seems to stop myself from playing this game even though i completed it.",108.0

"cleared a buliding by shooting through it with a .50. would penetrate again.",286.9
"this game is amazing for the most part. the map is huge, and the combat is usually fun, but you will most likely have  fps. i would recomend this game, but even with a high end pc you will be at sub 30 fps in cities, making shooting people hard at this point, and can cause you to crash when driving at high speeds. this will most likely make you very frustrated. so until they fix the fps issues dont buy it.",67.6
"this game is absolutely beautiful. some of my best moments have been on this game, not only is the vanilla game absolutely brilliant but the modding community is also spectacular. you can play as marines, army, navy, whatever you choose. that being said, some further optomization is necessary as this game has major lag spikes and crazy fps drops, even in singleplayer. i have played for 300 hours and have yet to play the campaign, its great. if you are wondering what this game requires graphics card wise, i am playing with a msi radeon r9 270x which is a mid range card, on all ultra at average of 50-60 fps (on singleplayer). for a long time i was playing with a nvidia geforce 610 which is a low end card but wsa still able to play and had great expierences with. so overall, no matter what your specs are, buy this game. if your specs arent quite good enough to run it on ultra or high the sheer gameplay expierences will make you want to invest mor time, and of course more money on pc games. gameplay 10/10 graphics 9/10 fps 7/10 storyline (from what ive seen from others and from the few missions i have dabbled in) 9/10 overall 9/10 would play",819.1

"great game. as of release it started out slow, but that certainly isnt new with the arma franchise. arma 2 started out the same way. fact is this game is big- its going to be played for years to come and well into the future. it has both a passionate community as well as development team. to use them as an analogy, arma is like a fresh baked batch of your grandmothers signature chocolate chip cookies as compared to the traditional store-bought chips-ahoy of contemporary bf/cod titles. granted, one is a tactical shooter and the others are less realistic arcade shooters, but im sure you know what i mean. this game is definately worth buying! keep it up bohemia.",251.5
"arma 3 offers you multiple sandbox multiplayer missions and variety of large scale battle scenarios. bullet travel and weapon ballistics are quite reallistic so its not your standart battlefield game. big maps and large game modding community make this game really specia. 11/10 would play.",532.9
"arma 3 is one of the greatest games i have ever played. apart from being my 2nd most played game on steam, i have been completely astounded by the amount of accessable gamemodes and innovative rps that are playable. if you are not into army simulations, dont warry. arma 3 will have a gamemode suited for you. 9.5/10",162.1
"very complex but once you past that great slowed down fps",10.4
"the arma series has always been the best military simulator to date with the most realism ive seen. with arma 3 they have out done themselves again. the game is so well optimized that it barely puts any stress on my system, and the graphic quality, and sound realism is unparalleled. you can play for hours in singleplayer, then jump onto multiplayer with your friends co-operatively work through a mission or against each other as enemies. with the steam workshop so tightly knit into the game itself, you can download other player created missions be it single or multiplayer. there is no end of fun to this game!",47.5

"recommend to anyone who likes any sort of combat game. has great balance of first person combat and vehicle (sea, land and air) combat. the weapons dont customise very much, but that doesnt matter so much as there is a very wide range of weapons and attachments. very well optimised and runs smoothly on all occasions. the only problem is if you are playing online with a computer running at low settings, as you cannot see enemys as clear or as far away as those with higher grade computers can, and sometimes becomes annoying. but the game is worth the purchase just for the campain.",86.9

"stole someones atv while he looted a body, and then ran on him and killed him. (battle royale) this game is awesome, it has an amazing single player (tough to beat), so much mods to play which is really really fun! like breaking point, wasteland, altis life or battle royale, though there will be bugs/errors, but just google it and solve it, its easy. i would defently recommend to buy this amazing game. 24/7 would play.",21.9
"tried the free weekend trail and i had a blast. the controls were hard to learn at first bit soon it grows on you. i recommend buying this game.",6.3
"this game is a military simulator. its very fun to play and instead of running into rooms guns blazing like most shooters there is a lot more stratergy in this. it has quite a few mods that you can download from playwithsix and the workshop now. im in a group called special team delta and we do operations every weekend and they are pretty fun. even without my group i can have fun on public servers playing wasteland or koth. the story is very good and is a good length. there are optimisation problems with the game. i cant really get over 50 fps on high with my $900 computer but even on 15fps it is still playable.",547.3

"the experiences in this game, are unforgetable and only happen in this game. it can feel like a movie, except youre in it, and youre the main character. this game is a must buy, and i mean that when i say it. beware though, once you get it, theres no going back.",153.9
"this is the game! if you had military training, you play milsim games such as airsoft or paintball, you are a fun of modern warfare, you want to experience a real life combat situation this is the game... arma 3 gives you unique experience, adrenaline rush a bit of frustration and great satisfaction with the completion of the given task. if you have military training you will find that it gives you an actual advantage in this game! bullets will pin you down and they will determine your next moves. its a total military simulation i totally recommend this game to players that are not fun of arcade like fps or consider battlefield (which is a great game) realistic.",43.0

"arma 3 - the game operation flashpoint tried to be on the consoles... this however, is a whole sifferent story. it is tough to start with but persevere and what you are presented with is a hard working, rewarding experience that only pc gaming can provide. if and when you finish the content the game is packaged with, you can then turn to the steam workshop and pick up hand crafted missions to keep you going for probably forever. to be honest this makes it look like cod and battlefield are aimed at the pre 15 year old market... ready to play something sensible and realistic? buy and play arma 3.",46.3

(while in multi, we have lesser players/aircraft e.t.c.) most servers are rpgs....almost no coop server. its very hard to find real strategy/realism/gameplay here.....the vids you see on youtube do happens, but its very rare....dont buy it. arma 3 is maybe the worst game i have ever bought after shogun 2..... and i really wanted to buy it....",2.9

"it was fun at first, but it grew old quickly. i purchased due to atlis life mod, and quickly found the lack of players willing to comply with server rules, made the game not so enjoyable. the large maps are nice and all, but too damn big for 100 or less people... i enjoy the realist consideration of the game, such as fatigue from sprinting, and its effect on aiming. overall, arma 3 does not have a lasting effect on me. some of the situations that occur are very fun, and memorable, but i often find myself logged in, running around in circles doing nothing. for large scale combat (meaning hundreds of players at the same time, in the same location), on maps the size of arma 3 maps, i would recommend planetside 2, which is a free-to-play game. the simulation arma 3 offers is extremely impressive, and quenches my thirst of rendering 360 no-scope headshot noobs useless. however, as a game, i dont enjoy it as much.",192.8

"a serious game with lots of mods, so every gamer will find something for his/her taste. my favourite mode is capture the island with bennys cti mod. lead your squad of soldiers, tanks, aircraft in the battle for territory on a huge and beautiful map. even has epoch, but the old one had better construction options.",499.9
"so far i like the game, i am not a cod fan but own many of there games, because imho cod was the best fps out till battlefield bad company 2 came out, then bf3 and now bf4 which are by far my favorite fps games. but arma series has allways had my attn. because of its mods and add ons! it truly looks as if they put allot of work into arma3 as it looks great and runs very smooth on even a cheap gaming rig where as the older games were a bit hard to run even on good hardware! i do think anyone that likes fpsers and willing to put in more than just run and gun should get this newest release, but keep in mind this is more like a simulation game than any other fps out there so most wont like it off the batt! i am running it on a older amd cpu phenom ii 970be quad core overclocked a bit and a gtx 680 classified and with some playing around got avg. fps to about 30 which is great in the arma series. i really love the story line so far and cant wait to see how far they take this game!",54.8

"i have been playing arma 3 for the past couple days (with the free trial), and i was really concidering buying this game. however, even with all the realistic featues that i love, i cannot stand the fatigue and weapon sway system. after running for 3-4 minutes, a short sprint, or getting nicked by a bullet, it becomes nearly impossible to aim. even while focusing and holing my breath, the weapon is still moving to dramatically to accuratly hit a target at even a hundred meters with a scope. the army is trained to be able to shoot under stress, fatigue, and even injury. i myself have done 100 meter sprints, and half mile runs, then grabbed my ar immediatly after and can still quickly and accurately hit a man sized target at 100 meters. also, i only shoot with iron sights. until this unrealistic fatigue and weapon sway system is fixed, i will not be buying the game. honestly, what is the point of buying it if i cant even engage the ai, (who, guess what, can still accurately shoot you while injured or fatigued!)",1.6

"buggy as hell. they never fixed weird issues like being able to walk through walls. hard to tell when youve actually shot someone. no real visual indicator that youve shot someone, so you end up shooting them 5 times out of confusion. single player campaign seems badly thought out. i basically had to save scum to get off of the first island. ai is awful. no armory mode or quick mission mode. i regret buying this in alpha.",27.3
"very well made, robust and fun game. the graphics are great and the game runs smoothly. the one thing that annoys me are the controls that can be some what overwhelming and clumsy, but they have made them to be as realistic as possible. they variety and freedom of this game is huge and gives a lot of room for modders to create great content. remember that arma is not a simulator, rather a set of tools that aim to be realistic and give a lot of freedom to the users and modders to do what they want with the game.",128.6

"so this one is a weird one. on the one hand this game can be an amazing amount of fun whilst playing several different mods already integrated into the system. it is some of the most tense fun ive had in a strategic fps. the game also looks pretty dang good, on the other hand this game screams beta, with bugs a plenty lack of many features that was avilible in arma 2. for example bi-pod integration still hasnt been going in. that alongside the dlc being added even though the game is extremely unpolished. simply put: arma 3 is great but also a big dissapointment from me. 6.5/10 p.s performance is still a huge problem for many people so make sure you can run it!",257.2

"since modern warfare 2 this is the best game i have played. although i liked the call of duty francise, it has lost its way and has become a game of mindless running around chasing xp points. arma is huge, fun and needs more care to complete your objectives. although it lacks instant multiplayer gaming, there are only a few games to play, you can create your own or download one from steam, all free of charge. it took a lot of getting used to but i love it.",616.8

"like its predecessor, arma 3 really raises the bar in the gaming industry. graphics, beautiful... physics, fluid... gameplay... enagaging... you wont find a shooter like it! the number of mods is growing rapidly, and thats what really makes the arma series what they are today. as with arma 2, you are purchasing a game, with many separate games embedded for mulitplayer, or singleplayer. due to the fact that this game is full release, there are no major issues, and its only recently been available! however i would recommend waiting for a sale or buying this game elsewhere, as i do think 40 is a little steep, atleast for me.",85.3
"dont get this game if you dont plan on playing it with mods. seriously. dont do it. vanilla a .",397.2
"a massive improvement from arma 2 (especially the voice acting). but i find the main dissapointment is the lack of weapon diversity and choice unlike arma 2. overall an amazing game well worth the price.",86.4
"so, i built my pc specifically to play dayz and such games. then arma 3 was released and i shyd away from the zombie series and into full on warfare instead. after coming from the cod franchise and the battlefield games, i was scepticle that i could be any good playing warfare on such a massive scale, let alone on pc. i got cracking and found that this game was actually very very well built. the graphics are smooth and crisp (depending on your setup) the gameplay is solid and immrsive and you quickly get sucked in to the firefights and stuff. campaign i found was a little left out, it felt like the game was centred as much around the multiplayer aspect as possible (i was used to that from playing cod) overall its an awesome game, would recommend just for the multiplayer part.",68.5
"this game has a lot of available game modes because of how many mods (mission files) people make. this game is diverse because of the modding community that the arma series has. while the game still needs more firearms to be implemented into it, i am sure the modding community will fix that issue. this game has been out for a couple years now and is doing strong. arma 2 had a strong following and i do hope that this will too. one downfall about this game that has been around since the alpha is that usb headsets are hit and miss. sometimes they have certain sounds cut out. the way i went around this issue is by selecting my optical out as my default instead of my usb headset (skullcandy plyr1). another downfall is the content. the game takes place the near future however the game does not include any current era firearms that are being used in any military force.",257.8

"the game is very hard to run on windows 8 and i have a amd 3.8 ghz 8 core cpu, with a gtx 760 with 16 gb of system ram,i should be getting 40+ fps on high but i get only a max of 27 fps and no higher. the game has extremely poor optimization dont buy the game. huge waste of money",4.5
"i did not enjoy arma ii. it was buggy and didnt run well and the gameplay was very clunky. but arma iii improved so much over arma ii. although there is the steep learning curve, once you wrap your head around it, it can be very fun. movement is much better now, interface has improved but could still use a bit of work and the graphics are gorgeous and the game runs nicely. one of the things that this game has over tradional fps games is intensity. gun fights are intense, you can feel bullets fly past you and if you miss a shot, it can cost your your life.",67.6
"really enjoy playing this game. coming from cod and battlefield i love the realistic attributes to this game compare to the other two. battle royale is by far my favorite mode in this game",16.6

"i love the game but sadly my computer doesnt have the right specs to just play it for as long as i want ive only played for 13 hours/ 45 minute rounds because thats how long it lasts hopefully i can get a new computer and play this game as long as i want but other then that the game is great and really fun with friends!",21.9

"this is definately the game to buy if youre playing with your buddies and you walk for an hour to meet up and then they randomly get shot while you sit back and die of laughter from them raging and then realize you have to find eachother on wasteland again. 11/10 would play again.",87.7
"if you enjoy a real challenge for a shooter/ simulator then the arma series is for you, this is not your typical battlefield or call of duty shooter(arcadish). i highly recommend this game and the other bohemia titles!!",75.3
"an interesting fps that is highly realistic, but still maintains a very fun feel. note: it is a fairly intesive game hardware wise, so i belive it will require a decent computer.",165.4
"arma 3 is an awesome game... i may not have played much of it.but it is very fun to play and the campaign is a challenge (at least to me). i would recommend buying this game if you are doubtful.",44.5
"its a must buy. love the graphics. love all the mods. i enjoy modding in this game, best game i like thats mod friendly. you must buy this game, you are missing out on all those cool multiplayer gamemodes like arma 3 life, wasteland, altis life, king of the hill, breaking point and epoch mod. buy now!",258.8

"very nice update to arma 2, particularly on the graphics side (recommend big gfx card). some work is still needed though, as single-player missions are still missing.",336.3
"as always, this still is the best military simulator in the world! arma keeps affascinating me for its realism. i really suggest you to buy the game if youre a fan of war, real war. the maps are really detailed and the ai is really ! actually, too much but there are mods that can help you resolve that problem. anyway, if you buy this game, play it with a clan. arma 3 really makes you cooperate with other people in order to survive and complete your mission. if youre a cod fan, you rather change side or forget about arma. they are completely different, and arma itself is usually not liked by shoot and run fan boys. however, armas editor allows you to create your own missions in every detail. actually, its not too simple making them, but with some commands and other stuff you can start making some nice missions and enjoy the game with your friends. furthermore, there are tons of forums and people that can help you improve your editing skills providing you with commands, suggestions, and scripts. enjoy.",151.9
"terribly optimised, the only half decent thing to play on it is altis life, and no matter what youre doing the fps seems to stick around 20-25. its not just that, the gun play seems too clunky for a military simulator. when you get past all the fps issues its not that bad of a game, but certainly isnt worth 36!",160.4

"i think this is a great game. you will probably learn alot of it, depending on how you play it. you can play either ways, the typical action game way or the simulator way. but back to the point, there is so much to do in this game, theres a big map and great graphics. a well made game, worth buying if youre into these games.",43.2
"it is awesome. it has a fun storyline as well as single player. multiplayer is a great to. i highly recomend it.",356.8
"this game is really good. i would give it a 9/10 and the reason i give it such a high rating is because there are endless things to do. such as altis life or maybe tactical missions but my favorite part of the game is flying. there is the standard flying which is sorta like a arcade flying but still has some realistic features then there is advanced flying. but besides that this game is just great before i had this game i was a lone wolf on arma 2 but on here i met a awesome group of people that i play arma 3 with every night we even have are own altis life server.",566.4
"would be good if they fixed the performance issues and shiity servers and the compatibillty with different drivers ect. come on arma ing get your act together! :d re edit: arma 3 is a decent game with alot to do and is very fun, it may have quite alot of dsync but still. it is very fun to play with friends especially on my favourite altis life where you can process and sell coacaine and even take marjeuna. this game is good but you better have a good pc, and hopefully a 15 or better otherwise your screwed and though amd and radeon is good, its sadly not good for arma. but stilll this is an amazing game :d",38.6

"the name in military simulation! it returns again! after a buggy and sometimes slow and tedious beta, the full launch has only impressed me more and more. new additions seem to always be in the works and the engine is a huge step above arma 2. game is lacking in content as of dec 2013, but once it gets the attention similar to arma 2 this game can only take off.",411.7
"arma 3, where to start? -amazing modding community -huge multiplayer (milsim communities eg shacktac) -in-game mission maker -zeus! -advaned flight model (new to the game) -firing from vehicles (new to the game) -nice campaign -2 maps (but the modding community have more) -tactial game, long-range firefights -really realistic, not like cod or battlefield! it has really unique gameplay. good game 10/10",219.2

"its great, better than cod and battlefield (my 2 cents) great to find something else other than youre average fps game",836.9
"for what this game tries to be (which is a war simulator) it fails misserably at that. the movement is clunky, the a.i is dumb and overpowered as hell. so if you get into this game being all like yeah, this is what war is like, this is realistic and really precise then sorry. you need to get out in the real world pall. because i dont consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic. same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs. this game is however one of the funniest games i have ever played with friends. the amount of vehicles, the guns, the destructible enviorment. the overall map is not to shabby either. if you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that. if you get it to play it as a serious war game then id say the clunky motions and faulty a.i ruins that emediatly",12.3

"well, after more than 450 hours on record, i have to say, it is the best game in the last years! there is so much to do with it. seemingly unlimited ways to modify the game or to make own missions with nearly unlimited access to everything you need! it deserves just one word: awesome!",475.6
"blows all other military shooters and previous arma games away",134.3
"arma 3 continues on the merits of the original operation flashpoint and while many additions imply much welcomed improvements throughout, the core of the issues remain unresolved, leaving complexity rather than depth. it is the best version of the sandbox/editor/experiment, but as a game, it is still the flawed mess that the original flashpoint introduced back in the days. atleast flashpoint had the excuse of originality being it was the first of its kind when released, which leaves arma 3 to nothing more than minor improvements in an environment that requires massive enhancements. buy if the previous titles meant something to you to the extent of wanting to experience them in a slightly newer engine. avoid if you expected them to actually make a game of quality.",50.8

"very realistic and has verstaile module options. a very realistic military fps/3rd person simulation game.",285.6
"arma 3 is the most realistic military sim ive seen. you can find no other game that goes in such detail with weapons than arma 3. though there is a huge lack of weapons and the maps are dull, empty, and boring, it is a good all-around game. what you cant find in the game you can find in mods although it can be inconvient since the since the arma 3 steam workshop only can allow 1 pbo and only 200 mbs of space. anyway its a great simulator that needs few improvements and steam compatibility but a great game.",745.8
"do you like tactics? do you like explosions? do you like tanks and explosions with tactics? do you like uavs with explosions with a convoy with tanks and explosions and amphibious apcs with tactics? then you need this game!",514.2

"totally worth the 45 euros. its an incredible game with or without friends..you can have so much fun and never get bored...you could choose any mod and altis life is amazing. the bad thing is the performance from the servers...they are really bad. you cant play with 60 fps...doesnt matter what setup you have. anyways, i think its still pretty good...buy it!",282.2
"why would anyone play this broken boring game just saw inside gaming play this so funny how bad it is do not pick this game up i got it at the free weekend thing and now i will not buy this very boring better off playing chaser.",1.1

"the only thing in the known universe more addictive than heroin.",406.5
"this game is fantastic, the campaign is a really nice addition, but the main focus is the multiplayer and coop aspects. the amount of possibilities of different missions you can do with the editor are pretty much endless, and the community is really active and produces a lot of great mods and add-on missions for you and your friends to play. the amount of fun you can have with this game is insane, especially if you have more than 3 people playing. the game runs pretty smooth most of the time, you can expect a stable 40 fps on altis with a fairly good pc. personally, i havent experienced any huge bugs for quite a while. so if you still havent got the game, and you love the combined arms aspect of war and tactical play, this game suits those needs quite well.",255.4
"the game is good. have many thing to do. but now game still lack of the mod i love the most since arma one is warfare mode. which is basebuilld around you to buy unit and explore the map and conquest the town i didnt said game was bad. im still that there will be official release for the warfare mode. the single player is ok for me. but the setting is not i love modern weapon which current in use like in arma 2 more than those prototye weapon. so this arma is still recommend if you want the simulator game that not hard. i love to drive tank and play infantry in this game , but fly model isnt that good so i didnt fly much but it easy enough to fly anyway and if you have friend to play with it awesome as developer including zues mode !!! if you dont want to play with mod this game dont have much thing like arma2 so wait more a bit i believe developer will release more content !!",56.4
"great shooter simulator! singleplayer might be boring for some people, but the online experience with a great community will give you a great time.",553.0
"awesome game from and awesome company. this game has given me hours of fun and with the dlc and free platform updates its juts keeps getting better and better. highly recommend but you would need a good pc to run.",655.1
"arma iii has outstanding visuals and a intense set of game play mechanics. this game is not for the average fps player, its for players who want more from the average fps shooter. all in all it takes awhile to get into but once you find a good community to play with you have a  ton of fun!",22.0
"this game isnt that bad, it lacks quantity of weapons and vehicles though. i would have to say in the long run, arma 2 and arma 2 oa are better in terms of quality and quantity.",802.3

"best game na such wow so yummy so much play time to fun wasteland is the best",244.2
"very good game but you do need a decent computer to play multiplayer",849.7
"recommending this game is a no-brainer. if you are even into shooters with a nag for realism arma 3 is inevitable. the game wont let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like cod or battlefield. the best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. groups range from run-and-gun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff, so there should be something for everybody.",355.7
"pretty good game... would be a great game if it was better optimized. i would get it on sale but i wouldnt pay full price for it. edit: this game has so much potential but the developers failed to optimize the game at all. do not buy this game until they fix it, if they ever do... so disappointing and such a let down.",122.2

"this games engine is 10/10 in singleplayer, but once things go to multiplayer, everything goes to hell. after 417 hours im pretty much done with it. sick of the lag and desync issues on every server i play on. i have a fiber optic internet connection, and i7 4770k@4.6ghz, 2 r9 280xs in crossfire, and 16gb of ram. the game is also running off a ssd, that is solely dedicated to it. and yeah blah blah blah, its arma and its always ran bad online, but its only worth putting up with for so long. no weapons have been added to the base game since i bought it, there was one helicopters dlc that was okay. this games main selling point is mods, yet running mods on an already desyncing and laggy mess does nothing but make it worse and further the unplayability of it. so, until the multiplayer is at least being worked on to improve framerates, im out.",454.4
"game is very graphic intense, mechanics could use a lot of work on it. sound effects; footsteps, vehicles, doors closing, walking, reloading, shooting, could all use a lot of work. you just turn your guy around in a room and it sounds like he is running. the mods for this game are actually very fun though. i would recommend this game when it is on sale, other then that, the price is too steep for me. thanks for free weekend. battle royale mod is really fun.",75.8
"pros: this game is just beautiful. very photorealistic! when i first looked around in the game it was like whoa!. i can max it on my gtx 980 in 2k at around 40-50 fps, multiplayer allows a large amount of people to play on massive maps. the controls are great, you can have total control over you player. weapon accuracy is realistic, you cant hit anything without being tactical. it has a great training section that i advise you play before jumping into a server. cons: the muliplayer... i just dont understand. i admit i havent done any research on how to play, i didnt know i had to. i have not met a friendly entity in any game yet. as of now every encounter with another play has resulted in them shooting me, tazering me or hancuffing me to sell to another more advanced player... there is nothing you can do about it, both the faction and the police have simmilar procedures. there are, it seems, 1k commands. it will take a while of remapping for comfort and accessability, let alone learning the bulk of them. conclusion: it looks great and is the most immersive fps i have ever played. so get it! very taxing game on the graphics card. screen shots look amazing, but the 45fps is not enough to be competative, so i will have to turn down settings =( or buy another 980 =)",5.1
"very good its worth the price tag but make sure you have an amazing computer or you will be getting about 7 fps :p",312.8
"dlc has gotten worse, the game wasnt even complete when they launched it. i do not recommend this game to anyone anymore, if you want what you thought you saw, please purchuse arma 2 and her expansion operation arrowhead, i saw the arma 3: karts dlc and i knew it was time before more people get scammed!",116.7

"if you think cod or cs or bf is very easy for you, or you are a hardcore gamer that likes fps games, then this game is for you. it has scuba diving, grenade machine guns, artillery that you can control, even more realism, drones, ghille suits, immersive character customization, great modding community, no need to unlock weapons (you have to find them in the field first.) and even more! i highly recommend this for those of you who were in the military, those of you who have airsoft as a hobby or if you just like fps games in general. 10/10 however there is consequences. when i started playing the game (after the zeus free dlc was released.) i had a hard time getting past the first mission. but thats ok. edit: if arma 4 ever comes out, i hope it continues from the end of arma 3s campaign. it should continue from what bohemia interactive thinks is the proper ending.",228.5
"i only really play over/e poch, and from my experience its a great game. you have moments when helis blow up for no reason, or you die to stairs but when you look past that, the skys the limit, to building bases, collecting weapons, starting firefights with your neighbours, or making peace treatys. this game is great.",112.0

"while i do recommend this game, its only thanks to armas modding community. and well in advance. because, while there already are some very good mods and missions for arma 3, the vast majority of them simply is additional content ported over from arma 2. as for the game itself in its vanilla form: thumbs down. bad net code, bad design, awful single-player campaign, terrible bugs (like ai twitching when you hit them with your fire). technologically arma 3 is stuck in 2009. graphics dont age well, it already looks outdated, while being very demanding resource wise - bad optimization. unfortunately, arma 3 doesnt have any competition in simulating combined arms warfare. while every aspect of arma 3 is done poorly, its the only game that comes with all of it in one package.",620.5
"an great game which can be played in many ways. i didnt even complete the campaign as i didnt enjoy the parts where you start to command ai squads, but instead found lots of fun in the public co-op servers with semi-realistic team play. it also features one of the best online game communities, and because of some of the game mechanics, public servers are surprisingly enjoyable compared to other games. the game is not without flaws though, and especially in mp it is quite demanding on the cpu.",108.7
"personally i would put this game as m game of the year if not my game of the decade, the fact is even with its flaws, bugs and the perhaps not as optimised as it could be engine...i would still recommend this to anyone who has gotten tired of the average shooter, because this isnt one. arma has alwasy been a miliary simulator and hopefully always will be and this makes the game into something that no other first person game can top. the realism is brilliant and the combat stance mechanic is something fresh offering different ways to take cover, adding new ways to be tactical. not a fan of realism and seriousness? check the workshop and armaholic. you are bound to find something that will have you laughing, crying and having a blast. after all whats not to like about racing go-karts with heavy machine guns mounted ontop? if there was one thing that does bug me its the fact that rocks...tend to eat you sometimes if you get too close so be careful with that tl;dr version: buy the game or i will make a rock swallow you 10/10",392.1

"comparable to minecraft in its diversity and modability while maintaining a smooth and beautiful mechanic and graphic theme. endless options for modding but also includes a campaign and scenarios for people uninterested in mods. once youve played arma 3, all first person shooters seem to be lacking depth. i highly recommend this game.",757.6

"amazing, it is everything you wish they fix in arma 2 !!",40.4
"yes it was slow a litle bit but realiy fun i want to be in the army",16.8
"arma 3 is a good composed game. i couldnt stop playing since it merges you into a intense war atmosphere. it was cool getting into a car with a bunch of people and riding to kill an enemy group on altis life rpg (one of the many cool gamemodes). some things that you will need to get used to is walking and not seeing action for a while (which make those fights 10 times better). but if you want a zombie survival type of gamemode do epoch (which is pretty fun). also another gamemode is sandbox, which you go into a world with a bunch of people and test and monkeying around with the vechiles and guns (helps you get used to the gun physics). arma 3 is a good for 59.99$ when it includes 4 different gamemodes. also would like to state this game wont be like any other shooter you will ever play hope you think my review was helpful. (warning the game will crash your pc if you dont have the requirements)",12.6
"if you enjoyed arma 2 you will definitly like this one aswell. the graphics are really nice and the missions are awesome too. there are some nice mods aswell that will keep you play this game after you are done with singleplayer",103.8
"arma 3 is arguably the single most realistic and immersive experience you can find today. it took me quite a while to get it running well, however after its up and running you wont be able to put it down. the maps are insanely huge, allowing for intense tactics. the realism of the guns is where this game really shines. while some may complain that the kick is not entirely realistic you have to adjust the sights for distance. if you get shot even once you will either be dead or have an injury such as a broken leg which only allows you to walk. overall this game is a 9.5/10. aside from some performance issues this game is nothing short of amazing",49.5
"i like it and most of the times playing life mods. there are so many mods which you can play the will be always one fitting your needs and wishes. my favorite is rp life mods and i can still enjoy playing them. it has several single player missions which can help to get used to the game. as well there are several military mods, life mods, fun mods out there. i recommend this game.",303.0
"this game is great... although the mods are much better then the vanilla arma 3.. try them all. i recommend breaking point.. recently won 4th mod of the year 2014, and was the only arma mod in the top 10. its amazing.. the game is great but the modding makes it fabulous! good luck, have fun, dont read the bad reviews.. and get it now! there is alot of bambis on the bad reviews!",491.6
"a great game, includes lots of mods, you can join an exhilerating battle. you can roleplay your way the the top of a city or even an island. you can even use, and help your teamates in order to achieve victory. an amazing game all around.",882.3
"this game is good and all.. but its complete garbage. first of all its fun..... when it actually works... i bought the game for 40 bucks. had fun... but now i cant even ing connect to stupid piece of  server without the game ing about how its stopped working. if it worked 10/10. but its so  i have to give it a 0/10",67.0
"another great game in the arma seris, keep it up bohemia because im not tired of this yet! 9/10",117.6
"very good game, perfect resolutions, and nice settings, the game is fun to play, awesome, chillin with friends, but lots of glitches that needed to be fixed.",47.1
"this is one of the best military simulations i have ever played. the campaign is not bad, but you can download scenario missions which are user created missions. theyre incredibly easy to down load; you simply browse for a new scenario, subscribe to it, and you can play. its also easy to remove if youve completed it. this game has a huge replay value and youll never get bored. great job arma 3 devs!",197.7
"this game is so realistic, i love it. this is the game youre looking for if you search for mature players",199.6
"yes i recommend this game! it totally lives up to its price! you should play it because there is awesome graphics! i playing it and the is stratis life its the best life rp there is! so buy this game!",112.9
"continuing a fine tradition arma iii brings realism in combat to the greatest level. maps that are miles across with dynamic weather and day/night cycles (you can even navigate by the stars!), the best ballistics in the shooter gaming world, and every type of vehicle you can think of from tanks and helicopters to jet aircraft and small submarines, plus a powerful mission editor and decent ai gives you an unparalleled amount of content and replayability for your hard earned dollars!",807.5
"having fun in arma then i ran my car into pd bacuse guy with gun made me and i was arrest by a  named trey",82.5

"great game, hours of fun but you need a good computer to run it nicely",219.4
"very fun but you ned a crazy computer to play, also not a wide selection of cars wich is why alot of people deciced to play a3l so that they got a better rp emperience",206.8
"game with realistic battle but this isnt realistic. that has realistic only graphics and some physics nothing more. shooting and aim with use gun is ******. dont make more game with yours realistic. multiplayer isnt optimization and i can play only single player with stable fps. campaign mode is sometime nice but are some places where game is totally ******. arma 3 has yet much lacking aspects. game is not worth this price. 3/10",135.0
"such a good game, recomended to anyone into shooting games",179.9

"need to rework weapon damage models, but other that that this game is amazing.",536.2
"very good game, tho i ~have yet to find the perfect game mode to bring me here everyday. i will wait for a fun game mod to be made until then it will be a game that i just play now and then.",43.3
"this was for sure one of the best early release purchase ever. + great scenarios, open maps, logical and interesting missions, good characters, realistic weapons - really complicated controls and sometimes not so user friendly (but that will not disscourage arma fans) for people who dont mind spending hours learning how to play a game. its one of the best military simulation fps out there! highly recommended!",87.9
"absolutely love it! but wish it was alot! less cpu intensive. if you have a 2010 or lower pc with intel i5 or better dont even think of this game you wont beable to run it at a reasonable fps",200.9

"not what i expected but it was interesting and fun for a little bit",3.5
"i think that arma 2 is better. arma 3 lacks the atmosphere.",3.7
"the best war simulator there is. plus its on sale now... go buy it!!!",91.5
"a nice game thats worth its money if you pick it up on sale.",266.5
"really great game, or simulator i should say despite the many bugs this game has (which eventually will be worked out), its really fun(if you have a high quality pc if you have a low-end pc you might want to think about upgrading before you purchase it, its a real cpu eater.). one dislike i have is the over-rated, over-played game modes wasteland and altis life but it really isint the game more like the community itself, its sometimes hard to find a good realism game mode with a decent amount of players or decent ping, and more guns could be added too (which are) its quite annoying to have to download a mod for a specific firearm. overall its a great buy, well worth the money",73.2
"a very good game for those who likes action & shooting. 12/10 would play. i really recommend this game.",236.4
"really good game i give it a 10/10. after the heli dlc i havent been able to play it though it keeps crashing :( 0/10",855.2
"was alot of fun during the time i got to play it but it didnt run well i guess a i3 3200 and a hd6970 didnt work but now i have an i5- 3570 and a new gtx 770 im ready to play",5.2
"better than arma 2 , war simulator co-op awesomeness with explosives",216.7
"extremely fun military simulation. beautfiul simulation and great controls/gameplay. but the thing i love the most i altis life gamemode in multiplayer its one of the best thing iv ever played theres so many options to do whatever you like.",271.8
"this might be the coolest game ive ever seen. the possabilities are endless with the mission editor.",340.7
"an amazing game take a little while to get used to the controls but the campaign has an amzing story line and the multiplayer is unmatched.",875.0
"i have no clue what these game developers are doing. i got a 5930k 32gb ddr4 980 gtx x 2 in sli a rampage v extreme motherboard, and this game wont run much over 30 fps for me. i put everything on low, and still 24 fps. autodetect did something right, but still not over 30-40 fps. and its not even super pretty. the game might be good, but the optimalization just is so bad its insane. i wonder what graphics the rest is playing on, because this is . neither of my 980 gtx will go over 911 mhz either, while playing it. so it stutters, while not utilizing the graphic cards. i want my money back, its a bad code-simulation.",1.7
"still a few bugs, bouncy servers and could need a better server browser, but arma 3 is a very good upgraded compared to earlier releases, and one of the best simulators out there. the community keeps this up and running, and their doing a good job.",22.3
"do you really need my studip review to buy this game? just.. look at the screensots. 11/10",39.9
"this game crashes more than it did in alpha, i have never played a game where me and the people i play with have to constantly repair files because this game is still in such a broken state. you would think with the price tag that comes along with the game that it would crash way less, have less fps issues, and have very to little glitches, but what we have is a overpriced unpolished p.o.s.",180.2
"arma 3 is a top game, i highly recommend this to anyone who likes tactical fpss. the graphics, and gameplay are awesome, plus theres a whole lot more, like the editor where the only limitations is your imagination. play in other peoples creations what they have published on steam workshop. play through the newly added campaigns in single player. multiplay, coop, single play is up to you.",182.4
"horribly optimized, but still an overall great game. the new dlc update really helped with the weapon sway.",38.5
"like 2, except with equipment that would be too expensive to outfit all of todays modern infantry with. oh, and the swimming and underwater stuff is nice. it still suffers from frame rate issues, unfortunately.",57.0
"can you do more free wekends of free weeks please i love this game but dont have that much money to get it so could you do some more free wekends or weeks i really enjoyed them and may consider buying it one day",97.7
"before i bought arma 3 it had been sitting in my wish list for a long time! lets start with the obvious, it takes a few hours to finally start to get used to it and even longer to learn the controls. but once you know all that, arma 3 will be an amazing game that makes you feel like your in a real world situation. i cant tell you if you should buy this game because you should keep in mind its not one of your cod face to face pew pew kinda game, its all as realistic as it can be so it almost perfectly matches the afghanistan nato deployment! i remember sitting for 2 hours and a half in prone with a sniper and picked off about a dozen soldiers! if your into simulations then this is a game for you!",300.5
"amazingly well done game. awesome mods, no bugs, running smooth even on week pcs. i recommend this game for everybody",887.0
"cant play it it keeps updating nothing im stressed out",49.8
"i am really enjoying the altis life mod when myself and my friens are all online. king of the hill is a nice break for when you just want to enjoy a bit of fps game style other wise wasteland is also a nice mod that combines both the life and king of the hill but with no rules.",463.8
"probably one of the best games i own, everything about this game is great! 10/10 if i could i would  this game!",53.6
"great serious milsim game. lots of improvement in graphics from arma 2. the infantry movement is smooth and adds a realistic feel. without a doubt reccomend this game.",231.7

"best mil sim game out there by far! beat the campaign and have played it over and over!",357.0
"arma 3? more like ar-this  is not fun. i played arma 2 a fair bit and it was fun, but this game just didnt peak any of my interests.  the people who forced me to buy this -ma 3",15.1
"arma 3 does a good job at improving many aspects that were lacking in their previous versions. most notably, in my opinion, is the ability to dive underwater without dying. helicopter flight dynamics seem to have improved, although they are still not realistic. i would like to see vortex ring state (now implemented with helo dlc, thanks!), limited power during hot/heavy/high altitude operations, and a wider ability to slingload realistic loads (partially implemented in helo dlc, thanks bi!) into battle.",155.1
"may seam glitchy.... depends if youve played it then the glitches have practically been removed, if not then enjoy this master piece of huge! multiplayer is awesome not played too much of the single player but presume thats just as good. tip: read the many controls before playing otherwise... game over for you my friend. overall great game, depends what youre in to.",165.8
"spawned in a game, saw helicopter ready to go, hoped on and noticed everyone else did not entered. pilot took off and crashed. great game, just got to avoid the noobs and the .",69.7
"very good game. needs a little work with small graphical glitches every now and then, but very solid game. love the gameplay!",48.9
"just like arma 2, theres a huge amount of variety in gameplay with this game. the graphics are fantastic, although most people probably wont be able to run this game on full settings at a reasonable framerate. worth picking up, even if youre not planning to play it in the immediate future.",645.3
"a big open wonderful military sandbox that is made even better by its active and passionate modding community.",412.7

"i play this game to get rid of an excess time and self-esteem i have. it pisses me off to immesurable means and i love it. if you hate yourself and your family you should pick up this game and try the brilliantly crafted wasteland mod where you will somehow manage to break your ankle and then your neck on a stupid ing rock.",849.1
"best military simulation video games available. totally worth the money and time. chosen as 2013 best simulation game by pc gamer.",671.0

"a great simulator of my home country, alpacastan. i appreciate the correct modelling of alpacastanians, and there wonderful law-enforced attire of blue striped shirts, hats, tan shorts, and sandals. i also love the fact that you can recreate traditional alpacastanian picnics within this great simulator. it always brings tears to my eyes to remember the death of my grandfather, backwards cap guy- he was hit by a car, and then shot by a spy during the great cleansing of stan. rip, he will be missed. 11 frolicks out of 10.",44.5

"spent two hours driving over the bleak orange looking landscape of a  of an island",1.7
"digital deluxe edition buyers should get the map packs for free ,sorta disapointed",37.9
"i have to say that this is probably my favorite game of all time. im able to spend countless hours in arma iii and still have a great time doing so. there are gamemodes that everyone will enjoy and support for modding is pretty good as well. i would rate this game a 9/10 for its awesome action packed gameplay. while on mission there is hardly ever a time when im not on edge being aware that the enemy may be anywhere. whether you want to play arma iii as tatically as possible in a video game, you can. if you want to just play casually and shoot some bad guys cause its fun.... go right ahead you can do that too. i overall just love the game and play it mostly multiplayer because although the campaign is great multiplayer is where its really at!",195.2
"went from shooting guys in a battle royale to driving go-karts doing time trials",17.5
"its everything you love about sandbox games, mixed with everything you love about battlefield 3 but with everything you hate about call of duty stripped. buy it.",33.7
"it will take about 20-30 hours of playing single player to figure out how arma works. then once you go online, you will spend another 10 hours until you really start enjoying it. but once you get into it, there is nothing like it, and it will be the most amazing game you have ever played.",100.0
"i was hesitant to purchase at 60$ and i now regret not doing it long ago. ive been playing fps/tactical shooter games for 20 years. this is the best game ive played, its a sim, its realistic. get it you will not be disapointed.",130.2
"hell ing yeah, this game is so fun man. its a literal military simulator except its not too realistic but not too unrealistic. the gameplay is great.",94.7
"this game is probably the least fun game ive played in a long time. it tries to sell itself as a military sim, but its as much a military sim as minecraft. wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. also, 60 dollar price tag? games like red orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. youre money is better spent elsewhere.",7.8
"somone buy me this game and ill give you rust hacks",48.8
"man where can i start. this game has made me forget any other game out there (including bf4)...so many options and possibilities. after surviving a really intense firefight our squad made it out alive. we requested to be picked up and the nearest vehicle was a m939 truck i believe. we replenished our ammo and equipment and on our way to the next target our driver fell asleep and we all got killed in the crash...good times. warning: if you do not want to spend hours and hours playing do not buy.",151.7

"thought you could be a soldier? think again! arma 3 throws the player into a near realistic shooter designed to test the best of gamers. a honourable challenge to any and all.",50.4
"by far the best sandbox shooter to ever come out. the game is enriching and engaging, there is no shortage of mods and the game keeps getting better by cnostant developer updates and the community contributions. everyone in their right mind who claims to be a pc gamer should play this game. edit: the third campaign was a major disappointment, and with the modding contest looming things are starting to take a bad turn. this was supposed to be the best arma game till date and bohemia goes and destroys it...",103.5
"its one of the most accurate action/mil-sim game ive ever played. there is nothing else like this out there. 10/10",119.7
"we had a argument on who should be squad lead, we then proceded to teamkill each other until one of us gave up. then the gamemaster lost it and spawned in 100 diving teams (on land) to murder us all. then a entire batalion of tank squads, and 100 paratroopers above us to top it all off. 9/11, a true military experince. -a graduated navy seal",76.9
"one of the best games i have ever played. the amount of simulation aspects in it are incredible. and the steam workshop is like a never-ending dlc jackpot. 10/10",292.9
"arma 3 is a miltary simulator through and through, but unlike most simulators arma 3 has a campaign with in-depth story to boot and competitive mp thats more then decent. the ai is of a standard above what most games have to offer out there and each weapon, ground or aireal vehicle strive to give as realistic experience as can do when operating said equipment. weapons need to be zeroised and as per actual warfair artillery or mortars need to be given a grid reference (gr) before effective fire can be achieved; and you yourself can operate fire support weapons. the campaign is set into episodes and each episode has just below ten missions that offer a challenge in every aspect. although your ai teammates need to be babysitted somewhat and the game could use some more optimisation but thats a small price to pay in a game that is overall great. i score this game a 8.5/10.",38.0
"this game reall suprised me i plan to buy it soon and get the breaking point mod for it.",40.2
"probably one of the best fps, military simulator, with endless user add-on and mods i have ever played in my life. its to the point this game is the only one i still play. its far from call of duty and sort of reminds me of the old battlefield games but better. i give it a 10/10 not for the game only but the the continuous community and their mods.",376.5

"what the hell battaleye i got a bloody globle ban for what i did use any hack and i got ban for some resone what the hell in going on i use all my money for this and now i got ban for some reson what the hell",35.9
"good game. a lot like arma 2 but with better graphics. lots of fun although i think its still a little buggy. i dont think its worth $80 but it would be worth it on sale.",488.0
"i love this game so much. but you really need to enjoy these types of games in order to keep playing this title from behemia interactive. this game has its ups and downs, first ill start with the cons .... you need a beefy computer to run it. this game is really taxing for your pc even though on max settings it doesnt look that amazing. its only because of its huge map and sandbox gametype. this game also has a few bugs that you can ignore because it doesnt affect your gameplay. but this game is fun as hell. delviering realistic gameplay like you are truely in the army fighting, i suggest putting on headphones and maxing out the effects sound option so those gunshots are loud! this game gets really intense, because you know even one bullet could end you... overall i suggest you buy this game but maybe when its on sale. if this game sounds amazing to you, then buy it now. 8.5/10",58.3
"there is no other game like this one and its awesome!",466.2
"if youre like myself and enjoy a fully immersive and realistic experience in a fps, then youll enjoy arma 3. also, while youre at it, try it with the playerunknowns battle royale mod for true heart palpitating intensity!",183.3
"if you are looking for a ground combat simulation, then this is definitely for you. the game features a vast range of weapons and equipment. it also come with a powerful editor, allows you to create your own missions and scenarios.",118.6
"animations are more responsive, some of the new things introduced are nice, everything else is terrible. for the time being this game remains unplayable for me due to performance issues, lack of content, seemingly uncaring attitudes by the developers and a portion of the fanbase, and general disinterest in the story of this particular campaign. unless by miracle i find a monster gaming rig behind my house one day and major changes are done to the game and to peoples mindsets, i doubt i will return to this game any time soon. seeing where this game seems to be headed, i doubt any major changes are coming. im quite happy with operation flashpoint and arma 2 in the meantime and for anyone looking for a good mil-sim or just a fun time with your friends, i suggest you buy one of the two aforementioned games instead of this. edit: to clarify, i meant operation flashpoint: cold war crisis, the first game of the operation flashpoint series, which i believe is now called armed assault: cold war crisis.",21.8
"yes great game 10/10 if you like playing life mods such as altis life and playing wasteland etc.",614.2

"if say you like call of duty, straight into some action, then probably not the game for you, however, forget this games campaign and clunky  controls and go to the multiplayer, give say an invade and annex server a try, trust me, if you are to just follow a group of players, you are bound to have some of the best moments in your gaming life so far.",264.7
"for those who have played arma series, are passionate with military sims or are enjoying the lengthy(but worthwhile) process of winning, this is the game id recommend. although flight is not as good as the dcs, arma is a well-made simulator(thats right, it is not an arcade game)that simulates all sorts of experiences soldiers do during their line of duty. even if you dont mind your incompetent ai partners/subordinates, sp can be daunting; ai foes are definitely, even ridiculously, smart so you can be shot dead even if you make every precautions to prevent.(too bad our partners are not as smart). every variables must be accounted for executing a simple task. for those who just wanna play this game in a casual way, id really like to remind you this: you cannot be rambo, master chief, or cods protagonist or whatsoever to be winners, in arma. you are much more vulnerable than any of those mentioned heroes. you are in a virtual battlefield, you cannot beat foes unless they are really incompetent, un-coordinated bunches. regardlessly, for those who really want to experience what being a soldier feels like, id recommend this game. life is never easy, neither is this game.",43.8
"i literally bought this on sale two days ago for $35. wtf steam",1.9

"great game. in my oppinnion its probally the best military game i ever played graphics are outstanding but the multiplayer was disapointing when i got banned from 80% of the servers after only playing it for a few days . they wouldnt even tell me what i was being accused of and never gave me a warning about anything just random perma ban on most servers. very disapointed and sad because i was just getting into the game and having a great time with my new computer i just built to play it :(",52.2
"crazy good game. im temted to buy it but its a bit too expencive in my opinion (and does not fit in my buget). i was however able to get hold of it for an hour (free download event) and it was good fun and enjoyd every second of that hour.",0.8

"bad optimisation in the engine leads to fps lag, meaning you need a pretty insane rig to run it, even tho you shouldnt have to. has a lot less content than previous arma versions (not counting community ofc). i enjoy the game, but the fps issues (which cant be fixed because they have to re-design the engine) and the lack of conent makes it stale quite quickly. edit: due to some incredible community members, some missions are now actually playable. wasteland by sa-matra is very stable, as are some altis life servers. system: i5 2500k @ 4,2ghz 16gb ram @ 1600mhz gtx 660ti ocd with this, i get around 20-60fps wether its on low or ultra, it still runs the same.",265.0
"just finished the main campaign, it was pretty fun and challenging.",356.9
"i have the game downloaded, everything is updated, steam is being run as admin, directx up to date, c++ up to date but when i open the game in steam and press play it loads for a half second then does nothing.... this is getting slightly irritating because i have my arma 3 life application filled out but i cant get my arma 3 uid off of the game cause i cant run it. even when i run the desktop shortcut nothing happens. the launcher opens but other than that its not working for me. please help anyone. im getting upset.",469.3
"yes, i recommended this game, but its not that great. this is only my oppinion, to me the game is ok i guess, but it has a lot of bugs. also, its not that fun. the game would be more worth it if it was about 25 bucks, but nooooo it has to be super expensive. yes the game looks nice but it didnt change at all from arma 2. (again not worth it) well, if your into this kind of game, go ahead and buy it, don t let me stop you. but if you are not that into super hard core serious games than i suggest you dont get it, its a waste of money.",48.2
"very realistic and even my old pc from 2006 can run this! :) 10/10",120.1
"recommended but sometimes friendly ai are stupid and enemy ai utilize core i5 very well to take me down ============================================================================= ok that one doesnt have a good impression of the game so heres a new one, based on actual gameplay --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i heard an explosion. it was apers (anti-personnel) mine. teammate stepped on it? no one died. then? timed explosion? no. remote detonation? no. enemy stepped on it? theyre not that dumb. on a closer inspection, it was a chicken. a chicken bravely stepped on a mine to help our cause. 10/10 for unrelated npcs to take part in the war. at its own will.",94.4
"this is the best game i have ever played. it is better that gta 5. i would choose this game over any other game. if you dont have arma 3 then get it. if you dont gat it your a fool. 50/10 a must get",549.8
"alot like arma2, graphics and some very slight phisics updates. though these games usually improve with age.",165.1
"ran for barely a minute, couldnt run anymore. 10/10",249.6
"good game but with all the extra  steam does with batteleye its not worth it, atleast not for $60.00. youll get failed ticket, or corrupt data every 20 minutes or so.",233.8
"no other game is like arma. nothing will ever be like arma. you need this game.",645.1
"very poor design for new users, this is my first arma game and i found it almost impossible to play, there were no clear training missions and any that they did have did not give clear instructions. it took me 30mins of mashing buttons to figure out how to crouch :(. was really looking foward to this game as all reviews and videos looked really good, the multiplayer is very laggy and the players are rude and not helpful i was kicked 45 times, i counted, for being a newbie. very dissapointed will hopefully grasp the controls and basics soon just feel like ive wasted fourty-pounds. do not buy this game. i do not reccomend it.",2.0
"pretty good, i mean i jumped off a crate and broke both my legs but great experience.",40.6
"its a great game, i mostly like the rpg mods but thats just me, what do you think?",76.5
"warning, stay away at all costs!!! it is a piece of bs game that will give you 20 frames in multiplayer on your high end computer with all low settings. it has been out for more than a year and the game still runns like crap. take a look at all the improve fps guides and articles on the internet and you will see that the game is poorly optimized junk. or how about them my 5000usd computer gives me 20-30fps in multiplayer articles and videos? the game utilizes about 40% of my cpu and gpu and gives crappy frame rates (singleplayer works fine, this is just concerning multiplayer). the game is junk and from what i read on the internet it will stay that way, people say that arma 2 had the same issues and they never got fixed.",181.2
"arma 3 is a great military simulator which allows you to explore a very large map called altis and a smaller map called stratis with other players which leaves you fighting off the enemys who have control of the island. just recently bohemia servers have shut down due to steam buying out the bohemia and for some unknown reason, we arma 3 fans are still waiting for the servers to go online. it has been almost 3 months now and still no sign of the servers. this game is best when you are able to play with friends as i dont reccomend purchasing this game until bohemia interactive and steam sort out the server issues. unfortunately, arma 3 is going to be sitting in my steam library gathering cobwebs until the servers are back online.",26.5
"absolutely the best game i own. worth all 60$ of it. already have 100+ hours and have barely even dug into altis life alone. there is so much you can do in this game, and its all beautiful, because the graphics in this game are amazing. 11/10 would recommend to anyone.",334.8

"best game ever on lags a blt but look up vlds pn how to get rld of lag",9.4
"arma 3 is a good game, but it is still a work in progress. there are many bugs and glitches that will be punched out as time goes by, but that shouldnt keep you from buying the game. look at arma 2, it has become a huge success, mostly tahnks to dayz but its rp aspect. arma 3 is a truly next-gen game which is capable of doing so much. buy it, dont ask any questions, just do it.",2.1
"l love this game but the problem is l cant spot the emeny also how to aim but any way l love the game ><",3.2
"for an alpha the game is pretty sweet. a little too much like arma 2 for my liking.",12.2
"arma 3 is an amazing game with an amazing community. beat the campaign and the showcases? you can go over to the workshop and download some more maps. want to play a map made by you? hop on to the mission editor and make the mission however you want, and if you want to, post it on the workshop. the game itself has amazing combat mechanics, accurate portrayal of real firefights, and can provide hours of amazing fun.",164.2
"as i love to see games that have the great feeling of realism, this game brings me the most joy. it has some great weapon physics, hit-boxes, ragdoll and all the other types of mechanics. the mods to arma 3 are great like altis life, breaking point, battle royale and others. like i said, this game is really nice if you like simulators of this kind, and if you dont, go back to call of duty ;) <3 ~sadguy",59.2
"great game!! <3 love it so far ! my favorite gamemode is altis life and i never really tryed playing compain shuld i ? please tell me if i shuld :)",78.4
"i luv this game it has amazing graphics but there is one problem with playing! that is you need a group of freinds",172.1
"if you like military games , you should buy arma 3 because its gonna be best military game ever you heard",111.9
"an improvement over arma ii, but still needs work.",47.0
"tis a beautiful game. except when i get killed by a tank from 3 miles away on a hill at camp rogain or something along those lines. many different game-modes to play, and a thriving community.",112.8
"thought about buying this for a long time. arma 2 was great, but i wasnt sure if this was any good. if you havent played arma 3, buy it now. you wont believe what kind of situations occur there.",80.3
"its a good game. though recommeded for people who like to take millitary shooters very seriously. otherwise the fun side its pretty",821.7
"great graphics compared to arma 2. its a little buggy but nothing you cant bare with. if you enjoy playing the wasteland mod then its a good buy. just note to self the a.i. is beast, like they are hard af to take down. but the game is so beautiful. the vehicles are great and so is the inventory menu. you can switch out scopes between different weapons. overall a great game",44.5
"this game is stupid when i launch it it says invalid depot config help steam!!!!!!!!",60.0
"you think you gonna shoot  in this game? you dont. you walk, you run. this is running simulator.",185.4
"i have always loved the arma series and always will but here is my review. pros -great graphics -great story -workshop compatibility -easy to mod -great voice acting -great animations -great textures -visually pleasing gun models cons -poor optimization 100000000000000/10 would buy 5 more times",89.4
"best game ever! there is so much content because of people making addons, missions, mods all the time, this is like 10000 games in 1. best purchase ive made! only down side is that its in the future. i mean that they are using prototype vehicles that nobody knows about. it would been a 10/10 game for me if they just made arma ii with this updated engine and graphics!",613.8
"this is possibly the most realistic and entertaining military simulator ive ever had the joy to play. my absolute favorite part is the flying. the planes and helicopters in this game fly better than any flight simulator ive seen. i have only experienced a fraction of the game, yet im already hooked. creating missions is very fun, but it takes a little bit to get used to the mechanics. i highly recommend this game. 9.99/10",30.9
"this game is awesome. most realistic games play, i love to use the m14 and snipe enemies from a hilltip. the driving is also good. a few mods in this game and its awesome.",586.6
