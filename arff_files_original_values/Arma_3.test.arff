"i love altis life its like the real lifei love this game i allways have fun playing it its so awsome 10/10",194.4
"the worlds finest modern warfare simulator. pros: the infantry experience is sublime, with enormous map, beautiful and diverse environments, great freedom of movement and very comprehensive controls. inclusion of combat divers and paratroopers. aircraft, helicopters, wheeled and tracked vehicles and boats work great as instruments for inserting infantry and supporting them. real-world tactics works. great community, including a very comprehensive guide by dslyecxi. trackir is supported. a trackir is highly recommended, and adds enormously to both immersion and situational awareness. singleplayer campaign is competent, but i belive the most fun is to be had with user-created content or in online games with the milsim-crowd. cons: i would prefer contemporary military hardware instead of near-future. controls are optimised for outdoors action, and feels a bit clumsy inside buildings. controls on aircraft and helicopters are extremely simplified compared to dedicated flightsimulators. this is probably a design choice for reasons of accessibility, but the new dlc promises helicopters with more advanced controls. hope this starts a trend of more proper simulation of helicopters and aircraft. highly recommended!",137.8
"a3 is gorgeous. bohemia really did a good job with this game. for now i play the epoch mod & anticipate all future updates to both the mod & the game itself. would like to see more dlc.",376.0
"if you buy arma3... youre gonna have a great time.",475.8
"sadly i have to not recomend this one, so i got this game expecting hours of fun screwing around on servers, which didnt disapoint, however, that being said, it lacked in many areas. for one, the graphics had much to be desired, and animations clipped horrificly, no to mention the complexity of the controls. its not a bad game, but the graphics and such need to catch up to the content",7.4
"this game was fun has some bugs online but not to much with 3, more with 2 i cant even get online im stuck with singleplayer after paying all my poket money. but this game made me forget about it as so much better with graphics, and gameplay more involed and more adds, and updates as you play this game threw the years to come.",440.1
"to be honest, ive no idea what this game is about but whatever it is, it feels great! i didnt have much time to play yet, but once ive sat with it, i didnt notice how fast the time flies (6 hours gone like a few minutes) also, the multiplayer can be confusing at first, as there seems to be not much predefined game modes, but if you have friends playing it, its a must have!",123.1
"i played during a free weekend on steam. things i liked: realistic gunplay and movement. graphics look pretty good. online multiplayer in modes such as wasteland are very fun. basically dayz w/o zombies (although there is a mod like dayz for arma 3). what i did not like: while the game played smoothly for single player the multiplayer played not nearly as well. i would get around 15 fps even though i am above the minimum requirements. this may be able to be resolved with more tweaking or patches in the future. i have found a set of servers that seem to run pretty good however so i usually stick to those. from the time i spent with it during the free weekend (10 hours) i was convinced to buy it for the 50% off price of $30.",53.4
"arma 3 brings so much different game types to the table. from altis life which is a crazy gta online style clone that is better, to full on war simulator with ari, land, troops. there is so much to do in this game. if you cant find something to do in this game then you need to get to a doctor quick... cause you might be dead. :) enjoy.",131.2
"amazing game. well optomized. will run on a cereal box with 30+ fps on full graphical seetings. amazing multiplayer experiences and well worth the money.",58.6
"really good game. heaps of mods and game modes comming out all the time. this game is a great investment for the future and i think everyone should have it in there steam library.",489.3
"if you are looking for a more realistic military sandbox, arma 3 does it right. you can set up all kinds of different combat scenarios in the editor and give it a try in singleplayer or multiplayer. once you have learned how the ai wants to be controlled, it is pretty good. at least the ai can give you a hard challenge on the enemy side, but propperly used it can be really deadly on the friendly side too. multiplayer is best played in a clan where everybody sticks to the plan. but thats the same with most games. but now and then you find little flaws that make you frown. some of them are the players fault caused by lack of experience with the game mechanics or unrealistic behaviour in hot combat zones. but others are real bugs that will be fixed in the future. arma 3 surely has some kind of high-angle learning curve until you fully understand the mechanics. but after that you can have tons of hours of fun. most of the people i know have stacked 200+ hours. at least arma 3 is 10 times worth your money and absolutely worth your time. you should try it. and if you have problems playing it, ask experienced players for help.",603.2
"i love this game!!! its a very tactical, strategic and realistic shooter with tons of replay value.",172.6
"im not good at the game first of all and i dont know how and what it is about",302.9
"great game; i would love an rpg (role playing not rocket propelled) experience.",411.7
"its so awsome game love it different senario and its verz realistic",1.0
"only 3 hours in and so far,ive really been enjoying it :d",23.8
"this game is definently worth the money. with gameplay ranging from straight out deatmatch, wasteland, altis life, koth, and zeus, arma 3 brings a whole new style to first (and third) person shooters. though there are a  of bugs, in a way, it kinda makes the game. i have had so many countless omments just bursting out laughing at what my friends and i call arma physics, and i feel the bugs are usually hillarious. finally, dont play campaign. if you want a good campaign, buy something like cod. arma 3 has the most unique multiplayer experience ever, and playing campaign is a waste of your time.",280.4
"very good modern military simulator. you have a fun editor you can play with, with a host of different options for making missions, stories, and massive battles where everything is annihalated and you start the third world war. have you ever wanted to pilot an a-10 warthod and blow a tank apart with that massive minigun everyone talks about? this game... has the next best thing. nah, but it is pretty similar, and it is quite a fun plane to fly. make sure you have a decent computer before attempting the really massive battles with dozens of infantry and support units. the game also hosts a large amount of mods that come from a dedicated and creatively endowed community. i recommend.",73.0
"if you like dayz kinda action, and you are willing to rpg. altis life mod for arma 3 is verry cool, look up a good community and get your life going. get a job: pick apples, peaches, mine for iron, copper, salt and even diamonds. become a criminal, and pick, process weed, cocain or heroin. become a cop, arrest ppl. search vehicles, and hunt people that have a price on their head. you can even become a rebel. before you get a life on a server, read the rules of a server, the rules may vary on each server, if you want to become a cop, most of the time they want you white-listed. the server i play on the most: serverfilter: trinity join me.",279.6
"really fun realistic shooter a must have for first of third person shooters",43.5
"if you like buggy  that doesnt work, this is the game for you. thank you bohemia, for another glorious crapfest.",59.4
"looking for a chance to do whatever you want in a military environment? if so this is the game for you 10/10 would hit bush and blow up again ;)",635.4
"slow-paced and heavily strategic/tactical. its a game that may not be fun, but it can be very immersive and tries to give you a breathtaking experience. if youre one of those guys that likes hardcore realistic simulation, then this game is definitely the best out there. also its more than just a game, its a platform that has plenty of mods to keep you busy when the original theme of the game is not quite what youre looking for.",56.0
"had a sniper rifle once, missed every shot. died to a cliff. realism.",13.0
"7/10, has the potential to be a better game with time if it is still supported.",48.4
"rated one of the best simulator of this year, it needs some work, but mods help make it feel better made with the stock arma 3 isnt good. sure, it is the newest it still in development, i hope in the future they will add more vehicles and weapons",545.5
"this game... is 10/10, its super fun and their is so much to do, epoch, breaking point, arma 3 life, altis life, anything you want. and then not to mention but all the workshop stuff you can do. it is without a doubt worth $60",568.5
"this is one of the all time great games. it is a beautiful open world sandbox with so much content it is almost limitless what is possible. highly recommend.",403.3
"too advanced, and teamates will ditch you constantly. also many framerate issues.",111.4
"i was planning on buying this game for an huge ammount of time, when it was in sale last week i bought it. i mostly bought it for altis life, but then i met the amazing modding community of arma 3. i bought arma 2 for dayz and i felt really sad when there wasnt a dayz mod for arma 3 (except breaking point). after some time playing i saw that my friend bought the game too and we played a lot together. its really fun when youre with friends. the game is great and it is worth its money.",74.9
"this game fun for goofing around and fun cause it has so many modes and servers and big maps and good graphics",149.8
"it is so laggy i regrett buying tis game. ps it is full of glitches",1.7
"this game is such an improvement from arma 2, its graphics are amazing and it is well optimized. it is well worth the price and has many cool features and multiplayer gamemodes which is a normal thing for any arma game. i played 1 episode of the campaign, it seemed ok but the multiplayer is where its at with this game!",156.7
"this is great game very fun to play i mostly play altis life which is prety cool how everything works the storyline for single player is fine all together a great game",35.5
"arma 3 a good improvement more so than the previous ones, but the game still suffers from minor faults. arma so far is on top of my favorites list.",195.5
"bought this game for the mods only! worth it 100%. br + breaking point = hours of fun.",105.8
"really worth buying. you can go ride go-karts, play battle royale with friends, play breaking point with friends, play wasteland with friends. the only problem with the game is when you dont have any friends that have this game to play with. 9/10 from me.",55.9
"best game na such wow so yummy so much play time to fun wasteland is the best",244.2
"best warfare simulator out there. not only teamwork is a requirement but the knowledge in all vehicles as well as zones, weapons, pace & victorious beastings on all levels of your senses. this is not like cod this is not like battlefield this is a real time warefare simulator. (you need a pretty sharp machine to run this game at a respectable rate so be aware) 9/10",44.8
"this game is a simulator.. if youre thinking oh look, another call of duty/battlefield rip off haha, no. this game (if not known how to play) is worse than flappy birds, and is far from cod or battlfield. so, if youre looking for a simulator please. get this game, if youre looking for maybe i can get shot 20 times before i knife this guy please. stick with cod/battlefield.",8.9
"i really need help here! when i startup the game it freezes when i load the bohemia interactive logo and i tried all the standard methods of fixing the issue yet nothing worked. does anyone else have the same issue and/or know how to fix the issue?",31.4
"probly best military simulation shooters you could buy with out going into a real combat zone. would recomend this game to anyone!",109.9
"okay im going to keep this simple +graphics amazing imo + multi types of servers all fun from epoch to wasteland ect +amazing fun if you have friends and still fun on your own sneaking up on them and killing them all :0 +love the wep customization ect +prolly my most fav game on steam by far +never fully get bored of it all dlcs are 100% worth con but dont take these into consideration it still a great game -once in awhile you may notice a hacker -maybe the odd bugg but hay it dont ruin it completely",192.2
"sorry to say that but the game is running on a low frames and i just cant play the game normally ,its lagging and i cant kill anyone . ill not recommend this game from a minimum specs pc cause it will lag as ...",2.9
"war is fought by soldiers not the gun, it is fought by a ing tank coming down a road while you have youre pistol of doom. ps no pants have been harmed in the making of this game",192.7
"arma 3 captivates you and draws you in with its beautiful graphics and scenery. arma 3 has many different gamemodes from roleplaying an african drug lord to blowing the  out of a military base. 10/10 in my opinion",334.7
"for those not familiar with the arma series, this is a game unlike any other you have ever played. arma 3 is a wonderful game alone and an even better game with the mods to include breaking point and newly relesased epoch. this is a game that will never be uninstalled because its has constant replay value and every time i play it is different.",432.5
"i was playing it to see what it is like only to know how it feels to have a crappy computer. i shouldnt be getting fps problems. i was trying to figure out the problem. i was tweaking the settings, nothing. went online figured out they only use 1 core of your processor. i was really looking foward to playing this game but it seems the development team dont know what they are doing when it comes to computers.",20.1
"this game is stupid when i launch it it says invalid depot config help steam!!!!!!!!",60.0
"an awesome game with a great community, worth the money and more.",818.5
"the is without a doubt the next generation in an epic military simulation series",672.0
"-plays battle royal, survives hour and a half with good loot, gets in truck, drives into bush, truck stops working, gets out, truck explodes.- 10/10 so realistic.",45.5
"arma 3 is a good game and all that stuff but it the most glitchy and laggy gameplay in any game. one of the glitches is not getting into a vehicle but nonstop searching it for weapons so i had to give up a helicopter for that glitch. unless if you want to be realy mad at how you die in about 2 shots and have to giveup vehicles do to glitches thats fine but im sure nobody wants to die in 2 shots and loose about a hour of work getting guns then dieing from thirst or teamkillers / hackers.",14.0
"just dont cheat or use artmoney or youll have to buy a new game haha :/",83.1
"this game is super fun... if u really wanna have fun join the unitedatlis:altis life server. staff is really nice and they have a great team!",732.8
"even it is only in alpha testing this game is looking very promising, yes there are bugs ,but i at least am enjoying the game and looking forward to when it will be finished ....",597.6
"kind of glitchy but a load of fun and an insane amount of depth. if you are a fan of games with a good amount of tacticality, this is a must buy even at its pricepoint.",16.7
"terriblly brought togther game, completely garabage engine that just sucks up all your cpu and ram for little to no graphics. net code is worse then battlefeild, this game should still be in alpha. everything is clunky and choppy, dosent run smoothly, this is something id expect from an indie game, not wroth 60$ not even worth 20$.",3.8
"jsrs makes this game ten times better, oh.... and you will have to zero your gun to shoot that bad guy that is 600m away from ya.",156.7
"this game is one of the best ive ever played on pc. amazing player interaction and very realistic gameplay. this game took military simulations to a whole new level. definetly worth it.",305.3
"buyed arma 3, got an oragsm , ten minutes later i found out that it has dlc for 15 euros, had a seizure. 10/10 would milk money like cod and battlefield again!",30.0
"best military simulator out there for the civilian market. game is extremely moddable, and options and different styles of gameplay are plentiful. great online experience for players who prefer to work tactically and cooperatively with other players. as close as youll ever get to combat.",713.0
"there aint any horses in this motha a.  you and this game",0.5
"military simulation sandbox game.. its great with good content. if you find a good price drop grab it.",46.6
"jumped out of a chopper under heavy enemy fire, ran to a bush and hid, crawled to a rock for better cover, steadied breathing, eyes on enemy infantry through sniper sights, b*****d started running through woodland obscuring view, turned on infrared sights, accounted for gun sway and bullet drop, boom...headshot! 10/10",339.7
"this game requires a good pc my pc is a decent pc with a brand new graphics card and it is still struggling a little to run this game but, it is deffinitaly a good game.",50.4
"for an alpha it is great! cant wait for beta in a couple of weeks, and then the full release later. there are some performance bugs, but the freedom in multiplayer is unmatched.",11.1
"not a good game. its unrealistically difficult to aim and move, there is barely any content for players who dont play with others online, and it doesnt look that great. overall, this game is worth ten dollars, but if youre looking to play the modded version of the game it may have some value. i was looking for a military simulator, or a tactical shooter, and this is neither.",8.1
"great war simulation game ! i recommend it to all people who loves real action combat, but you might need a decent config for it.",9.3
"arma 2 - failed college and became obese. arma 3 - failed my life.",19.2
"this game is great for people wanting to fun a unit about military. you haft to use tactics lots of fun. but one thing about it is that haft to have a good pc to run the game.",941.1
"dont even look at the price just buy it, its to good to even call it a game. its a simulator .......",718.1
"brought game. played campain. got the hang of it. becoming quite good. shooting enemies as my team cheers me on. a friendly tank runs me over 10/10",1.8
"concept and everything else about the game is pretty awesome. only downside is getting 5-15 fps no matter what your setup is. if you dont mind playing a game with 5-15 fps then go for it. otherwise its definately not worth the 60 dollars, more like 20-30",69.9
"im just not enjoying it. i really am trying because i see all these great reviews. as a solo player it kinda sucks. i can see how playing in a group would make it much better tho. i love military sims but this one is to buggy and clucky and just not fun, for me anyway. maybe in the future, if i join up with some peeps it might make it fun.",52.9
"arma 3 is way more than a game. arma 3 has a vast variety of things to do in the game and it gives you an amazing feeling of what its like being in the military. you can fly a helicopter or planes, roll out with a tank or an ordinary car, you can use boats, etc. this game also has amazing graphics and it feels like your in the game. but the best part is the developers. they have made the game way better than when it came out, and they continue to do so. 10/10",90.7
"if you enjoy military simulators or survival games, this is the game to get, the modding for it is slowly picking up and will only make the game better as the years go on.",150.8
"if i could give this game 5 stars... i wouldnt... but 4.5 without question, this game is a tonne of fun if your looking for something way more realistic than battlefeild! best served with a squad and a large helping of patience... also expect many random deaths due to walls and stuff",323.3
"best game ever 10/10 ing sooooo goood the game is jsut just so awsome and so much fun!",156.8
"it is realy fun i recommend buying it there are mods like wasteland and altis life those are really fun",227.0
"briefcase flung me in air n kill me 11/10 wud buy again",81.9
"accidentally got a rus vpn version so i cant play the game d:",7.2
"fun army simulator game, although i play it for the rpg city life element. its also less buggy in comparison to its predecessor, arma 2.",164.6
"nice graphic, gameplay is pretty good. story/missions not so if you are looking for a singplayer game dont buy this game. all the fun is really in the multiplayer. a lot of different gamemodes and servers. singleplayer: 4/10 multiplayer: 9/10 all in all: 7/10",126.6
"feels more real than any other army sim game ive played",17.4
"good game, but min requirements are a ing joke! my pc out specs the recomended, and my friends out specs mine and i can bearly get 10 fps on any server. and he has issues with 20 fps. please optimize your damn game! i cant even play this anymore!! when it first came to alpha on steam i had easy the 60fps i wanted! i had not an issue with the game at all then it got ing rushed to release and all the fetaures that should come with the game are paid dlc, 16$ dollars for 2 ing helos? gawd damn! what is this ing ea? and sims? what next? running dlc? where you cannot run without the dlc? jezzzus. please fix this damn game or refund my ing 60$! - i do recomend this game, but take this as a warning! its fun, and nice to play, but please steal an alien space craft from area 51 if you want anything over 8 fps. - for those who ask about pc specs. i can handle bf4 maxed 120 fps. and such on other games. i have an amd processor and graphics card.",162.3
"very good game, maybe not worth 35 but i advise getting it when it is on sale! 9/10",105.0
"if you never played operation flashpoint, arma 1 , arma 2 , day z mod , day z standalone, or any other military shooter this game is not for you and if you have, this is the best military simulator ever made.",234.5
"a brilliant game but it does have its limits. i think that theres not anything wrong with the game but i can see room for minor improvements like maybe more maps like town and city maps in a forrest enviroment like on arma 2 so we can get the best of both games. i understand this game was only released recently but i still think that great things will come of this game. i recommend it to all my friends since the online features like the different servers allows you to play how you want.",154.7
"big learning curve, but super realistic. its a sandbox war simulator, so you can literally be or do almost anything! really good fun once you learn the ropes and find a good squad to play with.",626.3
"arma 3, the most universal shooter you might ever need to own. back in the old days, it was half life which everyone had to own, because this piece had plenty of content which you were able to play in so many different ways that its almost impossible to count them all. and arma nower days is pretty much the same, even if youre not a fan of great and realistic combat simulations it offers massive free content via its big community which wont stop generating content until and after the next arma will be released. but be aware this game is a hefty performance eater and it can cause you alot of headache, because of its bugs. but i have no doubt right now, that most of the bugs are wiped out and the rest is still on its way to be fixed. because this game really gets the love of its makers after its final release. theres still an addon to be awaited as well as a very nice dlc and im positively looking forward to it.",797.2
"i really enjoyed this game but i mostly enjoyed the multiplayer! everything about this game is just great but i would say its a bit overpriced! the community is amazing not like gmod which is filled with kids! 9/10",8.7
"good game, good graphics, flying cars, broken physics 11/10 would fly again",409.6
"most fun way to ignore real life with a real life combat simulator. 10/10 would be anti-social again",86.9
"perfect short-distance graphics effect & nice weapon mods,but distant view seems a little simple... prety much tactical options for players and much funny veichles , particularly the helicopters,and the karts! ahahaha somehow the multiplayers mode its hard 2 connect for that evry server needs sm  addons . and  cns internet,which makes hi ping.",98.7
"one of the best simulators ive ever played! a player has it all in this military sim! a first, or third person shooter(not like call of duty.)with a more expansive 360 degree of freedom! flight simulator with helicopters galore ,as well as aircraft! a knockout physics engine and easy to learn moding interface with true sandbox feel!!! use the editor to build yourself a custom mission and if you wish share it with the steam community via workshop. hear the crake of shots wiz by your head! you also get the best multiplayer experience i have ever had. with coop missions or, player vs player everyone out for themselves!! however remember that at anytime a well placed sniper round to just an ai soldier you didnt see can end it all at anytime!!! this is not just another game, its a chance to try to fill a real soldiers boots!!! arma iii, a great imersive experience!",95.4
"fantastic game! really great graphics and a lot of fun if your into simulation shooters!",202.5
"really good game, i recommend it to anyone who enjoys teamplay. note: it is hard to understand the game at first, however later on, ones you understood the game it is really enjoyable.",407.8
"dont read this. you will be kissed on the nearest possible friday by the love of your life.tomorrow will be the best day of your life. now youve started reading this. dont stop. this is so freaky.1. say your name ten times.2. say your moms name five times.3. say your crushes three times.4. paste this to four other games.if you do this, your crush will kiss you on the nearest friday.but if you read this and do not paste this, then you will have very bad luck.send this to 4 games in 143 minutes. when youre done press f6 and your crushs name will appear in big letters on the screen. this is so freaky because it actually works",754.1
"accidently touched a tree with helicopter and exploded to death. best aircraft killing simulator!",30.4
"absolutly love it great gameplay great campaign great multiplayer not much else i can say",176.9
"it cant run properly but arma 2 is optimised to do it, if the devs would put better optimisations on it would be a thumbs up",0.5
"really nice game. never thought a game could be such a nice simulation in anything :d",84.3
"this is a pretty cool games to play with friends and do some roleplay and coop",217.7
"a big step up from arma 2 game is much more optimized and the visuals are stunning. would defenitely recommend this over arma 2",55.4
"arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter, it really is more of a war simulator overall. it is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. the games strong point, in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer, where you make missions and what not. i find this single feature what makes arma stand out the best. more shooters should have the level of control arma 3 gives players. there were a few cons to all of its pros though, so i will list my biggest as follows. 1. multiplayer servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your fps (frames per second) 2. i feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players. 3. better single player. arma may be best for its multiplayer but i think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable. all in all i think arma 3 does the shooter/ war simulation best, it may not be as popular as games like cod or battlefield but thats not a bad thing. imagine if it was that popular, then we would be dealing with those guys...",16.3
"with the built-in editor, the community has made so much great content for arma iii.. with user made 1p/co-op missions, online game modes, theres always plenty to do and always more stuff coming out (cmon epoch!). throw in some beautiful graphics and an amazing amount of detail, arma iii is easily one of my favorite games. i highly recommend this game.",369.5
"this game is not in the least bit enjoyable. graphics are really good, but everything from sound to gameplay is straightout of 1995. its buggy, half of the features dont work correctly, and the community is absent. on a saturday afternoon there are maybe 2 full servers at best. i think this stems from terribly boring gameplay, you dont see another player for hours and the community is no help whatsoever. all they say is herp derp go play call of duty if you want something enjoyable to play save your money.",2.8
"fun fun fun...boom shot leg is broken...8/10 would play altis life again",241.8
"arma 3 is suddenly marked as a complete game, and they come out with a big dlc a week later? better idea, how about you suck my  bohemia?",10.2
"this is one of the better games i have played from graphics to gameplay. it has multiple new weapons and vehicles, ai will actually be somewhat fair and not use their wallhacks, and pvp is suprisingly good. the only minor flaw about the game is that the ai still have very bad pathing in some areas and that they sometimes automatically know where you are. while mods can fix alot of what bohemia didnt, its still a very good game overall. definately recommended if you dont already have it.",238.1
"its so much fun look at my game time and you will see why this game is so much fun the only thing is i hate paying for add ons thats the only thing which holds it back a tiny bit by 1% game is 9.9 out of 10 really!",216.2
"great game for multi-player servers and story, but mostly multiplayer. arma 3 life is awesome!!!",347.5
"seems like a good game i wouldnt know so glitchy it crashes me every 10 mins before i get a weapon!",23.5
"fantastic upgrade from arma 2, new lighting, animations and environment to name a few of the updated features make the game a dream. very fluid and vibrant, takes you into a futuristic war set however with the amount of modifcations available time-frame and setting varies. amazing level of access to scripting allows anyone to modify missions and the game in general to a tailored state.",109.9
"day 1: ran around altis with no idea what to do, got kidnapped, kidney stolen. day 2: found a car, gun and armor, tried to team with a guy, knocked out and got my kidney stolen. day 3: killed a guy for his gear, got attacked by 6 of his friends, kidney stolen. definitely reccomend this game",64.9
"my buddy and i blew up a tank, repaired it, drove into a heavily guarded enemy base, killed everything, stole a chopper and left grand theft auto: stratis",114.9
"for those who have played arma series, are passionate with military sims or are enjoying the lengthy(but worthwhile) process of winning, this is the game id recommend. although flight is not as good as the dcs, arma is a well-made simulator(thats right, it is not an arcade game)that simulates all sorts of experiences soldiers do during their line of duty. even if you dont mind your incompetent ai partners/subordinates, sp can be daunting; ai foes are definitely, even ridiculously, smart so you can be shot dead even if you make every precautions to prevent.(too bad our partners are not as smart). every variables must be accounted for executing a simple task. for those who just wanna play this game in a casual way, id really like to remind you this: you cannot be rambo, master chief, or cods protagonist or whatsoever to be winners, in arma. you are much more vulnerable than any of those mentioned heroes. you are in a virtual battlefield, you cannot beat foes unless they are really incompetent, un-coordinated bunches. regardlessly, for those who really want to experience what being a soldier feels like, id recommend this game. life is never easy, neither is this game.",43.8
"amazing game #runslikea great times had on free trail",116.8
"extremely fun game if you look for a troop to operate with. if you dont then its pretty much a waste of money. its a military simlulator, so it requires communication and a certain trust that no ones gonna shoot a rocket in the middle of the spawn base.",88.3

"this game was just too slow for me.. some servers are meh at best. the maps are so large and the server populations are so low, its a very slow experience. ive tried several of the game modes, which does tend to make for a different play experience, but for me, i like combat atleast every 3-5 mins in a game versus running/driving/flying across maps for 10 mins to get to the action.",10.8

"i have been playing arma 3 for the past couple days (with the free trial), and i was really concidering buying this game. however, even with all the realistic featues that i love, i cannot stand the fatigue and weapon sway system. after running for 3-4 minutes, a short sprint, or getting nicked by a bullet, it becomes nearly impossible to aim. even while focusing and holing my breath, the weapon is still moving to dramatically to accuratly hit a target at even a hundred meters with a scope. the army is trained to be able to shoot under stress, fatigue, and even injury. i myself have done 100 meter sprints, and half mile runs, then grabbed my ar immediatly after and can still quickly and accurately hit a man sized target at 100 meters. also, i only shoot with iron sights. until this unrealistic fatigue and weapon sway system is fixed, i will not be buying the game. honestly, what is the point of buying it if i cant even engage the ai, (who, guess what, can still accurately shoot you while injured or fatigued!)",1.6

"this game is absolutely beautiful. some of my best moments have been on this game, not only is the vanilla game absolutely brilliant but the modding community is also spectacular. you can play as marines, army, navy, whatever you choose. that being said, some further optomization is necessary as this game has major lag spikes and crazy fps drops, even in singleplayer. i have played for 300 hours and have yet to play the campaign, its great. if you are wondering what this game requires graphics card wise, i am playing with a msi radeon r9 270x which is a mid range card, on all ultra at average of 50-60 fps (on singleplayer). for a long time i was playing with a nvidia geforce 610 which is a low end card but wsa still able to play and had great expierences with. so overall, no matter what your specs are, buy this game. if your specs arent quite good enough to run it on ultra or high the sheer gameplay expierences will make you want to invest mor time, and of course more money on pc games. gameplay 10/10 graphics 9/10 fps 7/10 storyline (from what ive seen from others and from the few missions i have dabbled in) 9/10 overall 9/10 would play",819.1

"its a good game, it has its pros and cons. there are a lot of bugs, but those are not major, the servers work fine and there are a lot of dedicated servers. the game has a lot of good mods (rp mods, zombie survival mods) breaking point and epoch are my favourite. there are a lot of game modes and scenarios in the game. thanks to the steam workshop the game has a lot of features that you can add in.",411.5
"i am new to this game (never played any arma games before) and i have to say it is awesome! i havent really got into playing multiplayer yet as i am still learning the controls etc. but the editor is insane. i have just been creating small missions for myself to learn the ai and how to drive, fly, run, swim, shoot and all that is involved. i love flying the helicopters. the cockpits are so realistic and with my headphones on the sound is good too. some of the sound could be better but there are so many cool sound effects in this game. im coming from bf3 and bf4 and this is a whole different experience. rain, lightning, day, night, the lighting effects are so cool and i am just getting started with it. i have an nvidia quadro k3000m and can run at 60fps with quality settings. this is my editing cpu and i seriously might build a new machine for this game. if you want to run around and shoot people, level up, unlock weapons etc. this is not for you. i could honestly see this used as a training tool for military operators. it is the real deal.",502.6

"the campaign, scenarios and mods are fun and enjoyable. the multiplayer is unplayable compared to most games, though. even some of the best pcs barely get 20fps on some servers. its a known issue with the game and steam should warn buyers who intend to play multiplayer heavily. if you think youd enjoy a war sim in singleplayer then check out this game. if your pc is good and can run this game on high, it looks beautiful. not to mention there are plently of mods that continue to come out. hopefully the mp becomes more stable fps wise through future updates, if possible.",73.9

"i cannot recommend this game, mainly beacuse it runs like hell. i have tried the game on two diffrent computers (one with gtx 580 and one with gtx 770 gpu) and still very rarely get above 40 fps in multiplayer. and that is on standard settings. battlefield 4 on the other hand runs with an average of above 100 fps on very high settings (no aa though but 90 fov). i like the concept of the game and if the performance issues gets solved ill give the game another try, but as of now i have tried the game on multiple occasions since march 2012 and it still doent work. note however that while the game has superb scale and huge empahsis on teamwork - which is great - the core of the game is still far worse then any of the other major fpses. shooting in this game is irregular, laggy and the action menu is terrible. i really like the shooting mechanics in red orchestra 2 but in arma they are damn awful. flying helicopters is quite fun though and very challening (unlike battlefield).",21.8

"i have to say, this game blew me away the first i tried it. heres what i think of the game: pros: -realistic, if you get shot twice your dead, no regenerative health. -editor allowing you to create your own missions. -hard combat makes you think on how to complete said missions. -you dont always have to be the commander, or even fight. -multiplayer gameplay can be intense and make you think even more than against the ai. -makes you work with your team to actually get stuff done. -actual terminal ballistics. -booming mod community. cons: -hard to learn controls (if new to series) -some minor bugs (this will go away hopefully after beta, so im not taking a point away for it) i cant think of any more. so, overall, i give this game a 10/10. edit: just thought of 1 problem that affects a lot of people: optimization issues. new score: 8.5/10.",80.0

"been with the series since the original flashpoint. theres simply nothing else like it. its versatility exceeds anything else out there. wholeheartedly recommended",269.0
"arma3 is a good war game simulator i have been playing this alot and i recommend to buy it if you like war game simulators.",111.9
"this game is a perfect choice for those who love themselves military simulators. while this game does have its downfalls, aka its glitches, they however, are not game breaking. slow paced gameplay but not so slow as to get boring. i recommend that if you can find a clan, group, or server that is great and lots of fun, stick with it.",511.8
"singleplayer not as fun, very hard. endless multiplayer hours of fun. highly recommended, totally worth $60, snatch it up once it goes on sale for $30",879.7
"it was fun at first, but it grew old quickly. i purchased due to atlis life mod, and quickly found the lack of players willing to comply with server rules, made the game not so enjoyable. the large maps are nice and all, but too damn big for 100 or less people... i enjoy the realist consideration of the game, such as fatigue from sprinting, and its effect on aiming. overall, arma 3 does not have a lasting effect on me. some of the situations that occur are very fun, and memorable, but i often find myself logged in, running around in circles doing nothing. for large scale combat (meaning hundreds of players at the same time, in the same location), on maps the size of arma 3 maps, i would recommend planetside 2, which is a free-to-play game. the simulation arma 3 offers is extremely impressive, and quenches my thirst of rendering 360 no-scope headshot noobs useless. however, as a game, i dont enjoy it as much.",192.8

"this uniqe game offers a much much more realistic combat experince then any other shooter. call of duty and battlefeild have been left in the dust years ago.",1.1
"breathtaking graphics, fantastic gameplay, and a superior feeling to the controls since arma ii. the mod community are already blowing up on this. for those who enjoyed arma ii this is a must buy. for those new to the arma series, jump straight in on this, get moding, get building scenarios and i guarrantee youll never play cod or battlefield again.",26.9
"this game is amazing, even though it has some rather big optimization issues. i can deffinitely recommend it for something like the wasteland gamemode!",299.8
"if you are tired of just run of the mill shooters like i was then this is the game for you. all i wanted was a tactial shooter that you actually had to think about what you did before you did it instead of running and gunning and that is exactly what i got from arma and i love it.",71.1
"as a previous arma player i couldnt wait to see the new technologies that were going to be used in arma 3. then i played it. from a personal point of view, this game is a complete let down to the arma series. yes it is enjoyable in some aspects, but it is nothing compared to arma 2 / oa. if youre looking for a more arcade type military game, youve found it.",158.3
"this gotta be one of the best games i have ever seen",34.9
"recommending this game is a no-brainer. if you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism arma 3 is inevitable. the game wont let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like cod or battlefield. the best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. bottom line, go get it. its unique, in every aspect.",130.0
"altis life, wasteland, king of the hill, co op missions and much more for arma 3. best game played so far.",236.8
"i highly recommend this game to anyone who really loves fps/third shooters and anyone who loves hardcore combat! there are sstill glitches of course... the multiplayer is awesome. singleplayer is awesome. everything about dlc missions and the dlc packs are awesome! i also recommend this to anyone who loves arma or big open world games!",225.9
"this game is one of the most cpu demanding games ive ever played. yeah it has good gameplay and graphics, but they optimised it awfuly. and because of that the fps is bad and so is lag. if they would fix that i would give it around a 8/10. but for now its about a 4/10. i have a gtx 760 and amd 6300 six core processor with 3.50 ghz and 8 gigs of ram. so its not my pc.",4.1
"bought this while it on was on sale for 50% off. so far it has been well worth the money and i plan to keep playing for quite some time. so far i have experienced hilarious moments with friends and in online servers but at the same time, ive experienced milsim roleplaying and taking scenarios and missions much more seriously which is a blast as well. although there can be an fps problem at times, which i have not experienced very much at all, i highly reccomend the game. with the in depth combat gameplay, amazing graphics, and and huge mod selection, i cant complain much. highly recommended.",147.8
"a really great and realistic game but do not buy this game if you are not patient because you will have to wait alot of time for a enemy to shoot or to get a chopper, car etc. sometimes.",340.1

"nice game and very realistic ! maybe to realistic!",3.2
"this game definitly made my top list of greatest games. yes it may have some bugs, but the possibilities for the types of scenarios that you run into is just amazing. this game is not like any other ordinary fps. its classified as a combat simulation game, and it does not let down. so if youre tired of casual shooters and want to try something more in depth, then i reccomend this game.",527.8
"amazing game should try to add the stuff from this in to dayz. but this game is the best i have ever played on pc and i have almost considered play for a living",125.8
"this is just one of those games you just need to own you will love and hate all the bugs in the game but stupid part is that is what makes it so good. highly recomended",94.3
"absolutely the best game i own. worth all 60$ of it. already have 100+ hours and have barely even dug into altis life alone. there is so much you can do in this game, and its all beautiful, because the graphics in this game are amazing. 11/10 would recommend to anyone.",334.8
"great game all round. you dont need to be perfict at war games to have fun with this game and what ends up hapining is usualy enjoyabal. that is... unless you dont like the idea of massive scale combat across a massive map with land air and sea duking it out for survival. well... wether you like it or not... the game is great ecept for 1 thing... when arma started out a promis was made. the promis was to keep the game real. no fake and made up weapons and veicles. arma 3 broke that. but! the important thing is gameplay. and thats how it should be.",45.3
"commander mow head of lawn warfare: this is my lawn there are many others like it but this one is mine",127.8
"definitely a game for big kids, not at all your typical shooter. playing it for the first time wasnt easy by all means, but once you get the hang of it, itll be so much more fun o play than call of duty or battlefield.",151.3
"love this game... good action and pvp... base building is nice... only downside id say is the early bugs.... and if you dont find a vehicle... you run.... if you can make it past them 2 downers this game is number 1... like battlefield and rust mixed... absolute love",781.5
"quite the army simulator game, i recommend this to anyone who wants a fun time in-game with many options, other then the scroll wheel option being abit weird and something you have to get used to at the start its a very in depth and nice game focused on mechanics and graphics, recommended! :)",230.0
"good game if you can find the right people to play with look for a clan",307.8
"no decent manual available. the training in the beginning does not show you how to use the sight on the gun. so, the next step where you have to shoot targets in a field you have to hit one 400 yards away but theres no clear way how to use the sight on the gun. the cross hair on the screen is not accurate enough. wished it had a better manual because playability is paramount to graphics.",0.6
"when operation flashpoint came out in 2002, i was pleasantly surprized that the bohemia interactive studio creators of the game managed to finally make a military simulation that surpassed all other competitors. i still play it, but its successors, arma, arma2, and now arma 3 take this sim to new heights. as a us army combat veteran, i can state from my military experience that arma 3 tops the list of all fps sims to date. arma 3 involves teamwork, self-discipline, and developing strategy to defeat the enemy. this sim is not for run and gun players.",15.6
"this game is amazing its like 6 or 7 games in one....with all the mods you can play with this game makes this game so worth the money....never have i played a rp shooter but its so epic",679.4
"well for the time that i had to play arma it was very fun, but it is very damanding for graphics. after i had 3 days to play it i tryed to open it but then i got this steam update news with nothing on it and this came up every time so i had to uninsatall the game......",3.7

"a true life like of experience of war is to be had in this game certainly the conflicts of the middle east are encapsulated in the king of the hill servers. driving around in your 200 dollar rented pick up truck, not really knowing where you are going, you squint awkwardly into the horizon; then you zoom in with your scope because you realize you are dumb. seeing little dots appearing you suddenly hear the distinct crack of gun fire. being the smallest of the three factions you barrel out knowing the overwhelming s***t flinging powers of even just a small detachment of enemies. the gunner fires wildly as the tires blow out and the car smashes into a wall. he is now dead. the passenger attempts to fix the car whilst you take over the gun, firing randomly into the distance until the shooting stops the car is fixed, you are still alive. you make it into town and rendezvous with your comrades. the truck stops as an rpg slams into it, exploading and killing all inside. you are dead. you respawn and do it all again.",18.2

"this a a great game for some one who likes combat games, but wants a realistic system. i fully injoy playing this game. i think that it has somthing that everyone likes. people can make their own mission host their own games and even modify the game if they want to. if you like simulators like minecraft and also like first person shooters i recommend that you get this game.",120.1
"1-10 fps on medium settings, waste of money and time.  dlc pratices include sniper bipods and helichopter gunner slots.",29.8

"great game. awesome alternative to battlefield 3, if youre looking for a slower paced more tactical game experience. amazing visuals tempt me to lose track, and just fly around the map, to just explore. the main map of altis has over 200km of shoreline, with over 270 square km of map space. (arma 2, chernarus was 225km2) with the new lighting and physics added to the engine, night conflicts are no longer a pain, but great to play. ragdoll physics in the game are tastefully done, in my opinion. i recomend this game, the addition of the ease of modding, makes this game perfect to tailor to your perfect prefrences.",375.5
"i enjoy this for playing with my friends or just dicking around! picked it up when it was on sale for $36 and i would recommend that if you were to buy it you shold do the same.",89.7

"awesome game to play if you into military sims, but you better have a beast of a machine to run it on :)",13.9
"arma 3 is a great roleplaying game with amazing game mechanics and strategetic systems. there are many servers to choose from, but sometimes the community is not so friendly which creates the need for survival. the game is unique and is definately worth its price!",101.2

"awesome game, graphics, plot, multiplayer, player interaction, rpg, first person shooter... the only hitch that i got with this game is if you turn the enemy skill all the way down and your friendly skill all the way up, it still takes about 5 shots to the head to kill the enemy. i highly recommend the game. its fun to play with friends and build your own base(s). fly helicopters, drive tanks, airplanes, blow stuff up, you name it!",214.6
"awesome game! the realism and teamwork is amazing. although i was dissapointed when all the vehicles from arma 2 werent used in this one.",230.6
"im going to put it simply, so simply is one of the best games i ever played!.",92.5
"so within 5 minutes of playing the game i was approached by a player named megatron who offered me and my friend cocaine and $1,000. while high on cocaine a masked man came up and killed my friend. then some awesome medic in a helicopter revived him. shortly after someone kidnapped my friend and killed him while prenting to masterbate. im hooked.",25.2
"very well made, robust and fun game. the graphics are great and the game runs smoothly. the one thing that annoys me are the controls that can be some what overwhelming and clumsy, but they have made them to be as realistic as possible. they variety and freedom of this game is huge and gives a lot of room for modders to create great content. remember that arma is not a simulator, rather a set of tools that aim to be realistic and give a lot of freedom to the users and modders to do what they want with the game.",133.3
"i highly recommend this game for any wanting to see the closest thing to real life combat without actually joining the army. not only does this simulate real military tactics but provides an excellent window of opportunity for clans to really feel like they are in the middle of a war! friends can get together and act like the special forces team that they all wanted when they were little kids! you can even have roleplaying games and custom games such as cops and robbers! this is by far my favorite military game of all time! sure it takes a while to learn about the dangers of not going prone when an enemy comes by or getting major fatigue in the middle of a firefight but it is a simulator and by far the best one for military standards. i do not recommend this game for the call of duty & battlefield lovers because there is just no simple respawn or run and gun it situation this is not built for deathmatches! it is built to be a simulator that simulates real time combat for the hardcore people! there are no killstreaks/cod type loadouts/simple respawn or scoreboard. if anyone gets mad because this game is just a simulator i only have one thing to say. this game is not for you!",158.8
"im sure that i could spend a great deal of time writing a review on this game citing evidence and examples going over the pros and cons, but its not really worth the effort. the bottom line is that while this game is a beauty to behold its not really in a suitable condition to be sold. this game has a wide range of outstanding problems across all aspects of the game that render it near unplayable. the thing that really compounds it is the fact that bohemia seem more interested in producing go cart add-ons rather than fixing many of the debilitating flaws that plague this game.",3.8
"i really believe that this game is a complete step up from arma 2! i love it!",49.4
"very good team based shooter, tactics will be your key to winning in this game, one warning though multiplayer in this game on pub servers are super broken, find a batallion and this will be one of the best tactic games you will ever play, its also not very optimized you will play with your settings manually because optimization doesnt work",60.9

"arma 3 is a good successor to arma2 with some great improvements to the engine, visuals, vehicles etc. mainly i have played the wasteland, king of the hill and epoch (alpha) mods. king of the hill being the most rewarding and enjoyable over all. i have only just dipped my toes into the campaign, however i will be doing more of it i think. with all the improvements to arma, youll still get those good ole arma moments like clipping through walls/floors, and your vehicle exploding on contact with a weed or bush.",989.7
"while arma 3 is a good game, it is still has issues. myself as well as a lot of other players have experienced multiple problems while playing, one such problem would be when we are launching the game, a message pops up saying handle is invalid. dont risk your $60 - $65 on a game that still has issues. dissapointing... edit: there have been a few things that i wish to add to this review. i think it was a poor decision on bis part to add dlcs that cost money with little content. the zeus free dlc/update hasnt done anything to the game multiplayer wise, the karts dlc looks a bit fun, but still needs more stuff, the helicopter dlc only adds 2 choppers and a few new gameplay mechanics that should have been in a free update, which costs $15. also, like i have stated before, my game often crashes on even at the lowest possible settings. im overall dissapointed in this game and its just a huge waste of money that could be put to games that are actually enjoyable and not riddled with bugs and costly dlcs.",56.2

"i want to get it but dont know if i should please tell me someone.",39.0
"to be honest like all previous bohemia games arma 3 is filled with all sorts of bugs and unfinished / half complete stuff , however there is something unique about this game , something special that keeps people playing this game .graphics , gameplay, campaign are pretty good even though they could be allot better. even though there are other military sims that are not bad at all , arma titles hold the very top . why, you may ask ? its because arma 3 provides the user with the tools to create whatever he wants. you finished the campaign ? no problem , here are hundreds of user created missions for you that you can now play. you dont like the missions ? no problem , here is the editor in which you can make ur own missions. you dont like the arma 3 factions/weapons/vehicles /visual fx/sound/ai/realism ? no problem , here , download the hundreds of mods available for free. you want to create ur own content ? here are the modding tools , you can do / create whatever you want with them. and this is what makes arma 3 special .i am sure bright future awaits this game if the devs listen to the community and the community stays loyal to this game.recommended.",411.7

"if you need a tactical, teamwork filled adrenaline rush then arma is the place to be. you need to spend a long time learning the recoil patterns and even the wind speed changes how your bullets fly through the air. this game is not for the call of duty or battlefield player who just likes to run and gun. there are lots of places to explore in the map because its so big but in a gamemode like domination or king of the hill, youll be deployed to one area only so it will be a close engagement in that place only. lots of workshop content to keep you busy after that campaign is over but the muiltiplayer is where its at. 9/10 - only for the hardcore military player who loves teamwork and long engagements.",89.8

"fell off two story building, broke my legs crawled for half an hour and begged to be killed. finally someone granted me mercy and shot me in the head - 10/10 would do again",111.8
"this game is a gorgeous achievement. the environments are beautiful, runs unbelievably well and content isnt bad. i loved operation flashpoint, and compared to ofp, technically anyway, arma 3 blows it out of the water. it seems to contradict its self however: once all the great, well polished and fitted pieces are put together, you get something not only worse than the first generation, but so bad as to be unusable. if the idea was to make a realistic military first person shooter, than this can be labelled as nothing less than a failure. not only that, but the fact that representatives of the dev team on the publishers forum refuse to listen to suggestions for playability adds salt to the wound. the fact that i bought arma2 just before support was removed and arma3 was released adds lava and acid to the same wound. ive been a gamer for 25 years, and have seen everything from masterpieces to unfinished games released as such, but loading up a game and knowing i will leave frustrated, angry and feeling cheated is completely new. bohemia has lost my support.",41.8

"beautiful, probably the most realistic militarian simulator to date. got shot once in a certain spot, and youre dead. lots of wandering, plenty of challanges, just an over all fun game if you take the day to figure out how to play it. does take time to figure all that out though, nothing like battlefield. can be a lengthy play at times.",90.9
"stop looking at the reviews and just buy the game already.",133.4
"while there are still a few bugs, it really is a great game, much better than arma 2. highly recommended!",113.8
"i cant complain, this game delivers on what i was exspecting. i have all other games in the arma series aside from a small few of the arma 2 expansions. i love the ballistics, you get a more realistic feel for how a real firearm operates. there is much more to take into account than your simple fps. the series is great and worth a try, the controls can be intimidating but they are managable if you invest some time in training and getting a feel for it. this is a simulator so things are gonna be alot tougher than your typical war game. the ai friendly ai could use some more fine tuning and tweaking, i have had to put a few bullets into a couple insubordinate ai team mates for laying fire on targets a 1000 meters away thus helping bring more aid and attention to the base we were originally assaulting. the game is not without its bugs, and it is also a heavy on your processor much like arma 2 was but indeed it is definatly a step up in graphics. it could use a larger armory, but there is a great mod cummunity that works on things like that to help the process along. cant wait to get my saitek x55 rhino pro h.o.t.a.s. to be able to enjoy the helicopters alot more.",173.4
"*for what it has to offer, this game is amazing. being able to accept foreign content is a huge plus! the game itself is amazing! never before have i experienced anything like arma 3. i highly recommend this game to anyone interested in realistic combat and not that c#ck of duty sh#t. for christs sake, there are hundreds of mods out there that transform arma into a whole new game! *there is the epoch mod!  apocalyptic simulator. *there is the breaking point mod! (my personal favorite) it pretty much kicks dayzs . it is everything dayz wanted to be, but couldnt. i have never in my life actually got an adrenaline rush from a video game such as the one i get from this one. when you hear the crack of a bullet whiz over your head, you know you are probably gonna die. and the players on breaking point are ruthless to say the least! you can think that you are best buddies with another player, then they will turn on you in a heart beat. i mean really you can even pretend to be a zombie! it is insane! *there is also some sort of dinosaur mod out there! *this game has so much potential that it makes me wonder why not everyone has adopted it yet. *get a part time job, buy arma 3! then quit the job, and play arma 3! it is that easy!!! *very great game!",629.5

"controls are sloppy and placed terribly.the search for realism has gone to far.btw bohemia we are not actually there to hear where the shots are coming from,and when 1 of 10 guys say enemy front idk wich direction to look.wtf minimap maybe?and most of all since when does a marine run 150 meters before he has to stop from exaustion.this is terrible!!!and finally multyplayer? this is the worst part of the game,not because its difficult but because there is little to no game organization.people just run around with no objective.its all sandbox.and then they add an indipendent team?you never know who to shoot.if you decide to shoot more than 30 meters make sure to rest for 20 min. before you shoot or you will have a gun waving all over the sceen.this game looks and sound awsome but folks im afraid it is a huge waste of money :(",272.0
"for me is this the most realistic game ever! campain is less boring than in flashpoint and previous arma series. for me is main editor. you can create what you want. you can make funny scenes etc. this game is really originally and one of few games what are good for buy. authors are looking after this game -> thats next reason. this is not wasted many !",100.1

"this is not your typical shooter, it is more of a simulation game with firefights usually at football feild lengths away unlike the close quarter battles in cod or moh. this is not a shooter with tightly scripted fights and cynimatic bravado, it is a sandbox game in the truest sense of the word especially with the games support of the mod community. if you have basic scripting knowledge or patience then the game opens new possibilities with the fantasic mission editor that alows you to set up single and multiplayer firefights in minutes. lastly the multiplayer is fun though i find multiplayer is better at a smaller scale with friends on custom missions though if you can get into a warefare game it is a lot of fun playing a large scale realistic rts/fps.",126.4

"what has made this series so popular is the ability to mod it. the game by itself (talking about arma 2 and arma oa) are terrible games, but i have 100s of hours playing the modded versions of them, particularly the ace mod. since ace is not out for arma 3, and no sign of when it may come out, i cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anyone. the arsenal available in vanilla arma 3 is miniscule, and they have recycled a lot of graphical stuff from arma 2, making this worthy of the $20 shelf, not the current $60 price point. in summary, with ace out i would pay $60 for arma 3 today. without ace, only 2 maps, 2/3 of a campaign out, and no real game improvements coming from bohemian i would wait until this game gets to $19.99. update 22 july 2014. i can finally recommend this game again, since there are enough mods out there to once again make this game great. bi makes a poor game, the modding community makes it into a great game. while ace is still not out, there are other mods coming forward such as agm that make this game great. the weapon sway is completely broken without mods. as of this writing it is still $60, which is more than i would pay. pick this up on a steam sale for $30 or less.",323.0

"arma (3) is not the typical shooter you would imagine. it is way more then that. the really cool thing about arma is that its trying to simulate a real war scenario. that does not really work obviously , because its a game. the reason why i still recommend this game to everyone , is because it is still a really well made game. the amount of time , fun , effort , realism , roleplaying and strategy you can put in this game is endless. people always come up with new and really cool scenarios like sniping , infantry combat , underwater combat , mechanized infantry combat , air combat and so many more things you can put in front of combat :p :d. turning that around , you also have a really good editor to develop your own missions and scenarios. this game is awsome , and everybody whos looking for something new and good : take it! :)",25.8
"was flying a full ghosthawk the other day taking some guys to an ao. i wanted to stay safe so i checked the map and marked an lz that would block visuals of me via the trees that were in the area. i head out and keep myself low when we get close. im about 10 feet off the ground when tank rounds start hitting the side of my chopper. im hearing beeps and  in my head and my anti-torque rotor was out so it threw us into a spin. i switched to thirdperson to see if i was going to hit a tree or not and all i saw was dead guys pouring out of the other side. im finally on the ground and im knocked unconscious. as my screen flashes in and out, i see machine gunners throwing hundreds of rounds in all directions while three guys revive the ones that didnt die on the ground. as the guy that dragged me out brought me back all he said was inb4 dangerzone you wont get that rush from any other game. i would definitely reccomend, holy  does it get intense.",258.4
"arma 3 is a great military simulator which allows you to explore a very large map called altis and a smaller map called stratis with other players which leaves you fighting off the enemys who have control of the island. just recently bohemia servers have shut down due to steam buying out the bohemia and for some unknown reason, we arma 3 fans are still waiting for the servers to go online. it has been almost 3 months now and still no sign of the servers. this game is best when you are able to play with friends as i dont reccomend purchasing this game until bohemia interactive and steam sort out the server issues. unfortunately, arma 3 is going to be sitting in my steam library gathering cobwebs until the servers are back online.",26.3
"it was severely rushed, put into beta when it should have been alpha and even after release i cant say it would even be called a beta. still the game is being constantly updated but it was released as full without a campaign, its being currently worked on and added to every few months. glitches and not what i expect from arma in its gameplay, despite being in the future i do prefer the previous version more. although with it being consistantly updated and steam workshop is full of user made content giving you more options with the games current state.",271.6

"this is my first review. arma 3 is one of the most realistic military sim youll play in awhile. the realism beats battlefield, but is slower. at first if youre not use to it you will wonder how you died. after awhile you will realize that you were shot around 500 meters away. arma 3 is for the players who want more realism than battlefield.the game has many positives and some negatives that i can note. positives: + amazing graphics in some places + big maps (2 really big islands, with one about 270km squared) +a decent amount of vehicles / weapons +alot of uniforms for player customization (using the virtual ammo box, that is present in some servers) + a very good editor and a real time edior named zeus + life like situations with other players + no annoying kids like call of duty negatives: - the campaign does not have a story that leaves an impression - the ai downright has no iq - needs a good computer - the map though big in some places are really just open land - hard to learn the game has its shares of positives and negatives, but will not be like any other game youve ever played. dont buy this game if you wont take the time to learn how to play. that is because it will overwhelm you if you perfer games like call of duty.",249.8
"still early days for me yet as i am still learning, but what i have seen from this game so far is nothing but awesomeness... vast landscape - the map is absolutely huge... some players end up having a full time job air lifting people to the hotzone and then back to base and pick up the next lot of soldiers... the graphics - are absolutely spectacular the sound - is amazing, really is an immersive experience realism - the most realistic military game i have ever played... if you are a call of duty fan... forget it, get out of this page and do not buy this game... you cannot go in guns blazing, you cannot even run from cover to cover without getting puffed out in which causes you to lose accuracy... battlefield players that feel that battlefield just doesnt have enough realism, you may appreciate this game as i am an ex-battlefielder and i love this game... the bad - extremely hard... and there are soooo many buttons to remember, but practice makes perfect... 9/10 - it loses a point because you cant just pick it up and play, it requires lots of time, practice, patience and discipline.",22.6

"so much war action simulation buttons dx... i love it.",50.7
"arma 3 is probably the best game ive played on pc. this milsim sandbox, although incredibly fun and addictive, it is also incredibly frustrating. since its a simulator there are many things you have to learn in order to do the most simple things. but, with its incredible detail and loads of items youll probaly spend the first few hours looking at all the different guns or crashing a helicopter a few seconds after you get in it. this may seem like the game is too hard for anyone to play but trust me, after a while youll get really good at it and feel proud for some reason. this game has so much to offer with all of its combat scenarios, and with the surprisin amount content you can mess around with, it truely makes it my favorite game. 10/10",346.1

"it must be said again and again: the arma series is not compareable to any cinematic driven, action packed shooters! and if you dont like teambased multiplayer, you wont get too much fun out of it, since the singleplayer campaign seems to be more like an extra. this said, the third armed assault gives you everything you need for the most realistic and intense battle experience possible! you might complain about the near future setting, which made it even harder for me to leave my beloved chernarus (arma 2) behind, but you wont stumble over pulse rifles et cetera. furthermore youll get a huge sandbox world, an editor to do in it whatever you want and a fine community that never sleeps! so, what else should i recommend right now? buy it! dont wait for more content and lower pricing, the war has already begun! edit: best game ever! =)",771.5

"when i got arma 3 i was a little worried that this game would not be for me. but after putting over 200 hours into the game, i can safely say this game is an amazing video game and highly recommened it to any call of duty players as my self looking for a new way of looking at war games. arma 3 provides so much along the line of the base story, super fun multiplayer games, and also an awesome editor system. some things i suggest doing if you buy this game is finding a group of people to play with. because although this game is great by its self, it is much more fun with freinds. i have met alot of great people on this game that i play with constanly. another thing i suggest you do in arma 3 is try out the editor. you can make some really cool stuff with it. i have made around 6 missions that i can play with my freinds whenever i want to. now i am not going to lie there are some bad things about this game as well. for one multiplayer can get a little stupid sometimes along the lines of, well other players. there is also the glitches that pop up now and again. and if you really want to have fun in this game you better have some good internet connection and a decent computer. but all in all this game is pretty darn good and i highly recommend this game to war game gamers.",264.5

"this game is absolutely fantastic. it really shows how bogus cods and mws claims of realism are. i would recommend this game to anyone who is sick of the spunkgargleweewee that the modern shooter has turned into. i would not recommend this game to anyone who lacks patience, because, like real life combat, there are many times that you arent shooting at someone, but are instead using tactics and stratagies involving the tarrain to get the advantage.",81.9

"the first thing i would like to say is that this game runs better than arma 2. also grapics is great. but what i miss are 2-3 body hit kills, forests (i just need them, i hate playing in desert areas) and also bullets seems to fly very slowly (compared to arma 2). however i dont think this game worths 45e, it has price of 30-33e",176.9

"$16.00 us for 2 bad helicopters, or to even be able to sit in the back seat of one no content no shotguns buggy like every other arma game realistic military/war simulation, helicopters and planes explode when they touch water. impossible to try and survive a crash landing even if you are hovering and descending 2 mph most  admins on any server its fun i guess.",304.0

"buy it and start with the battle royale mod (which is excellent for both solo and coop play) if you like super tactical shooters with roaming like far cry/crysis games. the map is 270 km2 and super varied so the encounters are always different. ive played 110+ hours and i still havent seen everything on the map. i experience immersion in this game like nothing else i have played for a long time. there is a lot of potential in the mods. the value is good because its future proof due to mods and updates. you can really stress out your high-end rigs with this game, and the optimization isnt terrible - it runs better than arma 2 and dayz. i tried the game with a 7 year old rig and it was playable. the game is pretty much reliant on mods so you should be prepared to install some, they are easy to install though the game is definitely not bug-free at this time, and the physics are questionable. youll get stuck inside rocks and walls, shoot invisible obstructions, and die some unfair deaths. the controls are also really technical, so it is best for hardcore and patient players, maybe as an evolution from battlefield-like games",719.8

"so. this is one of my favourite games of all times, since arma 1 and cnc commanders was released. people are complaining about the missing campaigns, being impatient and just douching all over the place because its not a cod. this game is just like the best milsimulator ive ever played, right after arma 2 oa. bohemnia interactive did a very fine job. it has bullet penetration. the soldiers are highly customizable and damn... it is even supporting mods and encouraging people to create stuff. if you want a real multi-player and fps capable game, please buy this. its just amazing. graphics and gameplay is o-u-t-s-t-a-n-d-i-n-g. arma 2 needed an additional mod, called ace, this game here, does not even need any more realism mods, because it is realism itself! worth the money. fun to play. 9.5/10 -acekiller.",291.1
"i am new to this game (never played any arma games before) and i have to say it is awesome! i havent really got into playing multiplayer yet as i am still learning the controls etc. but the editor is insane. i have just been creating small missions for myself to learn the ai and how to drive, fly, run, swim, shoot and all that is involved. i love flying the helicopters. the cockpits are so realistic and with my headphones on the sound is good too. some of the sound could be better but there are so many cool sound effects in this game. im coming from bf3 and bf4 and this is a whole different experience. rain, lightning, day, night, the lighting effects are so cool and i am just getting started with it. i have an nvidia quadro k3000m and can run at 60fps with quality settings. this is my editing cpu and i seriously might build a new machine for this game. if you want to run around and shoot people, level up, unlock weapons etc. this is not for you. i could honestly see this used as a training tool for military operators. it is the real deal.",502.6
"im a huge fan of the series (since the good old operation flashpoint), but now im hugely disappointed by what public multiplayer has already become! arma was a military simulator aimed for those who like the genre, 90% of public servers today are rpg. for me altis life is the plague of arma... there needs to be a forced filter to remove them from the server browser. to get that real arma experiance nowadays you need to play with friends or join a group/clan... no way to get the real arma experience on public servers. (sorry for my poor english)",426.0

"trained soldier jumps over wall, drops 3 feet, dies. 10/10 for totes realism. srsly tho, i had competetive jumping off  w/ my friends when i was in 3rd grade and dropped farther.",22.8
"i would say that the best way to describe arma iii would be to say that it sends you to war. be it through having your helicopter shot down in the first five minutes of you being in the game, and ejecting just in time to avoid death, then crawling to an outpost on your broken legs, to defend it to your death, or be it in having your humvee hit by an rpg and having your commanding officers head shot off by a sniper. the game is what you make it, but i will say this. this is not a casual game by any means. if you are a fan of games like cod or bf you will not be happy with this game. the hyper realism makes it often incredibly challenging to survive, but i can say from experience that when you do succeed, you will be as excited as ever. i would reccomend most players to start out playing online, because that is where most of the fun is. the multiplayer modes and the variety of them make a nearly infinite replay value. the games sandbox nature make it a blast to play with friends, though it does lose something when playing alone. i would reccomend playing with friends. i give it a 8/10.",139.4

"the game is fun if you know what you are doing, if you know how to press 5 keys in about 1 seconds time then you will have no problem with the controls. there is a large learning curve when it comes to people coming from games like tf2 or counter-strike. you have to be tactical, and that is what defines the series as a whole. but for $60 i would recomend waiting for a sail even though there is plenty of content to have grounds for a purchase.",2.3

"great gameplay, great visuals, sounds, and the two new islands are frankly wonderful and huge. in my opinion the most noticeable improvement since arma 2 is that we are now evolving into some realistic and visually credible open world, as opposed to the narrow places kinda looking like more or less similar checkpoints in previous games. the gameplay adjusts extremely well to the new terrains, making arma 3 something closer to an actual simulation than just an advanced fps with milsim elements into it. however, it is impossible to talk honestly about arma 3 without telling what hurts most: the lack of vehicles (planes notably, but not only), the lack of weapons and few annoying ai pathfinding issues (sometimes even on places where all should normally go well). that being said, i personally can see an insanely great potential behind arma 3, and the way it will continue to evolve will in my opinion probably make it simply one of the best game ever created. all it needs is some more time to grow up.",877.5
"i recommend this game to all army fans out there, but 1 thing you have to keep in mind, very big game, you need a very good computer to run it. i warned you... final rate on game= 9/10 (needs more fps) community for this game is just fan--tas--tic... everyone is helpful and game is heaven for teamwork gameplay, il be honest, i get the chills when i play it.. -- gives you goose bumps -- -tytomgaming",428.7

"cant say enough good about this game, so much more fun than the run and gun games. i enjoy making missions and playing them with my friends, the mod community has to be one of the best ever... other than some bugs here and there which i know the game is constantly being improved upon makes it one of my favorites, if you are tired of the generic run and gun shooters and want a game that actually makes you have to think , ammo count, health, team members, this is the one. i got tired of the others. (wont mention their names ) they kept tweeking them and wrecked the games for me. so you could say i got tweeked right out of them. i am a little over a half century old and have been gaming for many many years. the operation flash point days were a blast, and to see this evolve into what it is today is just great. if i could add anything to this game, it would be the ability to jump, and maybe a flame thrower tank. and the ability to put c4 on a small drone :) i recommend this game for fun",406.2
"mechanically, arma 3 is outstanding, with controls that are smooth while still portraying the weight of a human body. weapons feel great and firefights remain intense both against ai and other humas. atlis is an impressive map with each square kilometer offering interesting options for firefights. the first two episodes of the campaign are good, and there are some great mods and modes already showing up like breaking point and the universal war sandbox. it also happens to be the best looking open world game around in terms of sheer realism. im genuinely excited to see how this game develops in the coming years.",115.5

"this game is pretty epic and i would recommend this to anyone who has time on their hands and who like playing shooters with strategic gameplay. however, do not buy this, or waste time buying this if you dont have an intel cpu. this game destroys your cpu if its anything other than intel, and if you proceed with this, you will suffer. just make sure you have a good gpu aswell. i have an amd cpu and a r9 280 x toxic, and it runs fine in single player (50-60 fps with everything maxed, distance tweaked a bit), but its terrible with online multiplayer, not the rendering part, or the calculations made by the cpu in normal battles, but if someone decides to use any sort of explosives, my computer laggs the f- out. again, dont buy unless you have an intel (4th gen ofcourse)",216.3
"tons of bugs, the ai is horrible, the enemy ai can shoot your  off from across the map, commanding the ai is a , trained soldiers cant keep their weapon still after sprinting 5 meters, c-3po has smoother movement than the player. i know this is a milsim but it doesnt play like a sim at all, controls are confusing and there is too many of them and theyre spreads across the keyboard making me feel like i have to use both my hands on the keyboard. it feels like im trying to fly a spaceship, not make a human do simple everyday movement. yes i know i can place my own keybinds but whats the point of making the controls stupid like this in the first place? flying planes and choppers seems to be harder than it was in arma 2, im not sure if anything is changed or if its just been a long time since ive played arma 2 so im not gonna criticize that. as far as tanks and other land vehicles go it has the same problem as controlling the soldier, stiff and confusing, and the instructions arent really helping. if you like the feeling of actually having control of the charcter youre playing. dont get this",16.8

"although the reliability of certain game mechanics and functionality is far from optimal, youre forced to cater to the games faults, making it that much more gratifying to master. modded servers are unreliable, at best, when servers are filled to the brim. accidentally falling from a 2 1/2 step will kill you. sometimes you get stuck in objects like walls and floors. sometimes, items disappear from your inventory and occasionally your inventory just isnt there, its gone. sometimes, sometimes a bunch of assclowns ddos the modded servers to frustrate the people playing. sometimes.....sometimes arma sucks hard, really hard. its bad enough to where, at times, it turns you off to gaming in general and makes you rethink your hobbies. sometimes it makes you regret building a computer just to handle its heavy processing load and having your heart torn out when it takes 48mins to join your favorite server, for it to never happen. but then, i remember, arma is intensely intricate. things can be done and scenarios can be played out, only on arma. this is a big boys game, taking patience and intelligence. you buy this, i guarantee that you will hate life 40% of the time you play it. you dont buy this, youll regret it for the rest of your life. 10/10 *ps: dat altis life doe",663.9
"great milsim, good ballistics, powerful editor, endless replayability, this game has it all. with the new dlcs coming out this game will only get better. the only thing i could complain about is the ai. they are a bit overpowered. however, the multiplayer makes up for it. i really recommend samatras king of the hill. even with all this, i suggest you pick this up while its on sale. if you ask me, its a little expensive for what it has to offer.",306.5

"dont buy this game expecting a quick fps twitch shooter, this is a tactical military simulation. yes, you do sometimes have to be quick with a rifle, but a lot of the game is getting the right rifle into the right place at the right time. plan your attack. prioritise your targets. place your team. only then, do you open fire. and remember, in every war, theres always luck and chance that plays a hand. its a great game, if you are prepared to to put the time in to play it properly.",653.7

"hour after hour the game can be enjoyable to an extent but with the serious lack of software support from bi-studios the game is lackluster in how it performs compared to its previous game. they still since the launch of alpha have yet to create a patch for a simplistic bug and are lazy programmers in the least. it seems that the modding community has to pick up the slack of their terrible coding to fix not only simple coding issues but also the major areas just to be able to have good mods...... pretty horrible if you ask me, i would have expected alot more coming from bi-studios.........",493.3
"arma 3 is an excellent game for 2 reasons. number one, its engaging and immersive and fun, and number two is the fact that bohemia interactive cares about its modding community (hence the competition make arma, not war). but arma 3 comes with a few flaws. chief among these, in my opinion, is optimization as i own a very good mid-level pc and i seem to be getting around 16 to 20fps. also is the lack of vehicles and weaponry, although i know that is set to change, i would have liked the game to be complete and not an about to finish up beta. but if you have some friends that are interested, then why dont you visit the islands of altis and stratis. live a new life in altis or stratis life, fight for survival in wasteland, or work together to defeat opfor ai in invade and annex. just bare in mind that this is a military simulator, so no run and gun or rendezooks here, just good ol fashioned tactical warfare.",436.7

"arma 3: arma the almighty miletary sim, which may catch your eye with the immersive feel and the futuristic feel which i will get to later. i feel that this is a good arma but not on the same par as arma 2 which can i tell you can be either a bag of piss or alot of fun to play with bugs and  ai to some of the most action packed immersive combat you will experience to date. arma 3 delivers what it sets out to do an invasion of a made up map and you need to help secure it (sorry if you would class that as a spoiler). there are few if any bugs and beautifull graphics great multiplayer improvement from arma 2 but as a fan of the series i am a bit dissapointed in bohemia with their choice of a futeristic feel which i dont personally like compared to modern combat. if you are a laid back gamer you will still enjoy this title due to the community, multiplayer, beauty, editor. the editor is my favourite part of the game as it lets you be creative and put what you would want in a campaign mission into your own. overall i would reccomend this game but if you are looking for an army sim go for arma 2 by far.",49.6

"i cant say much about the games single player experience, since i havent really done a whole lot with that. what i can say is that in large scale co-op missions, you really see this game at its full potential. this is easily one of the best co-op experiences ive ever had, and ive been gaming since i was 3 years old.",378.4

"boss game, campaigns are really good so far... would recommend... the editor is the best thing.",53.8
"this game is absolutely ridiculous in the fact that there is so much more to this game than shooting and killing. i was sick and tired of the neverending onslaught that is call of duty and battlefield. while i see both of those as fun in a fast paced competitive environment, i wanted to find a shooter that had more of a roleplay aspect to it. arma 3 is exactly what i was looking for. you cant just run out in the open and expect 360 across the map headshots while hipfiring with an smg (one the maps are huge and two bullet drop). cover can keep you alive while in a deadly firefight and can keep you alive while your buddy tries to save you with his gunship he stole from an enemy base. also, there is a free movement camera by holding the alt key which changes the fixed camera in typical first person shooters. you can be running into a forest while looking to your right and you might notice an enemy patrol and can drop to cover before they notice you. and then theres the mods. there are so many different mods to make the game sound and look better and modded game modes that add even further role play in the game. i spent about 80 hours in one week addicted to one of those game modes and ended up missing a few days of school because i was sucked in. this game is best when playing with friends!!!",191.1
"i love arma 3 . my love for this type of game goes back to operation flashpoint. but i hate this  of a game at the same time, it still doesnt work properly. bohemia acts like here game done with their final release of the  campaign, but it is a game you will play and only enjoy it and the experiences 20% of the time, it will frustrate you more times than please you. i love it, but what a !",472.0

"highly polished arma ii with future weapons, new shooting stances, and vast detailed maps. like its predecessor the mod community makes for a highly customizable game experience now backed by steam workshop. warning: some dedicated fan boys of the arma franchise would claim this is a very smooth game, i feel while smoother than arma ii its still a far cry from being entirely smoothed out. the most popular game mode seems to be wasteland which is dayz with out zombies. as you can imagine new players often get camped and ed prior to even finding a weapon. supposedely you can port arma ii objects into arma iii, i have not tested this yet, but that proves to be some what promising for custom map design.",16.5
"this game is awesome for its multiplayer and campaign and dont forget the editor part, oh gawd how many hours i have spent on editor so yeah i recommend this game if you like action and tactical combat. the dlcs on this game is great, my personal favorite dlc is the heli dlc cause i love to fly helicopters in that game, it has also a go-kart dlc and thats very fun with friends to race with. so yeah i rate 10/10",238.4
"good single player, great coop multiplayer...when it works. the servers are rather sketchy, they dont run very well and there are hackers waiting to ruin your experience. just this past week one of the servers was hacked 3 times! but, it is fun and when you get on a server that is good it is worth all the trouble. but, the most annoying thing to me is this has only been out for a year or so and the coop servers are already kinda dead and this is dissapointing. most people only play altis life, the role playing section of the game, which id rather just play gta online. if this is on sale, buy it. wouldnt shell out the full $60 on it though. if you love tactical games such as ghost recon and rainbow six, this is your game. all in all 8/10.",121.2
"best game ever it is really fun doing the altis life.",78.7
"this game is very entertaining altis life is just so much fun",383.6
"i do recomend this game but it has its flaws. its a tone of fun and multiplayer is fantastic if you are willing to play a long time. ussaly in multiplayer their are three types of game modes. rpg,player vs player or player vs ai. in all three it takes some time getting used too, their is a lot of walking and not always in your face combat like cod or bf4. its a simulator, a really really buggy simulator. and here is where the flaws come in. the game is so buggy and poorly optimized it takes more hardware then is nesseary to run it at good fps. people with some of the latest graphic cards and cpus still get low fps, and the ai is horrible, not as bad as arma 2 but its not great. with a $100 grahics card and $100 cpu you can play this game on low graphics after tweaking it a bit tho. but that being said the game is really fun still and defintaly worth your time if you are willing to put effort in learning how its played. also you do not need this game for anything that deals with dayz. dayz standalone does not need this game to run and for some reasion a lot of people thought this.",620.2
"i had a lot of fun with this game but these bugs and laggs and the fact that this game sometimes didnt work at all make it unplayable. so if you wanna get f*cked up by lagg etc this is the right game for you!",204.8
"after 500 hours of gameplay experience ive decided to write a proper review on this game. now lets get started. the multiplayer is way off for a game this huge the fact that your gonna be getting 60 fps barely is disappointing. it drops to 50 to 25 in a few mins. they overprice their dlcs and give little content. most people on this dont dislike other fps shooters because of exo suits or police brutality such as call of duty and battlefield hardline. they choose to like this game because of their own ignorance and their specs being so low this is the only crap they can run. the single player is a waste of time it is completely boring and long. the only now read this part steady only reason this game is getting a thumbs up is because of the mods. most of the mods are very very entertaining hell if they just got the mods and turned them into games there would be no point to this. if you choose to buy this go ahead if you dont, dont",588.9
"this game is so chic!!!!! i recomment it. the graphic is amazing.",33.6
"in a world of call of battleduties, arma 3 is a welcome breath of fresh air. as a former infantryman, no other game makes me feel quite at home like the arma series. ive been a fan since op flashpoint and arma 3 is an excellent continuation of an excellent series. my only issue comes with bohemias seeming lack of research into actual uniforms and equipment, but other than that, the arma series is fantastic. also, the modding community is fantastic. you do yourself a disservice in not getting this game.",284.3
"youre going to need a good pc to run this with a reasonable amount of frames, and youre going to need to abandon your call of duty mentality to truly enjoy this --and youre also going to want to get serious about the mod community- but if youre a fan of military style games and want a massive environment with no invisible walls, then this is the game for you.",287.8
"revised my review as my last one it was only in alpha, but things have only got better. the possibilitys with this game are almost endless, the multiplayer is by far the most, enjoyable i have played. with so many different game modes, and mods available, you can never get bored. play with your friends and the fun just multiplies. dont get me wrong it has its problems, bugs are still there, and altis can be annoying at times with its lack of cover, but it is a real island, and if they strayed away and changed it, then i wouldnt be altis. the best thing with this game tho is its realism, when one bullet can take you down, and end your day. it adds a fear factor into the game play, where you seek real cover, use real line of sights, and have to make corrections for the ballistics of the weapons. its not for everyone. but any hardcore sim gamer will love this, its still has the arma feel to it, which was something i first thought it would loose. play it. for me, its a 9/10.",819.9
"okay this game is amazing and pretty as crysis, if not, more pretty, the detail put into this game is beond imagination, its fantastic, and the game is really good, but it is a miltary sim, and not like battlefeild, its pretty much one bullet in the right spot and youre done, so you have to be patent, and to conlude this review im going to tell you the only ture con of this game, this game requires a gaming setup, it is very cpu heavy i suggest having an i7, and a good one at that, the gpu is pretty standerd requirments on this game but have a good cpu, and this game is very fun",65.2
"great simulator... i would recommend before playing this game to play other games to get familiar with combat controls.. great game!",76.8
"amazing military simulator, a bit lacking in content in comparison from arma2, but improves from the former in so many ways.",524.9
"good, realistic.... f**k it, its arma 3-the best game ever 11/10",119.3
"as is typical for russian developers there is little foresight applied to teaching game mechanics. the learning curve is steep and harsh. the ai ridiculously god like. if battling an uphill struggle wearing nothing but boxer briefs while burly vikings throw large barrles full of stones down at you sounds like a good time, then arma 3 is for you.",5.1
"great game, it has amazing greats, brilliant realism, awesome playability.... problem though.... the community. as with any online game there are always people there to cuss or spam music and with no rap or vote procedure to kick such people off you are forced to join another server. it seems there will never be a screening process to keep scumbag trolls away from team based online games such as arma 3. all in all... good buy and i recommend it to anyone wanting an indepth war simulation.",14.9
"really fun and intense so long as you have a good enough computer! very demanding graphics so research if your computer can handel it. :)",66.1
"absolutely great buy. i wasnt into arma 2 that much as i bought it just for dayz, but this game was something else. i got into arma 3 very easilly even with some of the complex controls. i love the campaign as it is even though it is still going. the player comunity is great to interact with and the game delivers. good buy.",22.3

"this game is trash. arma 2 with updated graphics and controls. you cant run for more than 10 seconds at a time because everyone is overweight apparantly. just ruins the game. cant go anywhere quickly unless its in a vehicle. awful... was going to buy if it was like 10 bucks at christmas sale but not anymore. this game blows just like arma 2. the only thing arma 2 had going for it is dayz mod. and even that got old.",7.4

"arma 3 is a eagerly welcomed upgrade from arma 2. the new stance system, upgraded engine, and water gameplay truly helps you experience the life of a military operator. the best part is that the modding community is stronger than it was for arma 2, with mods ranging to advanced ai to weapon resting, and custom gear to real world weapons, this game does everything better. arma is the only game youre going to find where its a good idea to find youre grandpas old army handbooks.",137.1

"fantastic game!!! it really does need some patches, more weapons and animation fixes (especially with reloading). but other than that, if you love extremely hardcore games (and only hardcore games, this game will be bad if your going to play it like cod or bf), then this is the game for you. considering the state that its in, id give it an 8.5/10 . but when the devs fix the glitches and animations, this game will easily score at least a 9.5/10 for a military simulation. it has a very steep learning curve, but in 5 hours or so you should get the hang of it :d",126.1

"from the guys that brought you that game with the takistanis comes a sequal in which comma usage is practically zero. the game now features less  factions such as csat and nba 2k12 oh and did i forget to mention now you can aim your rifle properly. all in if it i had to chose between rescuing an already redeemed arma cd key on a sheet of paper and my best friend from falling off a cliff in iowa.... dont know how the cliff got there, but i would chose the arma key because armsma is mein leibe armsma ist meine leute ich bin auto",437.9
"this is the most buggy game i have ever played in my life. i had all settings turned down to low so that i could work my way up to see what settings i could use comfortably but once i turned shadows on all the characters and guns went multicoloured and it put the fps down from 60fps to 1fps.",10.7

"im not going to say, buy this game!! because its not for everyone, if you like arma 2 or military, fps shooters (not cod, thats more like an arcade game) then yeah this game is awesome and is a leader in that market. if you think this game is full on, arcade style action packs bullets,bombs and metal flying all over the place, its not, but its just as fun as one of those games.",774.2

"seriously i had never played any game from bohemia interactive until arma 3. and only reason why i bought this game was that is developed by czech studio and i wanted to support them. so i tried it and guess what... i found the game very, very interesting. even when there wasnt any campaign, there was an editor (key feature of arma 3). in there you can create your own missions. and whats the best? you dont even have to be much skillfull. the editors interface is very friendly. only few minutes are enought to familiarize with whole process how to create a mission. if i take to account beautifull graphic and very deep done almost every detail in huge map (biggest you can ever seen in any game before), i can only say if the community stay so awesome how its now (modders, mission creators etc.) game have big potential be best fps military shooter in singleplayer and if you find good people for cooperation the second best in multiplayer.

"if you like arma ii youll like arma iii. if you havent tried arma ii you should definitely get that before you get this, to make sure you like the franchise as it is definitely a unique shooter. however, be warned as the game can be highly graphically demanding on the higher settings, and is comparable to arma ii on the lower settings (which is a little underwelming). all in all its a good game, and definitely one you should get in the beta due to its reduced price.",114.3
"i will never ever buy another mistake (bohemia interactive game). i trusted this company and purchased this game in alpha. not only did they deliver a buggy failure. they have the nerve of releasing expensive dlcs that are meant to be included in the game. and announcing new games when they havent even finished whats on their plate. this developer should be renamed as ea v2.1 never again bi, never again.",209.2

"arma 3 is an amazing military simulator that treads a line between ultra realism and arcade shooter. while the strange controls and not so eazy to adapt to type of tactics may seem intimitdating. dont let that put you off. this is an amazing game. with a very powerful editor and tons of multiplayer and singleplayer scenarios on the workshop and with the game you will have a lot of fun. there is no campaign and not too many vehicles compared to the last game currently. but the devs behind this awesome game have let us know these will come in due time.

"very unsatisfied with this purchase. im still playng arma 2 at this point very little time is wasted with arma 3. i am running a computer than can compleatly blast arma 2 i7 proccessor nividia graphics card (not the best but still expensive and good) and loads of memory and internet capability and this game runs total crap in multiplayer and 30fps on single with all graphics turned to bare minimum it looks only slightly better than arma 2 at this point. i could get past all that but the way you pick up ammo is just stupid really stupid. further more the ai is call of duty dumb and the part that ruins the game completly......you have to shhot enemys up to 5 times to drop them, now its based in the future so i figured maybe they are basing the logic on some form of new armor ok, so i aim for the arms and the thick part of the leg, a very easy kill or incapacitate shot for a 7.62, nope nothin just needs the same shots in. its like they forgot everything that arma was about. its like call of duty sandbox style",16.0
"its a great game, i mostly like the rpg mods but thats just me, what do you think?",76.5
"this game is a must for anyone who likes military-simulation.",736.5
"awesome game, fluid graphics, perfect for creating a battlefield set for a group. the only downsides are the small equipment, etc., but thats if you compare it to arma 2, which had 3 dlcs and an expansion; and also if you dont mind small bugs and glitches due to just classic arma physics :p. any vet of arma(people whove played previous releases in the series) will say that there are bugs, but the gameplay exceeds the bugs :) best part about it is that theres less 10 year olds than cod or bf >:d",415.9
"i reccomend getting arma 3 it is the best military/fps game i have ever played",19.2
"this an amazing military simulator with so many things to do! you can make your own battles on the editor, play the story line, or get mods and other missions that the arma iii community made! i wasnt sure about buying at first but now im glad i bought it!",19.2
"this game will keep you at 90% erection the entire time you play it.. with a few moments of throbbing ejactulation thrown in for kicks.",22.5
"amazing game love it, can be rage inducing at times, but in the end its all for good times, and good memories. 10/10",624.7

"so not a fan of the 2035 setting, but the changes they made to arma are great. this game is a pc crusher and requires only the best to play it though. military realism cant be found at this level anywhere else.",261.1
"this is the best mil sim on the market and one of the best fps games. great graphics.",268.4
"love this game. altis life is my favorite gamemode so far. i highly recommend this game.",511.6
"its a great game. with all of the different gamemodes you will not go bored.",617.9
"a well made military simulator with a great community. the game puts you right in the action during those tense moments when the bullets flying around you could kill you in one or two hits, making every battle decision worth thinking over. missions with a team could never be more realistic then when you are just a band of gamers who have never met before, hunched over your computers and just barely making a dent in the opfor forces. even when you are on the move to the action, the game still keeps your attention. the moments when you are completely oblivious, then suddenly ragdoll to the ground with the respawn screen popping up really teach you to be aware. overall, arma iii is an amazing game that made a lasting impression on me, considering im new to the series. originally buying it to play altis life, i soon found the rich treasure trove of content this game holds.",131.0
"one of the best pc games i have played only down sides are the optimisation is pretty bad but apart from that awesome game",375.0
"quite possibly the worst game i have ever played. vehicle control is stupid. helicopters are impossible to control. your tank crew is borderline . enemy hitbox is the size of a pixel, meanwhile yours can be hit while you are behind a house. biggest waste of money ever. this game is an aweful scam.",107.2
"banned for someone elses fault period life in altis gets givin million bux bi bans me  you bohema!  you!",143.4
"well it wont even play on my main freakin monitor... soo. no i dont recommend this game because the devs are to damn stupid to even make sure the game plays on the right monitor!",24.3
"never seen so many bugs in a final game (that is out for some month now). in general, it could be so much fun.. an open world, a sandbox with lots of vehicles and items. but everything is laggy and broken. i want my money back bohemia! -_-",11.0
"if you play alone, i would wait to a steam-sale came, but with friends its totaly worth buying now! cool stuff in arma is altis life and king of the hill. really good games in arma. you can download battle royale (mod) too. the campain is what it is. not really good, but good enough. would like if you could drive more armored vehicles, and the save system i dont like ether, i should be a autosave that dont delete its self when a new autosave come. like i got pretty far one time, and a auto save came and i died 2sec after the autosave came. so i died every time i respawned. so i had to start over again... campain: 6/10 cool, but need more vehicles (with gun on) multiplayer: 8/10 good enough to buy it graphics: 8/10 my pc can handle ultra graphics, and the nature looks amazing, but something here and there is missing",281.2
"one of the best shooters out there. on ultra graphics the game looks real. the combat is so open that it is diffrent every time. i put 12 hrs on this game the first day i got it. with so many game modes it never gets boring. 10/10",303.7
"full of bugs, unoptimized and to many buttons to learn in one lifetime. despite all this its still alot of fun to play with some friends an evening from time to time",11.8
"if you were looking for a tacticool military shooter that is going to take hours out of your life, look no further, for you have found your game. arma 3 includes: -sleek helicopters -guns of the future -x-ray visioned ai -sleek tanks -an oversized flat map -an undersized hilly map -good multiplayer -and more! squeakers may appear on weekends.",430.6

"well if you can play this then go for it but dis game not optimizsedsed and not run good, my 2 gtx 780s can run this fine but with occasi0n4l proble,ms game pley is gud but sumtimes lots of running and driving but overall 75/100",16.6
"if you expect to run this game at good framerates on nvidia cards, it is more than likely you will be tweaking the settings to almost nothing before getting at least 30fps in campaign matches!",0.5
"its just so great to play, havent been playing on my computer cause i cant play it on this one... but ive been playing it on my friends pc and it ran fine, just play and youll see that is fun. realistic is one of the things that is well made in this game to, man i liked it since i saw the first trailer",18.1
"this game will lagg if you dont have a good graphics card or have a good hard drive so watch out and have fun!!!",310.0
"completely unpolished game with an engine that runs poorly. expect crashes often and low fps on even the best rigs. down right terrible execution of a game/idea.",120.0
"best arma so far es[ecialy physics of the vehicles, as well as its amazing graphics!",190.1
"this game is  compared to arma2. gear loadout saving process is  and not working, optimization is , ai is . in other words, its a downgrade. keep playing arma2 until this game is patched/fixed",125.6
"a more realistic battlefield/cod when you play modes like wasteland or king of the hill; can also be fun if you play the dayz mod for free; battle royal, do i need to say more? get dropped on an island with 30 other people, find a weapon and survival of the fittest!; if youre the roleplaying person, who likes to deal drugs, have s (women, who sell their bodies to greasy guys) or just be a corrupt cop, then altis life is just the right thing for you! so in general, this game offers are great variety of mods, its very own realism and its not full of garbage kiddies, who flame and pretend to have made love with your mother (like the cod-fanboys, lel) 10/10 would buy again",335.3
"excellent game if you have a half decent pc. people whinge about not much content but i found there is plenty for everything that i need and i believe most people need. if more content is needed, there are plenty to choose from. some of the mods such as breaking point (a zombie game on altis) are far superior to the dayz sa and most dayz for arma mods without the building as yet. i am sure that sa will get better but with patches few and far between it will take some time. arma 3 multiplayer is also very enjoyable with some mates and a few beers. certainly worth it if your into a bit of realism compared to other aa or aaa titles. be patient with the game, the end result is awesome all around.",781.7
"this game is one of the best i have ever played.. if your into games about stealth, combat, shooting and driving tanks and helicopters, this is one for you! get it now while its cheap!",64.4
"if you like awesome army stuff then multiply by 100 = arma3",163.1
"this game is very buggy, i have an average graphics card that can run most of the games out there but with this game, you need like a $9000 computer to even run it. the maps are way too huge for your graphics to run smoothly, i had to turn everything down and even still i was lagging like crazy. i would highly recommend playing the battlefield series instead of this game because a. you will get more enjoyment and entertainment from battlefield b. your computer will be able to run it c. better vehicle system and lots of weapons to choose from",8.0
"bohemia really knows how to create a war simulation game, i have no idea how did they get a game to run smoothly on a bad computer. good job, best of 2013!",96.2
"ever wondered how it feels to be a muscular, hard- operator? well too bad, youre a scrawny ing toy soldier with futuristic gadgets which does all the fighting for you so all you get to do is walk around in your undies while in base. i want a refund, this isnt what i payed for, even for an alpha. however, bis sure nailed that underwear buldge just right. 9/10 average rail-shooter.",261.4

"its a good game, the test on the weekend was great",650.0
"other than the fact that is a lot more like a fps than simulator there is still fun to be had. thanks to a more intergrated modding system (steam workshop) it is easier to find and install various mods and missions. for people who liked arma more for the vehicles than this might let you down. there is only a couple jets and handfull of tanks. there are not many weapons even though you can interlock attachments. so in conclusion if you want more vehicles wait for mods and i recommend it. i feel that the graphics and map are well made and it is great idea to get. especially for wasteland. and maybe a day z......",67.5
"very good game and sequel to arma 2. multiplayer is quite fun but also quite difficult for some newbies out there to online shooters. but to the more experienced hand this game is a must have. 10/10",736.1

"i disobeyed my 12 year old commanders orders and mortared our supply station.",4.0
"very good, very hard, very.... laggy at times. arma 3 is great, its fun tactical and all that good stuff. the community made content is fantastic and the multiplayer is great if you find a decent enough server. however it does carry over quite a few problems from its previous installments, some of these incluce -extreme difficulty navigating buildings due to weird responsiveness of controls -nearly all of the building are unfournised -too much wasteland servers -a lot of mp servers are laggy as hell -vehicles made out of ing paper that aside, its still the best shooter i have played as of yet.",259.9
"this is a really fun game with infinite possibilities. but it is buggy as hell sometimes when i enter a vehicle i die instantly",106.2
"the staff of this game was pillaged to make dayz standalone, everything about it is just sad and it makes me nostalgic for vanilla arma 2. czech yourself into a mental hospitality if you buy this.",12.8
"good simulation game. but what the  with these dlc, 7 weapons 12?! 3 helicopters 12? have you been bought by ea bohemia?",146.7
"great game, great graphical infrastructure and great team play. this game has it all. with modding available in the workshop, you can create your own war. if your a fps fanattic, this is the war game for you! online is just as fun :)",150.9
"been playing the arma series for a long time now. i love being able to control every aspect of a simulation, and arma has always hit the nail on the head with that (albiet quite glitchy at times). if you can handle the poor ai voice-overs, and endless amounts of shenanigans, this game is for you. this is not a pick up and play shooter though, it is truly a military simulation, so bear that in mind. with all that being said, i have throughly enjoyed the hell out of arma 3 and its beutiful lighting and most of all the user created content. if it wasnt for the arma modding community, this would have got boring pretty fast.",352.5
"it sucks it has the worst campain, it crashes all the time, the phyics suck, it has the worst a.i., and also if your playing on sever that does saves your progress then when you crash which happens all the damn time you have to ing start over",302.6
"if you played the cod series and wanna jump into this i dont think its for you, however if you like war simulators, bullet drops, tactics and realism i do indeed recomend it. enjoy!",829.1
"pretty good game... would be a great game if it was better optimized. i would get it on sale but i wouldnt pay full price for it. edit: this game has so much potential but the developers failed to optimize the game at all. do not buy this game until they fix it, if they ever do... so disappointing and such a let down.",122.2
"can be much better........great ideas.............needs much improvement..............ah yea the ai........little joksters they are.......they just dont like dieing.............",403.8
"lots of fun game modes, altis life, wasteland, battle royale etc. hackers can be a bit of a bit of a problem crashing servers every so often and killing everyone. graphics are nice. movements and gunplay can occasionally be clunky. lots of different stances for any type of situation and lots of vehicles to have fun with. overall 8.5/10.",162.8
"fun game its best played with friends though however it does feel very realistic and it takes a bit to get used to if ur used to more close ranged fps",263.2
"absolute crap in recent updates have always been a loyal arma player but optimization in the last few updates have made the game unplayable on mid-high range systems you need a beast of a rig to run this game now i stronlgy reccommend for the averge player dont waste your money on this anymore",150.3
"i played the game for 3 days i loved it, it was by far the best game i have ever played",182.2
"1st time playing this i go on altis life with a friend, heres how it went: we spawned, bought a bag and a hat each, went picking apples for a few hours then bought a car each and went to do some delivery missions my friend crashed and i drove 18.5km to repair his car, only to find he was dead 2 paramedics came and revived him, i took the hat from my dead friends body first and offered it as payment the girl took the hat because the guy didnt like it and then accused me of being sexist because he wanted my hat he chased me around his ambulance for 10 minutes shouting give me the f***ing hat i dropped the hat, drove off only to see the ambulance over take me and get blown up by terrorists i then burned in the wreck trying to get my hat back 11/10",29.3
"you think this is a tactical 1st person/3rd person military simulator but actually its a running simulator, where you spend 90% of the time sprinting while looking for enemies, 5% of the time in a vehicle that you managed to find, 4% of the time shooting at black dots 300m away you assume are people, and 1% of the time actually killing a person im exaggerating of course, but still you spend a lot of time running in the middle of nowhere",28.9
"yeah i reccomend it as i crash all the time but im hoping to fix that soon and the times ive been able to play it was a fun time killing ai",60.1
"good game needs more interactive modes for most fun as there is a lot of traveling and not mutch shooting but is still great",183.9
"so there i was.... in the middle of a tdm server... i loaded up with my favorite sniper rifle and ghille suit which was not useful in any way, and spawned in the middle of the firefight. and then what happened? 360 no scope like a baws cod style!........ just kidding, i died instantly. if you want a first-person/3rd-person shooter game that isnt ridiculously  and made like a michael bay movie, then arma 3 is the game for you. im telling you, this game is one of the most realistic (if not the most) war games you will ever find out there. battle on atlis(arma 3 world) takes everything into account - how much gear youre carrying and how heavy it is (because with the new fatigue system, well trained soldiers have been transformed into chain-smokers), with sniping you have to take into account the wind speed, distance, and elevation; stealth tactics and just basic common sense. if youre the one who likes going in guns blazing with explosions everywhere expecting to get a triple kill, then youre in for a rude awakening when you try this game.",163.9
"great game, and so much stuff you can do with all the types of mods you can play a must get.",139.6

"yes i know the game is not yet fully released, and i am reviewing this in alpha, but when you have played this alpha you will understand why. the graphics are amazing, almost real life they are that good on high to max. the gameplay is more tactical and good fun, i did not enjoy any arma game but this is far better and probably the best one to date. cannot wait to see the final release, and iron out the bugs, if bohemia do that this time. the exploring is top fun, there is tons to find and do, the missions is alright, and it seems that the island is not actually that big.... but anyone, when on a mission with a friend you do not care. anyway overal the game is top fun and the graphics is what makes this game just pure wow. i hope dayz comes to this, because it would be more fun.",214.9
"i was perma banned even before playing a single match",1.3
"very good game, it can be quite boring if you dont have anyone to play it with. although i tell you, there is plenty of friendly and good players out there to join in with. no external friends required. i give this game 8.5/10, it loses 1.5 points because it can be rather buggy at times and quite badly optimized. it has great graphics, very good community, adrenaline pumping moments and it hits the line perfectly between realism and virtual, it is all you could ever want in a military simulation game.",560.7
"car physics, fatigue is pretty dumb. good looking , runs",190.6
"i loved arma 2 and i love arma 3, it is a very cpu intensive game but worth it. runs smooth and if it is on sale it is worth it",67.6

"i was killed and i spawned in the middle of nowhere began running to god knows where suddenly i heard the sounds of a plane looked up there it was it landed smoothly in front of me 2 men came out, i was cautious but i didnt shoot just yet would you like to join us on our space adventure? hell ing yes i will we got in about 13km in the air were struck by lightning pilot says dont worry, i can land us safely alright ok cool pilot turns off engine we crash into a mountain they both died but i survived looted their bodies note to self: never go on space adventures",40.8
"arma 3 is an improvement over the previous ones, but the game still suffers from clunky interface and lackluster ai. for an arma fan like myself, though, it is the best arma so far.",783.8
"why is this even in my library i dont own it. must be from free weekend that happened 20 years ago and steam needs to do more often. anyway, game was fun but it is definitely not worth $60, plus another $18 for dlc. no way. for $60 you could buy two other games, a four pack of condoms, a bag of doritos, a bucket to use while you play games, and still have a bit left over.",15.1
"great role playing game i have been addicted to this game ever since i got it :d kill everyone in kavala and rebel my people!",241.8
"yes. the best battlefield simulator of all time. altis is freaking huge, better have a powerful cpu for this one, gpu is barely used.",332.0
"dat graphic is sick as heck. worth all the money. the controlls is not that easy to learn but you get it later. recomended!!!",42.1

"if you havnt already played any arma titles youre missing out so why not start now?",270.8
"arma 3 is a very fun game to mess about on but it is quite hard to play seriosly as the ai are absolute  and becuase crashing into a fence at 2 kmh in a car kills you. apart from this it is a very fun game to play on altis life but i wouldnt really recommend it that much who actually want to do millitary stuff on it.",556.6
"outstanding game, with open environment and wide option of completing the mission.",7.4
"heading the same way as ea. dlc hungry company. its horrible thing to exclude things from a game to later include in a dlc, but then remove stuff from an already launched to put into a dlc....you guys have lost sight of putting out a game for people to just enjoy. money talks to you now.",360.7
"the best military sim game. the solo campaign is a bit different this time, with episodes. the first one is very good and shows us many new features. the editor, which can be complex or very intuitive, depending on what you want to do, promisses endless possibilites for the future. the ai was reworked, the gameplay is more or less the same as arma2, the graphic engine is wonderful if you have the machine to take it!",99.6
"this game is awesome when u play on atis life servers",13.9
"this game just makes me feel incredible, it feels like your in the game going with it. i love it its really nice textures nice detail and best thing of all its best game you cuold posibly buy in might cost alot but its worth it. its a simulation,military,multiplayer,action,tactical,realistic so many things you cuold think of. ill give it 10/10 the best shooting action simulation tactical game ive ever played thx developers! :d",17.2

"always low on ammo. navigation is horrible. land mines everywhere. blown up every 4-5 minutes. wish i hadnt wasted my money.",4.6
"ive just started playing arma 3, and ive just played out the whole bootcamp, so i now know the basics. i think that its a extremely fun game, even though i havent tried out the multiplayer yet, but from what ive seen from gameplays i think it will be great! for those who want totry some real combat secenarios outside the bootcamp (beggnienrs) i would really recommend scuba, which was a exremely fun gaming experience. note thogh that i havent played all the showcases yet.",10.6
"arma 3 is an amazing game! this game is great for anyone who likes shooters or rp games. this game is one of the best first person/3rd person games i have ever played. i have played arma 2 and i have to say arma 3 is so much better than arma 2. the only problems about this games that really game to my attention is... first off glitches, theyre not too bad but they can get annoying every now and then. also servers is a big problem, there arent many servers out there for a variety of gamemodes, the ones that i commonly see is deathmatch or battle royale, breakingpoint, king of the hill, and some others, but other than that this game is really fun and an enjoyable experience for players that are new or old to the 1st/3rd person shooter genre. i really recommend you get this game, especially if youre coming from arma 2 or even battlefield. thanks! i hope i helped you out!",110.1
"hello everyone thematrixman here giving my review on this fantastic game. so if you have played arma 2 this is a huge jump in the right direction. personally i didnt like arma 2 due to its crappy controls and bugs. however, i did like the big open atmosphere which arma 3 keeps and even out does it if i say do so myself. i gonna be straight out with you guys i have not beat the campaign yet because of difficulty and just lack of interest. the multiplayer is really the way to go as well as player made levels. i recomend playing capture the island for it puts this game to its max and create the intensity of a real war. overall if you are ever wanting to play cti msg me and we can frag some noobs. the commaning is really crisp and you often have to think on the fly which is great for people who like strategy like me. the a.i arent that bad as they can fly helicopters better than me, but driving is another story (psst, if you put them in relax mode they will only drive on roads). so i conclude that this game will provide you with endless entertainment and i hope to see some of you online. this is matrix signing out!",19.1

"where are the crosshairs on this game? if there are any i must be getting unlucky and picking all the servers without them. i mean yeah ok graphics, but bad animation details, doesnt really feel like a shooter when you cant aim down the barrel of your gun, or even see your gun sometimes. the controls for this game are ridiculous, theres no need for all those controls, games not hard they just spent alot of their time putting useless stuff in it.",2.8
"as the 3rd installment to the arma series the quality that this game brings to the table is unpresidented in any other arma game. with the rv4 it adds in directx 11 to bring stunning new visuals never seen before in the franchise. the clunky mechanics from arma 2 have been reworked and are now fluid as ever in arma 3. although the game was rough at launch with performance the series of patches have vastly improved performance and by far is the smoothest arma to date! multiplayer is better than ever with the new vehicles new guns! overall id recommend this product to anyone who likes realistic shooters!",312.2

"an excellent military simulator, has a large learning curve and requires patience inorder to to become skilled at. like most multiplayer games, arma 3 works alot better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination, which is a very important factor in arma 3. its fairly system intensive , but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches, but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. i would highly reccomend it, especially if you have friends to play it with.",13.5

"definetly a step-up towards more realistic gameplay than cod and battlefield series. steep learning curve with all sorts of options in how to affect your avatar in the environment - too many for most of us - so it really takes time to get into. huge sandbox environments so plan on spending several hours in a match rather than your typical 20 minute arcade-shooter match. some of the options and controls do feel a little clunky at the moment. you do need a pretty decent rig to run on full graphic settings to get the most out of it. challenging - very challenging. great realism - it can be fustrating for new players so expect it going in.",8.1

"typical arma game - great potential and terrible execution. the ai is either comically bad, or super god-like with laser bullets. squadmates dont do what you order them to, they have a mind of their own, and its quite pathetic. random acts in the campaign make me shake with rage - i decided that i was not having fun playing this game and uninstalled. its unfortunate, because there is so much potential there, but its held back by terrible ai, questionable physics and horrendous mission designs in the single player campaigns.",27.6

"this game is one of the best that i have played, it has unlimited playability, great gameplay, and amazing graphics. what makes this game have unlimted playability is ita ingame editor where you can design your own missions and then upload them to the workshop if you choose or just keep it for yourself. this game is also the most realistic war simulator on the market because of its large maps, weapon physics, amazing ai, and its wide range of weaponry and tactics. this game is by far the best shooter you can get right now and i highly recommend it.",387.0

"this is my first review. arma 3 is one of the most realistic military sim youll play in awhile. the realism beats battlefield, but is slower. at first if youre not use to it you will wonder how you died. after awhile you will realize that you were shot around 500 meters away. arma 3 is for the players who want more realism than battlefield.the game has many positives and some negatives that i can note. positives: + amazing graphics in some places + big maps (2 really big islands, with one about 270km squared) +a decent amount of vehicles / weapons +alot of uniforms for player customization (using the virtual ammo box, that is present in some servers) + a very good editor and a real time edior named zeus + life like situations with other players + no annoying kids like call of duty negatives: - the campaign does not have a story that leaves an impression - the ai downright has no iq - needs a good computer - the map though big in some places are really just open land - hard to learn the game has its shares of positives and negatives, but will not be like any other game youve ever played. dont buy this game if you wont take the time to learn how to play. that is because it will overwhelm you if you perfer games like call of duty.",48.5

"if you come into arma with a battlefield or call of duty-mindset, you will die, you will find it to be something you wont like, and youll find yourself frustrated to pieces and back. this is not an fps, this is a military simulation. you have been warned. you will need to spend a lot of time in the game, getting a grasp of tactics and how to best employ yourself, your weapons, your squad and your support-options, before its truly enjoyable. this is also one of those games that are far better in multiplayer than in singleplayer. id actually go so far as to say that playing arma 3 for its singleplayer wont even begin to give you an idea of what arma really is, and that you should try out the mp once youve gotten a general grasp of things. the arma-series are not games you hop into casually. they are also games that needs to be extensively modded in order to become truly great, but luckily theres a thriving mod-community thats very active. on the downside: arma 3 is brutal when it comes to its demands of your hardware. you will need to tweak and fine-tune your ingame graphics-options in order to get the best playability out of the game. putting everything on max will put most if not all but the absolute highest-end computers into a high-stress environment.",72.7

"ive had arma 3 for a while now, and id have to say it is my favorite military game of all time. of course it has its glitches and lack of vehicles and weapons, but those can all be fixed by the community. there are so many memorable situations that you can get yourself into. for example, i was recently playing some arma 3 wasteland and about a minute after i spawned in, i ran into 3 enemies. at first i thought there was only one so i took him out with a few rounds from an assault rifle i had just found in a nearby building. i heard him yelling over the mic during the last few seconds of his life theres a guy here trying to kill me, you guys need to get over here! so after i stole his hard-earned money from his corpse, i layed in some nearby bushes waiting to pounce on his incoming friends. when they arrived i managed to take out one before my rifle ran dry and i was left to the mercy of the remaining twos machine guns. moments like these are what make playing arma 3 a truly unique experience. i highly recommend the game.",497.5

"arma 3 is a miltary simulator through and through, but unlike most simulators arma 3 has a campaign with in-depth story to boot and competitive mp thats more then decent. the ai is of a standard above what most games have to offer out there and each weapon, ground or aireal vehicle strive to give as realistic experience as can do when operating said equipment. weapons need to be zeroised and as per actual warfair artillery or mortars need to be given a grid reference (gr) before effective fire can be achieved; and you yourself can operate fire support weapons. the campaign is set into episodes and each episode has just below ten missions that offer a challenge in every aspect. although your ai teammates need to be babysitted somewhat and the game could use some more optimisation but thats a small price to pay in a game that is overall great. i score this game a 8.5/10.",38.0

"while i do recommend this game, its only thanks to armas modding community. and well in advance. because, while there already are some very good mods and missions for arma 3, the vast majority of them simply is additional content ported over from arma 2. as for the game itself in its vanilla form: thumbs down. bad net code, bad design, awful single-player campaign, terrible bugs (like ai twitching when you hit them with your fire). technologically arma 3 is stuck in 2009. graphics dont age well, it already looks outdated, while being very demanding resource wise - bad optimization. unfortunately, arma 3 doesnt have any competition in simulating combined arms warfare. while every aspect of arma 3 is done poorly, its the only game that comes with all of it in one package.",620.5

"cant tell you if you should buy it or not, but i can tell you this. you will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have. but when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, its something magical you just cant find in any other game. arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. you buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. arma is a game which you can never called finished. there will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! ill give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back. read: i will not accept random friend requests! if you have a question, please post it in the comments.",919.3

"not you daily average fast paced combat. most people says it is a military simulation and somehow i agree. smart devs, if you are bored you can try the virtual arsenal or the military fashion or maybe create missions in the editor where you just actually spawn random things. and its modable, too bad theres little in the workshop than armaholic. personally i like it, doesnt require high specs and its really breathtaking. campaign, multiplayer, showcases, custom made campaigns and many more. you dont have to be arma 2 veteran to play it. because this game is for everyone for those who wants to migrate from fast paced combat to military simulation.",301.9

"personally i would put this game as m game of the year if not my game of the decade, the fact is even with its flaws, bugs and the perhaps not as optimised as it could be engine...i would still recommend this to anyone who has gotten tired of the average shooter, because this isnt one. arma has alwasy been a miliary simulator and hopefully always will be and this makes the game into something that no other first person game can top. the realism is brilliant and the combat stance mechanic is something fresh offering different ways to take cover, adding new ways to be tactical. not a fan of realism and seriousness? check the workshop and armaholic. you are bound to find something that will have you laughing, crying and having a blast. after all whats not to like about racing go-karts with heavy machine guns mounted ontop? if there was one thing that does bug me its the fact that rocks...tend to eat you sometimes if you get too close so be careful with that tl;dr version: buy the game or i will make a rock swallow you 10/10",392.1

"first impression - nice graphs, what i mean it is epic nice, on the other hand, hard to get familiar with inventory, selection stuff, but all in all it is worth price. ....so only few words about this awsome goodness. way better than arma2, if you think your computer cant handle this game. trust me it can, even if arma2 were lagging for you. :)",345.4
"arma 3 is a fun game to play with friends if you dont have anyone to play with its not gunna be that fun but its a great game but only one thing i dont get why did they have to make the controlles so weird i mean why but besides that its a great game",16.9
"unbelievable game. the sheer amount of mods (some of them are even downloaded automatically, you dont need to do anything, except for joining a server) is just mind blowing. its a definite must-have for all fps fans. next to the obvious advantages like day-z, there are also really really great mods like wasteland. in wasteland (i only play that mod, it fulfills all my fps/action/adrenaline/survival needs) you play on either one of two teams, which fight each other, or you can choose to play a lone wolve who plays against everybody.... on the huge map of altis (really existing greek island) which is about 270km (yea really, you literally drive for hours and hours to get from one end to the other) you are left on your own, with only a pistol. you need food, water and equipment to stay alive. you may find them or you may have to keep looking. its the ultimate adventure for everyone who doesnt like the zombie-aspect of day-z (seriously, its fun until you killed 10 of these, then it gets boring). if you dont like some aspects of day-z or wasteland (or any other mod for that matter) than you just grap the code (mostly available on git repositories) and change what you need :) before i knew the potential of arma i bought bf4 and i really regret it. arma 3 is warmly recommended.",120.1
"the game is fun if you know what you are doing, if you know how to press 5 keys in about 1 seconds time then you will have no problem with the controls. there is a large learning curve when it comes to people coming from games like tf2 or counter-strike. you have to be tactical, and that is what defines the series as a whole. but for $60 i would recomend waiting for a sail even though there is plenty of content to have grounds for a purchase.",2.3
"fantastic graphics great simulation bad physics (better than arma ii though) good multiplayer some fun dlc and easy to give many hours of your life to this game in one go. campaigns are okay multiplayer is great... weapons are well modeled and the tactical simulation of this game is great especially online unless you get that one 12-15 yr old that wont leave the god damn black hawk alone and kills everyone constantly and ignores all administrators while wasting game slots... great game recommended.",169.8
"both a purchase and in many ways an investment. in spite of all of its issues (which are bound to come with a game of such a mind bogglingly immense scale, let alone one developed by an independent company) it is by far my favourite game of the moment and it looks certain to hold onto that position for a while, just like arma 2. i guarantee you will not find gameplay as unique and varied as what you will find in here, nor will you find a community so teeming with creativity and cooperation. if the missions you find on the marketplace arent enough, a quick trip to armaholic and you can already pick up early mods that add weapons, units, vehicles, islands and even whole factions. that is once you get the excellent (and i really do mean it, its great) and expertly crafted campaign episodes out of the way. bohemia are releasing the final campaign episode in march, alongside a massive new unannounced multiplayer feature and the promise of continued support throughout the games lifetime (expect an expansion on the scale of operation arrowhead). the community also has the ace mod which will undoubtedly turn arma into an even more brutally realistic game and 2017 looks like it could be the next day z, as if we werent already still getting our heads around that. just buy the game, srsly",626.9

"arma 3 is a great game if you loved previous chapters and you enjoy combined arms wanna-be simulators. its completely customizable and has an experienced community developing tons of additional content. unfotunately the game suffers from an old engine concept limitations wich makes everything feel clunky and buggy. the single player campaign is one of the worst ever created and doesnt reflect at all what a military operation is but its there so if you want to give it a shot.. plus the plot has almost no effort put in it. arma series fortunately relies for the 1% on single player campaign and 99% on community made content and coop multiplayer wich is the real core of the game. a must have if you want to join a clan that plays this game as a serious simulation.",171.5

"i have to say that this game is a worthy successor of the arma series. it takes aspects of the other games and improves them, while adding new content and a storyline that hasnt had a single broken level, or ai with a choppy voice. however, this game just isnt finished yet. id wait until the horrible fps drops on multiplayer are fixed. once that is done, the game will be perfect. wait a while before you purchase this game.",253.6

"now when the game finally has gotten some improvements to the framerate... its still just playable. anyone that thinks his got a bad computer should not buy this game. it will need the best pc components out there to even get near 60fps. poorly optimised game, but once you found the settings that works with your computer it can be a fun game. but still the slow movement, stopping while changing weapon is a deal breaker. im dissapointed that they didnt learn anything from arma 2. what i think about the game 1 is worst 5 is best graphics = 5 gameplay = 3 sound = 2 optimised = -3 playable? sure when you got the best pc there is to buy and nothing better to do.",44.6
"a good follow up to arma 2. with updated graphics and smoother movements, certainly one of my favourite milltary shooterrs out there. however, i am missing the familiarity of guns that arma 2 had with its massive assortments of weapons and vehicles. would definitely like to see more added on to the game on that respect. ai are more intelligent. maybe too intelligent. however, with great game types like wasteland and an integrated steam workshop, it certainly delivers. mods may also add on to the game the same way dayz and ace did for arma 2.",615.2

"arma 3 is a really niche experience. it is refreshing to play an arma game when the market is so saturated with mw type military shooters. to truly appreciate the realism and immersion of arma 3 you have to find a good server to play on. i have not played a game in recent memory that provides the realism that this one does and the community is really the driving force behind that. the gameplay is solid, but the learning curve is somewhat larger than your average shooter. combat is not in your face, but tends to be long range engagements that last a significant amount of time. the single player options are decent, and provide a good means for learning the game, but you should not buy this game if you are looking for a single player experience. my only other significant complaint is how poorly optimized this game is. it is a pretty game, very pretty actually, but it runs so poorly on even decent rigs that it can become quite frustrating. 7.5/10",59.6
"if youre sick of battlefield 4 and are still waiting for the good maps to be released: buy this. this game is incomplete, buggy and frustrating at times. you will feel right at home from battlefield, attempting to figure out how to ask for help or where the enemies are shooting you from. as for hackers: this game has partial hacker support (aimbots are incompatable). the fun is not killing, its attempting to organise, get from the base to the ao without dying or crashing you vehicles and smashing helicopters into the object you were attempting to pick up.",221.7

"7/10 - an evolution from previous installments. nice graphics and solid simulation. great squad placed multiplayer over a massive 400km sandbox. lack of content hurts its score although more is being released and developed. more campaign missions coming this december. pros: nice graphics, solid shooter simulation mechanics. more accessable compared to other titles but looses none of its depth. great combined arms mp. cons: lack of content, only a partial campaign. no training missions and still plenty of bugs remains.",25.4
"excellent. king of the hil with 3 teams fighting for one obj. coop for when you dont want to kill eachother and want to stalk the enemy down with a rifle, rocket, grenade launcher, tank, heli, apache, f18, or a45 frogfoot. vehicles control like a simulator. hours of entertainment. working as a team and assualting entire cities is an unforgettable experience.",54.3
"i can highly reccomend this game if you are into any sort of simulators, or realistic combat. i have had extreme amounts of fun with all of the user created missions, with or without friends. i reccomend once you have purchased this game to follow these steps to have an early look at the zeus free dlc as it can add a whole extra level of enjoyment with the mission ever changing due to your actions, in the state of mind of the dungeons and dragons role playing board game. this is ow you can have early access to the dlc: >purchase and download arma 3 >right click arma 3 in your steam library >click properties >up the top, you will see a betas tab, click it >the click the dropdown arrow next to opt out of all betas and change it so you are opted into the betas >click ok and return to your library, you should see an update for arma 3, around 1gb >if not, launch hte game, the update should now start >once the update has finished, launch arma 3 >from the main menu play multiplayer >from the server browser, find any server that is marked with a [dev] tag, this will be running the zeus dlc >play around on a couple servers, find which one takes your fancy >enjoy! that should be all i need to say, oh, have i told you to buy this game yet? jus jus just.... do it. take a leap of faith.",434.1

"worst game ive played in a long time, way too complex for a game.",107.8
"this has got to be the most challenging, strategic, and fun game on the market. if you like using your brain to get yourself out of seemingly impossible situations then this game is for you. the first campaign mission was not as fun but as the story develops the missions get better and better. the game is also absolutely stunning and looks like a movie at all times.",29.6

( altis life rpg ) if you want to be serious then you can have even more fun :) altis life rpg to be honest it took me a little while to adjust from playing arma 2 to arma 3 but once you have found your footing youll be a right happy chappy :) at this time the game is on a free weekend so i recommend that you try it .",104.4

"this game gets better and better every update. between the countless game modes and the workshop missions you can play this game is countless fun. i would suggest to wait until they do a 50% off weekend to buy it since they do those 50% off sales often. not saying its not worth the 60 bucks to buy it but just to save you some money. 10/10",515.4

"pros: this game is just beautiful. very photorealistic! when i first looked around in the game it was like whoa!. i can max it on my gtx 980 in 2k at around 40-50 fps, multiplayer allows a large amount of people to play on massive maps. the controls are great, you can have total control over you player. weapon accuracy is realistic, you cant hit anything without being tactical. it has a great training section that i advise you play before jumping into a server. cons: the muliplayer... i just dont understand. i admit i havent done any research on how to play, i didnt know i had to. i have not met a friendly entity in any game yet. as of now every encounter with another play has resulted in them shooting me, tazering me or hancuffing me to sell to another more advanced player... there is nothing you can do about it, both the faction and the police have simmilar procedures. there are, it seems, 1k commands. it will take a while of remapping for comfort and accessability, let alone learning the bulk of them. conclusion: it looks great and is the most immersive fps i have ever played. so get it! very taxing game on the graphics card. screen shots look amazing, but the 45fps is not enough to be competative, so i will have to turn down settings =( or buy another 980 =)",5.1

"this game is a branch in a dynasty of games, that have been plagued by bugs, glitches and errors alike. some are really funny, some are plain frustrating. all together, the game can let itself be hated, yet, the player will likely clock many, many hours none the less. why? because in what other game, you get to play in a variety of gigantic maps, to play epic missions, made by good mates? in what game, will you play in tense, long-duration military environments with complete strangers? this game will let you experience open-world combat simulation at its finest. along with bugs. and glitches. and desyncs. but considering the overall awesomeness of the game, those eventually become quite funny, or at least acceptable. reccomended for: the patient, mature teamplayer the military addict not reccomended for: the immediate-satisfaction gamer",955.8
"an interesting fps that is highly realistic, but still maintains a very fun feel. note: it is a fairly intesive game hardware wise, so i belive it will require a decent computer.",165.4

"do you have a monster computer? then i would suggest checking this out because it is an amazing game. dont have one? then this is the laggiest pos you will ever play. they didnt really bother on the whole optimization thing, i guess its too mainstream to optimize your game. im running a phenom quad core @ 2.8ghz, 8gb ram, and a radeon 7770 and i have to put this game on dead low settings just to make it even possible to play. that is just ing ridiculous, when these specs allow me to play any other game at high settings. i loved arma 2 and arma 3 improves on the series so much but the amount of power it takes to get into a decent size game just is not worth its price tag.",177.0

"by far the most realistic military-simulation game i have ever seen. my only complaint is that the controls are a little too complicated and setting up a gamepad is difficult. otherwise, this game is amazing. this game emphasizes team-work (flying solo pretty much doesnt work), but none of my friends play this game t_t ...so you should buy this so we can kill stuff :d",38.8
"a great game with many different ways to play! a wide variety of community and official game modes and mods exist for arma 3 that will keep you coming back for more. the campaign/single player really isnt anything special, but the graphics are on point. play with friends to get the most enjoyment! all in all, 8/10 would recommend!",355.9
"if your an arma fan this game wont dissapoint. its not fps in the sense that you dont have a health bar ect, one shot can kill you if placed right. this makes for using tactics all the more important. you dont just charge into a fight guns blazing, instead you tend to plan your approach and put alot more effort into each scenario. this is a true combat simulator and the best ive played of the arma series so far.",23.6

"incredible game made by currently unpresidented developers, supporting probably the best online community ever. there isnt enough superlatives to describe the astoshining feat made by releasing this sandbox, at least not without sounding like a rant. frankly, take any favorite fps or military game. then add sandbox, quality, free dlcs and continuos improvements, scripting possibilties, all vehicles and weapons and maps readily avaiable from the first try, no need to rank up and no need to pay to win. i could go on much further, but the best source for factual information is of course [dslyecxi] his youtube channel:",79.2

"absolutely worth buying. i wouldnt trust the relatively low metascore since this game lives from the content the community provides. at the point the reviews were done, there only were very few user created missions and mods. this game is very complex and deep. you will either hate it or love it, but you should definitely give it a try for at least a few hours before you judge.",395.4
"there is nothing, i mean nothing like arma. this is really and endless game. the mod community is robust and very active. everything, and anything is possible in arma iii. this is what pc gaming is all about! watch this video for a better example.",33.5
"ok, this game is a huge upgrade from arma 2, graphics were inhanced, gameplay was made better, when talking to teammates the guy doesnt sound like a robot anymore(especially when accouncing grid locations) and overall its just waaaaaaaay better . but, theres one thing that bothers me, the explosions. in arma 2 the explosions were majestic, they had vibrant colours and the colours were sharp. i used to place a tank and then make a jet destroy the tank just so i could see the explosion, or i would fly in a helicopter and shoot rockets, but in arma 3 the explosions look so unpowerful and the colour is dull, theres nothing going on, it doesnt feel or look like a real explosion(apart from the debris flying). arma 2s explosions looked alot better. that for me is the only down-side, the ai was also improved alot.",88.3
"optimization is horrible. i have an octa core and the cpu usage never dips over 30%. this causes my graphics card usage to never go over 30% as well. good game, poor optimization. the advantages outweigh the cons however as the devs continue to update and patch the game making it better and better. edited from a negative to positive.",36.3
"this game is a military simulator. its very fun to play and instead of running into rooms guns blazing like most shooters there is a lot more stratergy in this. it has quite a few mods that you can download from playwithsix and the workshop now. im in a group called special team delta and we do operations every weekend and they are pretty fun. even without my group i can have fun on public servers playing wasteland or koth. the story is very good and is a good length. there are optimisation problems with the game. i cant really get over 50 fps on high with my $900 computer but even on 15fps it is still playable.",547.3

"only played about an hour so far however, i have enjoyed that small time very much! way more realistic than arma ii, which i enjoyed as well. attachments, costume customization, ragdoll, graphics, swimming, extra animations and improved sniping adds for a great game... well done although, i cannot rate this yet. if youre looking for a war simulator, this is for you. the graphical optimisation still makes me want to vomit and i have not currently found the character customizer yet. snipe on!",105.5
"this game is amazing! if youve played arma 2 then you know what arma is all about. if you havent then let me enlighten you. the arma series is a 3rd and 1st person combat simulator with unlimited game modes such as breakingpoint, dayz, altis life, and normal seize and secure objective missions. jump in with millions of players and experience realism like never before. and for all the fans of call of duty and the battlefield franchise your in luck because this game has campain for you to enjoy with no 360 no scope . strategize, compromise, and defeat your enemies one by one in this tactically realistic military simulator. worth every penny!",27.5

"ok, yes i would recommend this game but in the vanilla campaign you seem to be a revolutionary insurgent instead of a nato infantry soldier. sort of special forces .. ish but without the nato aspect. create your own missions or join an online group and its a lot more realistic. its a shame that if you want to download player-made missions or join a clan you will have to heavily mod your game which can be a headf**k. so forget all those childish cod games etc. and get this game. the best milsim out there at the moment.",198.7

"ive pondered the question many times what is arma? it is an military simulator but it isent? the conlusion ive come to is its minecraft for grown ups you can do anything as long as you have the skills and imagnation that the game requires and yes sometimes since its an upen world game it can get a bit willy wonka here and there but thats with every upen world game",979.4

"the enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish bohemia interactives flagship franchise. its what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an fps. its what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. its what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke as valuable as being a crack shot. the scale of arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including arma 2. altis, a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. its a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but whats more significant is that armas landscape finally has the technology it deserves. 9.5/10",424.9

"although it may still only be in a disguised beta sort of stage,its still immensly fun when you hop onto a multiplayer server (try invade and annex which is what im referencing here) hop into a formed up squad and clear aos with the help of coordinated allies. zeus is also incredibly fun if youre into dropping people into s**t storms. the ability to basically create your own batles is a very fun concept indeed. workshop intergration allows mission creators publish their stuff easier and more people have more acess to it. if you want to buy it or not, i dont mind but you definetly keep your eyes on arma if incase something makes you just suddenly get the urge to buy it (like many, many mods) and i hope to see you on the field.",644.5

"hello everyone, i just want to say one thing buuy this game just no questions why just buy the game, i might have 90 hours on it but trust me you will have alot more then me once you buy it, and its way more fun with friends. so heres why you should buy it if you dont belive me then let me tell you why. pros: 1. alot of people play the game so it wont be hard to find a server you like or someone to play with 2. so many things to do like atlis life ( which is like living in arma iii ) and wastland and much much more 3. so many guns and vehicles cons: 1. you might need a good desktop ( not a laptop unless it amazing ), also no matter what specs you have the game might not run full ultra 2. you need a good intel card so like a i5 but i recommend a i7 4790k anything below this you might have some problems cause arma runs fully on cpu and a little bit of gpu so i recommend a good gpu so you dont bottleneck you pc but overall this is a great game and enjoy :d",157.8
"great game to start with it has a pretty good community which i value deerly. the game is pretty realistic, this can be a pain if you get shot and you dont even have a clue were it came from. although its a very good games its a bit of a bummer that the campaign is released in parts, but atleast the developers care enought to not rush the release, this would be worse. overall a good game although its pretty heavy for most systems.",269.6

"arma 3 is a great military simulator, you wont get the fast paced shooter feel that you get with bf4 or cod but instead get a slower paced but more rewarding (imo) experience. the non-combat roles such as logistics and support add an entirely different angle to what you get in other shooters. however it is a game you need to either play with a large group of like minded people or find something on the workshop that you like. i found the campaign had a decent storyline but wasnt particularily fun to play. however, some of the games ive had online have been simply amazing and to me thats what you should buy the game for. pros- highly realistic amazing visuals friendly community excellent mods available cons- not a great singleplayer game some missions take a while to get to any reasonable gameplay 7/10",380.1
"ill be quick and clear. im amazed how bohemia interactive has worked on this game, and the best is the support it has, performing the game every day. one of the best things about arma is the modding, and people developing it for our delight. i fully recommend this game.",155.4
"what? why are you reading the reviews? why havent you already purchased this yet? arma 3 is the epitome of virtual tactical military-based operations and simulation. in my eyes, this game is not just a simulation of military firefighting and combat; i find this game is a great practice for team-based cooperation and initiative. you need to work together to complete your goal, follow your team leader to succeed. there are many game modes that simplify the standard operations so new players will be able to experience the game in a friendly and forgiving environment that allows you to improve your abilities. arma 3 is a grand game and i definitely recommend it.",229.1

"not worth the price. arma 3 is a quite enjoyable game but far from worth 40 bucks. why? 1. singleplayer campaign is lame and unexplained. though i have to give the community a thumbs up for making some great scenario missions (custom missions). 2.the game is poorly optimized. when driving, flying or anything where your character moves fast, framerate drops to extremely low. i mean like from 90-100 fps to 20-30 fps. thats bad. 3. the graphics on terrain, vehicles and houses are just beautiful. though the playermodels look like theyre from a ps2 game.",10.4

"great game without mods. even better with mods! my favorite mods are tfar and acre!",934.3
"worst arma game in history. it feels more like cod or battlefield due to when you run you can see your wepon on the screen. the graphics are amazing but the graphics dont make the game. the realism is there due to the new stamina system and in vehicles you need more than one person to make it effective but they really didnt do what they promised like putting the take on helicopters flight model in so the helis feel like vtol planes when you fly really fast. i also dont like how it is set in the future because it cant be a simulation if it is in a era we have no clue about. and the weapons sound like your firing marsh mellows at people the 50. cal machine gun on the pickup trucks sound so quite when i fire a mounted gun i want to have the feeling that im shooting a 27mm gun with my hands not that im just firing another lmg. finally the nato forces dont have any jets in the vanilla game but the opfor and indpendents do it should be the other way around and also the lack of planes, helis and ifvs is terrible there should be more ifvs than tanks and thats not the case, if i want to take a patrol out im not going to take 2 mbts and a ifv im more likely to take a mbt and 2 ifvs im patroling not trying to take an airbase. those are the reasons you should not waste 60 dollers on arma 3.",112.8

"the game arma 3 is a superb sandbox military simulator. it has a campaign that showcases the game its self then it has individual showcases for elements inside the sandbox. it has an included editor for creating mission and mp missions. mods are very welcome element to this community. i have played altis life on the asylum server. this modification is a gta type atmosphere with lots to do. it has cops, civ, medic roles. housiong perm gangs and the like. i suppose i should mention some of the bad. the game can give frustration from time to time with hacking and game crashes. as unfortunate as it is it does exist. i had to spend a couple of days figuring out stop working errors. the game does get regular updates which help as well. also if you have a subpar rig this game can put some stress on your hardware. i get anywhere beteen 34-63 fps but some will have talked of worse fps thatn this. overall i reccomend this game just based on what is trying to be done here. this is a huge undertaking and very few games have the scope of this game with the and open sandbox experince.",339.0

"boring simulator 2014. love feeling bored? is your life not complete without pointless derision? then arma 3 is the game for you! you can take long walks with friends and talk about everything from the weather, the first time you got laid, or how you miss moms home cooking. if you join a full server, and stay in it for 3 hours at a time...you do run the risk of eventually encountering enemy combatants. this occurence is rare but known to happen. not to worry. you will die instantly and get to start the process all over again. so make sure that you read up on politics, sports, and current events so that you dont bore your online friends while on your long walks together. and for those having trouble figuring out the controls...lshift + tab + r + t will tie your right bootlace, should it happen to come untied during one of your walks. substitute r for l if its the left boot that comes untied first. on a side note, this game has a great online community. if you are new and need help...just ask. you will promptly be addressed and told to go **** yourself.",213.4

"the arma sierecs for me was a hard franshies to get into, but if you know what you are doing and can undersatand the advance controls, you can have a bunch of fun. for example my freind and i realy enjoy playing wastland (what dayz was based off of) doing missions and getting geo cheashes. so over all if you have friends that like to play with game or like to have a massive world to mess around in, get it, and if you have tried dayz or want to, play wastland it is a verry good gamemode with more wepons and vehicles. p.s. if you do play wastland find food and water, it is in buildings ;)",358.7
"unable to play with my friends in co-op. we could play on public servers together though (by joining them manually) but we couldnt play on servers created by one of us. we tried several tricks with firewalls and opening ports, connecting directly to server ip - doesnt work. maybe we actually could fix this on our own but were not with freaking nasa. bohemia probably thinks theyre very special cause i cant imagine why in 2014 i should freak myself out to find a way to play with my friends. i mean, its not even dark souls. game is great by the way, but its a special one. its not bf for sure .",172.2
"a nice simulator. unlike other games that try to give a warfare experience but instead give you a stupid cqc stage, in this game, it is do or die, you must team up, but you can give it a try to being solo, of course, it will not be like call of duty or medal of honor, it will be... an unique close-to-real warfare experience. the game has few guns, but they are unique and can make a difference. the variants are extended, making it a huge library of choices you can have. the bullets have an unique rendering, and you can have tracers (red, green.), which can be seen and can help to tell a nearby teammate where the enemy is. the vehicles are decent, most are sluggish and it does not really give you a civillian feeling, but it gives out most of the military feeling. many servers to play in, with different modes: altis life, co-op, zeus and so on. you can find a game mode you want, and with the huge quantity of modifications existing around steam and the internet, you will certainly never stop playing, unless tactics or marksmanship isnt your thing. 9.5/10",199.7
"digital deluxe edition buyers should get the map packs for free ,sorta disapointed",37.9

"this game is amazing to play, the modding scene is unreal and the game play is as realistic to war as i have found. however there are some downsides for example when online the game is useless without a mic and gets boaring without a friend, also you do need a beastly pc to run at high graphics settings, and still you will find lag spikes when in a city or when there is alot going on, but overall i would recomend this game for hours of fun and to those who like a challange.",37.4

"cant tell you if you should buy it or not, but i can tell you this. you will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have. but when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, its something magical you just cant find in any other game. arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. you buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. arma is a game which you can never called finished. there will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! ill give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back. read: i will not accept random friend requests! if you have a question, please post it in the comments.",919.3

"the best action game made yet (in my opinion). with mods its really cool to create your own missions/scenarios becasue you can build pretty much everything you want to, the only bad side is that the editor map can be difficult in the beginning but when you have learned how it works the game will be fantastic",539.3
"this is not your typical shooter, it is more of a simulation game with firefights usually at football feild lengths away unlike the close quarter battles in cod or moh. this is not a shooter with tightly scripted fights and cynimatic bravado, it is a sandbox game in the truest sense of the word especially with the games support of the mod community. if you have basic scripting knowledge or patience then the game opens new possibilities with the fantasic mission editor that alows you to set up single and multiplayer firefights in minutes. lastly the multiplayer is fun though i find multiplayer is better at a smaller scale with friends on custom missions though if you can get into a warefare game it is a lot of fun playing a large scale realistic rts/fps.",126.4

"is arma 3 for everyone? no arma 3 is a military simulator with more emphasis on realism than action or fun. those who enjoy the experience will find it incredible, but i would recommend doing some research beforehand to make sure the game is right for you. the good: - incredibly detailed open world-style maps - wide range of weapons, vehicles, and equipment - incredibly powerful editor and high mod compatibility with a large community always creating new content. - top notch graphics that will strech even the most hardcore gaming pc the bad: - very high system requirements, dont expect to get a good frame rate without a decent system - network issues can be an issue from time to time - though much improved over arma 2, the character movement and vehicle handling can be clunky and a bit glitchy at times. overall i would say arma 3 is a very good game that will continue to only get better over time as the community and the developers create more and more content. however, if youre on the fence about it, make sure you do some reasearch before jumping into this title.",361.9
"this is a military sandbox game ive never seen before..with mcc 4 mod i can make my own custom mission easily. but i dont know how to make a character modelling as a new unit. im not a 3dsmax / blender expert so can anyone show me the way to do so..actually now i want the indonesian armed forces pack so bad..",177.8
"very good game, i would highly recommend this to anyone that likes a semi-realistic war sim. this game struggles heavly from optimization issues. i have an i5 3570k at 4.4 ghz and a gtx 760. at best this game will use 60% of my cpu and or gfx card and only getting 25-40 fps at 1920x1080 in a busy server. in single player i can get up to 80-90 fps. changing my gfx settings really wont change my fps more than about 10%. 9/10",92.8

"the broadest and most comprehesive military shooter available. if your willing to learn the possibilities of what kind of mission you create are endless. there are a few bugs but nothing is as open or accessable as far as doing what you would like how you would like. no handholding, and no invisible walls. this is a proper pc game, minimal priofit milking compared to ea, or activision. unfettered and not locked down. you want to lan, you can lan, no peer to peer served limited to 4 or 2 coop games, no locked server files. play with who you want when you want you want to make your own campaign, go for it. you want to make a mission type, go for it. you want to model a specific vehicle or weapon, its daunting but go for it. theres bugs, and valid complaints that havent been fixed like in any series, but this is the most consistently dev supported series available, i think arrowhead is still receiving updates. you wont see that from dice or any of the other big devs around. for utilizing the pc as its meant to be utilized alone, bohemia interactive should get your dollars. as far as gameplay goes think a smoother swat 4, with less emphasis on cqb.",661.6

"having played this game a lot, ive decided to give it extremely possitive feedback, and i need to review a game to get an award.. so .. this game is really good for people who like to mix fun with realism. 9/10 due to the physics being a bit dodgy ie falling and dying off of a 1m stair case.. but overall a great game filled with a lot of hard effort from the devs",297.2

"arma 3 is a miltary simulator through and through, but unlike most simulators arma 3 has a campaign with in-depth story to boot and competitive mp thats more then decent. the ai is of a standard above what most games have to offer out there and each weapon, ground or aireal vehicle strive to give as realistic experience as can do when operating said equipment. weapons need to be zeroised and as per actual warfair artillery or mortars need to be given a grid reference (gr) before effective fire can be achieved; and you yourself can operate fire support weapons. the campaign is set into episodes and each episode has just below ten missions that offer a challenge in every aspect. although your ai teammates need to be babysitted somewhat and the game could use some more optimisation but thats a small price to pay in a game that is overall great. i score this game a 8.5/10.",38.0

"very fun game! it takes some getting used to and you need to know strategy in order to prevail. it doesnt take long to learn the game either. this game is quite realistic with its weaponry, vehicles, and physics. a workshop in this game means more ways you can experience it allowing you to play player-made missions, player-made game modes, player-made whatever really. you can also install mods from a website called armaholics which adds a higher score in my rating to the game.",66.9
"i love this game. there is so much you can do with it considering how flexible the simulation is. bullet physics are realistic and it is really satisfying when you get that kill. i highly reccomend it if you have friends to play with or are looking for a large amount of teamwork, because this game is great for that. now i just need someone to play with..",176.6

"feels like i wasted my money. game looks beautiful, but it got too frustrating when it felt like everyone else was going on with the mission and combat, and i was left looking around for the enemy. outisde of waiting for some tracers to show up and give the enemy away, my efforts to eliminate my target were futile 99% of the time. id use up all my ammunition, and theyd land in a perfect shot, every single time. it got to the point that i would end up sitting back while the ai on my team took care of it- after all, they knew exactly what to do while im just sitting there shrugging my shoulders. this is not your typical combat fps. the controle are wonky, and i spent a hard-earned $60 on frustration. i have a titan video card. it runs all of my games on maximum settings flawlessly. with arma 3, it seems like all i do to ajust the graphics settings makes no difference, as im hit with major framerate issues. after a few days, i reinstalled the game to give it another chance, but i just couldnt get anything accomplished. i personally dont recommend the game.",1.0

"well i got this in alpha release when it was $30 but if i didnt i would gladly pay the full price for it. awesome game i definately got 3 times my value that i invested in it and i am getting more!!! the updates will  your internet but they come with huge content. the developers are really giving people their worth in both time and money. easily becoming a better shooter then any cod game and is even leading the hard to beat bf series. my score: 10 out of 10 and it just got out of beta!!! cant wait to see what else the developers add to this!!",9.3

"ive been playing for a few hours and to be honest, i dont really see what all the hype is about. its not a fun game. its a simulator of how much it sucks to honestly go to war. ill keep playing and hope that i like this game later, at least enough to possibly recommend it.",3.0
"game uses battleye, which recently banned me without reason. (you read this and go yeah yeah, stop cheating. but i am a very competitive player and i dont cheat. sucks that you can go buy arma 3 (60 dollars) arma 2 co (20 dollars) and dayz (30 dollars) to have battleye ban you for absolutely nothing. 110 dollars down the drain.",228.8
"awesome game, loads of scope and community content. this game actually does have epic online battles if you know where to look!!",343.7
"absolutely love this game so far! spent hours and hours only on a3wasteland and i have yet to try other mods with friends! optimizing the game for good fps is a little tricky (considering im running 2x 970s in sli and a 4790k...) but once you hit the sweet-spot in the settings menu, you are ready to go. like any other games by bohemia interactive, it takes a while to grasp the controls and over-all feel of the game. having previously played over 400 hours of standalone, i thoroughly enjoy the vehicle and base-building aspects of game modes like a3wasteland (atha & daddy) which is a hell of an experience when playing in a small or even large group. i recommend the [amg] a3wasteland par antha & daddy server as i have enjoyed every second on that server. overall: 9/10.",136.1
"it took them far too long to polish this turd for me to recomend anything bis is involved with. yeah the game is ok now that they have finally added the features that should have been there from day dot, but i bought a physical copy of the deluxe edition from eb and as such i expected a finished game, not the alpha/beta i was confronted with. it should never have been on shelves 6 months ago let alone when i bought it back in 2013. and you would think deluxe edition implies that at least *some* of the dlc would be included. nope. not sodeluxe then is it? imagine buying a new car, and on your way out of the dealership the shady salesman casualy states oh just so you know even though you have a dashboard, none of the dials or switches work. but as soon as we get some in we can install them for a nominal fee. seems a bit rude dosent it? paying for something and realizing it dosent even come close to expectations. and the excuse why not just use mods is just a sad way of admiting the game isnt finished and/or it isnt any good on its own. and even though i may pick it back up and try again i really dont see myself spending anywhere near the time i had intended to as the experience has left a very bitter taste in my mouth.",15.0
"i spent $60 to get alpha and then they repay loyfans with content that they cant even use   you arma3",415.2
"what a brilliant game. this has got to be one of the best games in my library without a doubt. firstly the altis life (gamemode in game) is f*cking awesome! ive never seen role play like it. there is very minimal rdm (random death match otherwise known as kosing) which is rare in a game like arma. in no other game, can you go up to someone, pretending to be an undercover police officer, tie his hands with zip ties, rob him, take his clothes and cut out his kidney classing the whole thing as standard police prosedure what a game xd graphics: 9/10 altis life: 9/10 community: 9/10 realism: 9/10 overall: 9/10",159.3

"this game is great... although the mods are much better then the vanilla arma 3.. try them all. i recommend breaking point.. recently won 4th mod of the year 2014, and was the only arma mod in the top 10. its amazing.. the game is great but the modding makes it fabulous! good luck, have fun, dont read the bad reviews.. and get it now! there is alot of bambis on the bad reviews!",491.6
"i have a love/hate relationship with this game. the action menu needs to die, the people on the game need to shove a big black  in their mouth and choke on it and a lot of other  that i wont go into. other then all that, this game looks spectacular, the most realistic game i have ever played. on my rig it looks absolutely ing beautiful, you need a beast of a computer to run this game and see its true potential. this is the closest thing to real life as far as gaming comes along. also, i cant tell you how many hours i have into this game and ive only had it for about a month! arma 3 is a must have, get this game now, if you dont have this game youre missing out on hours of fun!",640.4

"its a fun game if your pc can handle it, if it cant then i dont recommend it but overall its really good with great gameplay. if you cant run arma 3 i suggest looking at arma 2 oa, if you get that with arma 2 free on bohemias website, you can merge the files and you get loads of maps weapons and vehicles on a easier to run game that still has an active modding community. [update]: although its a good game, i have a few issues with it. the physics, say youre in a suv and you drive full speed into a plastic mesh fence or whatever... you will die, just sayin",493.6

"the game by itself isnt that fantastic. the graphics and gameplay are good, but it isnt worth the price. using the breaking point mod adds a whole new depth into the game and i would strongly recommend downloading it if you have the arma iii game. overall i recommend it because i havent regretted buying it for $60 and therefore hope you feel the same if you buy it. (best to buy it on special though)",18.3

"i think the game is alot of fun couse of there being so many mods and that makes it a large amount of different styles of the game and that makes the game worth buying in my opinion. there just comes out more and more type of mods for the game, some of them are good and some of them are not as good. the mods i like the most is the rp/life mods. the game looks good in my opnion and its worth buying if u like a game were there is alot of different things to do in it.",123.3
"used to not have a lot of guns but its constantly improving. its the most fun with friends but still a lot of fun alone. i would give it a 10/10 but because of the framerates and flying goats ill give it a solid 0/10",216.8

"incredible graphics and amazing gameplay, thats arma in a nutshell. this time they have hit the mark, and by that i mean presenting a game that can utilize the best in the latest hardware. for me its the i7 2011 pin with a gtx 660ti, on a asus rog rampage-iv formula. i dont recommend using anything less than a decent gaming rig for this one, it doesnt need to be the best but pay attention to the graphic demand and ensure you use a good card. im absolutely hooked on this new direction that bohemia interactive have taken, all the traditional game play is still present as well as many new twists, a nicely built mission editor and of course, that very impressive scenery. my only gripe, and its not really relevant here, is that this game could really use clickable cockpits and vehicle controls, imagine having the best in eye-candy and adding a real sim feel to it,,, hinnnt to the moders :) buy this one, dont even bother dwelling on it folks, its a must have even for the offline players.",19.9
"this game is very fun, but battle eye is a pain. they globally banned me for my cd key being stolen and my account was used for hacking. they told me it was my own fault for get my account hacked and my cd stolen. battle eye is a horrible company and i have no idea why any one uses their serves. if i was you i wouldnt get the game because you will probably get banned in the next week and waste $60. this game is not worth your time or your money.",18.9
"this game is brilliant but has decent system requirements. i cannot play the game on high settings however i can still enjoy it regardless. if you are the kind of person that wants to have the capacity to create an infinite variety of scenarios for yourself as i am, this is a great game to play. the game is difficult and brutal, you can freely make your characters look like a civilian or a hardcore military operative. you have a staggering amount of freedom in this game and lots of strategic options involving vehicles including atvs, helicopters, tanks, and even uavs. the maps are extremely large and the game does not fail to deliver on any point.",1.2
"this game makes me cry out of my ears. it is very fun to play and is fun to annoy the crap out of people who play the game serious. i give this game a 10.000012/10 rating.",576.2
"this game is buggy as , have fun clipping through walls and spawning outside of the map, physics... its like from one of those indian movies, if you hit something you gonna feel the impact after few seconds. do not buy this game.",3.3
"after recently playing a lot of arma ii, mainly on the game modes island life and wasteland i decided that i absolutly must have this game, and when it went on sale this summer sale (2014) i snatched it up right away; and i can tell you i do not regret it a single bit! wasteland is a little different to what i was used to on arma ii after only playing it for a short while but fun nethertheless, zeus is where the game has really caught my attention! read up on zeus and give it a shot, you wont regret it if you want more depth to a shooter.",38.2
"so real, so customizable, could really do with more guns in the default game itself though.",29.1
"i simply have nothing more to say than that this is the most fun i have ever had in years. i got very addicted to this game in so very little time to where the point i got over 30 hours in the first week of playing and i am still playing the game for 3-5 hours a day. 10/10 would pay $60 to play, or if you get it for $30 in which i did, still 10/10 would pay $30 to play.",67.4
"extremely enjoyable game but its still arma and it still has the horrible desync and lagginess. altis life is extremely good except for some servers which have lots of bandits. normal campaign is quite fun but very time consuming. the challenges are good except a bit glitchy as you cant seem to complete some of them. other than that its a very solid game that you can put many hours into!",66.7

"if you are looking for a real army simulator, then youre on the right place arma 3 is the best army simulator experience you ever wanted with a good story line and the freedom to choose to do everything you want, there are no straight checkpoints, you aint going to be shooting at a enemy for 2 hours one bullit could kill you depends on where you get shot. this is straight away just the best militairy game ever made you have the freedom to do everything with the content creator. the only question you should ask yourself is.. why did it took so long to have this game!!! its worth the money. especially with online multiplayer on a big map with the freedom to do anything with anyone. see you in the battlefield!",249.6
"now this game is a complicated one to review. on its own its nothing really (and definately not worth 35.00) but with all of the mods made by the community, arma 3 has definately saved. the mods that i would personally recommend you get for this game are: arma 3: breaking point, arma 3 battle royal and arma 3: life mod.",4.6
"this is by far the best war game/sim i have ever played/rp. there are so many addons and things too! great job!",295.3
"great game with an insane amount of re-playability! super user-friendly, especially if youve played arma 2 for some time, as most things are identical (controls wise). some great mods to play, nice engine, decent fps and vac and trackir supported! if youre looking for a great combat simulator or just want a fun sandbox game to mess around on, then arma 3 is the game for you!",890.2
"this game is a must have if you like milsim. it is very realistic, and has a great community. wasteland is for those who enjoy killing everyone in sight even if they are wearing the same camo. deathmatch is meh. coop missions are some of the best game modes. if you are new to the series, check this out, the controls are a little strange at first, but you will grow to love them.",570.2
"this game is a massive improvement to the series. both the visuals and the gameplay have received a complete makeover, while still being very recognisable to anyone familiar with the arma series. especially cqb is more fun now, with the reworked controls, stances and ballistics (barrier penetration). vehicles also received some attention, now with realstic physics. another nice addition is the underwater gameplay, it adds a whole new dimension to the game. contrary to its predecessors, the campaign has a very good storyline and is more immersive. at this moment, theres still less third party content available than for arma 2, but im sure this will improve over time.",196.9
"game crashes a lot but its fun. stop crashing pls.",94.7
"singleplayer is an exercise in pain on high difficulty. game overwrites autosaves and limits you to 1 save. prepare your body for an autosave with grenade launcher rounds inbound forcing you to restart. great roguelikelike.",70.3
"loved it, after the success of cooking mama and league of legends the developer activision shines down on us with the masterpiece that is this game (gears of halo thef auto 5) and with its staggering 69 dlc packs all priced at $4.20 youd be a fool not to try this game out. insomniac games really outdid themselves on this one. 8/6 would eat without package.",388.8

"best friggin game ever. been playing arma 2 for years now. will play arma 3 for years to come. if there is an aspect about this game you dont like, then theres probably a mod for that! seriously, check out mods like arma 3 life, epoch or breaking point. arma 3 is not just a fun game by itself, but the mods make this any gaming experience you want it to be. if you like fps, this is really the only game you need!",102.3

"if your pc can handle it, buy the game! its the combat sim, with as much depth as you choose to look for. a truly peerless take on war and all of its facets, and go-karts...... joking aside, forget op-fp, arma and this games well worthy little brother arma 2 (that brought dayz into being), the only way is up, and the only way is onward.... that means arma 3 so unless arma 4 is due within months, forget cod, bf, farcry, dayzsa and any shooter going, this is the only worthy title from the last generation, and will be here for years to come. get it on sale (about 20) and you will not be dissapointed for months to come (perhaps years?)",6.1

(the alpha is still buggy, has some ai issues and balancing issues. it is also short of content. do not expect a campaign or full featured game until release)",143.1
"im going to make my review as short as possible. arm is a monster of a game, and a damn good one to. if you are not willing to put time into the controls and gameplay you will be bored and frustrated quickly. from what i have found, the community is very mature, the servers are good and the gameplay is suspenseful. we have not seen any game like this in a long time, there is an insane amount of content, the graphics are amazing, and the feeling is absolutely pinpoint what it is meant to be. i coudnt recomend this more to the people who are interested in the idea 9/10",67.1
"if you have to read a review of arma 3 to decide whether or not to jump in, buy the game.... seriously.. youve played shooters before im sure, and youve thought to yourself i wish you could do _______ enter arma 3, where doing _________ is what you do.. whatever you can imagine, you can do... if it doesnt come out of the box, someone has probably made it. mods, team play, and strategy is what its all about.. youre not usually playing against other players... instead you play with other players, against some of the most realistic ai i have ever seen.. all arma games to date have been amazing, but arma 3 takes a leap, simplifying the controls, while providing more and exciting options for the seasoned player.. it is truly the culmination of all weve wanted in a decade of arma... buy it.. youll love it.. there are too many features to list here, but lets just say, youll get in, and youll never get out...",182.2
"very good game. if u like military simulation. lots of awesome mods like altis life, epoch ,battle royale ect. i would suggest buying this game and it also has an awesome map editor and workshop where the possibilities are endless from creating your own mission with ai to fal ling from 10000 meters and skydiving!",363.9
"just... get it... just get it.... you need this.... 10/10 no doubt",222.0
"having owned this since the alpha, i can say i highly recommend it. this beautiful game brings not only fantastic single and multiplayer modes, but stunning graphics as well. it has a much better optimization than arma 2, but is also more graphically intensive due to being a newer game. modding community is very developed and mods are plentiful. breaking point mod highly recomended for those who enjoy dayz. all together an amazing game and a huge step-up from arma 2.",287.9

"i have not bought this game (yet) but i played it in the free weekend. i loved it, i love how realistic it sounds. sure the no bipods are a little bit annoying. but the game is continually tweaked and small things will be added in due time. i am a big fan of sound effects, and arma 3 delivers them on a silver  platter with the best poutine in the world. the purchasing factor on this game was sound effects. after about 5 minutes i found my way into an artillery. then i fired it. oh my god, i felt the rumble in my feet (subwoofer on my desk) and the bang in my ears. arma 3 is the best game if you want the best sound effects in a shooter. battlefield, call of duty, and world of tanks, dont even come close to this level of sound effect quality. arma 3 is in a class of its own, and when i say that i mean that there is not even a teacher because all the other games have to take from arma 3 in order to be in that class. for me? this is hands down the game of the decade. this game is awesome in sound, graphics, mechanics and realism. i would buy the  out of it",72.6

"what do i think of arma 3, well i have mixed emotions. i belive its a good game, but there are alot of reasons i dont play it as often. first for it being the game coming out after the previous arma 2 i was expecting certian things to be added, like better ai, a physics engine, and a much better map. i think i expected a little to much. some ups about the game is its fun! yeah get it like srlsy",150.5
"its arma and thats what ruins this game. well ruin might be a strong word actually but thats not the point. the point is; whilst arma 3 is an enjoyable exeperience with its fancy guns and new physics, it really doesnt do anything to improve upon arma 2. i mean, theres plenty of new content and nice new graphics but it doesnt feel like much of an improvement in the way the game works. while i dont mind the action menu system i can see how it could be considered counter intuitive and that is the problem. the game has a learning curve that can make it difficult to enjoy and while i dont like games being dumbed down, i do enjoy them being made more accessible. the system used in arma is what puts a lot of players off and i dont think its particularly justifiable, as soon as bohemia change this they will see an increase in the playerbase. after that messy blab about the games system i do want to say i still wholeheartedly recommend the game, its great fun and worth a play.",16.3
"if you have to read a review of arma 3 to decide whether or not to jump in, buy the game.... seriously.. youve played shooters before im sure, and youve thought to yourself i wish you could do _______ enter arma 3, where doing _________ is what you do.. whatever you can imagine, you can do... if it doesnt come out of the box, someone has probably made it. mods, team play, and strategy is what its all about.. youre not usually playing against other players... instead you play with other players, against some of the most realistic ai i have ever seen.. all arma games to date have been amazing, but arma 3 takes a leap, simplifying the controls, while providing more and exciting options for the seasoned player.. it is truly the culmination of all weve wanted in a decade of arma... buy it.. youll love it.. there are too many features to list here, but lets just say, youll get in, and youll never get out...",182.2

"i highly recommend arma 3 if youre into army games with a (high) sense of realism. you can make this game as awesome as you want yourself. depending on which (modded) gamemodes you play or with who youre playing. im part of one of the largest arma 3 clans out there (joint task force 2) and it really adds to the experience, having a tactical realism based clan. think of stuff like basic training, military rank structure, working with a chain of command, teamplay based on military tactics and manoeuvers etc. check us out over at",584.7

"seemed pretty fun, but i think it would be much better if it was actually optimised and able to get more than 25 frames. its way to arcadey, and took arma 2s barebone flight mechanics and somehow made it worse. barely anyone online (probably playing their $30 mod) too. playing this game makes me want to be a ing terrorist, so i could do the world a favor and kill the team at bi who made this. 9.999999999/10 its alright",8.4

"first impression - nice graphs, what i mean it is epic nice, on the other hand, hard to get familiar with inventory, selection stuff, but all in all it is worth price. ....so only few words about this awsome goodness. way better than arma2, if you think your computer cant handle this game. trust me it can, even if arma2 were lagging for you. :)",345.4

"fun, tactical interesting war simulator. variety of online/singleplay gameplay!",800.2

"good god, the realism in this milsim is just incredible! bullet drop, survival, and the ai is just great! arma 2 was good, but this, this is amazing! only thing is, the ui is a little hard to adjust to as i am a black ops 2 and bf3 and bf4 player as well. 99.7/100",6.3

"ai is deadly accurate no matter what obstacle, trees, bushes, walls, it doesnt matter, every helicopter gunner as aim like a crack sniper and with one hit kills. friendly ai is dumb as a sack of door-knobs controls are very complex, combine this with poor auto save implementation and this quickly becomes a no-win nightmare which will force you to reload an entire mission, most of which take an hour or more to complete. unless you have 30 or so buddies to play multi with, i recommend you pass.",19.2
"this was my first arma game and it was amazing the controls are not hard but not the easiest this game is probly te best game i have ever played in gameplay but..... now it crashes to the point i cant play any multiplayer but other than that its amazing i think anyone who likes shooters and roleplay games should buy and play this game at least try it sometime",588.4

"arma 3 is definatly easily my favorite game of all time, it produced an unforgetable experience, it showed stunning visual gamplay along with a brilliant engine that works very well with the game, it has a massive selection of weapons and vehicles. the community of arma 3 is amazingly massive, there are tons of gamemodes and servers just waiting to be played on. it comes with a campaign that is entertaining and well developed. it also has a gigantic workshop community with new weapon skins, vehicles and all sorts being added each day. this game is simply fantastic and well worth every penny. 10/10",253.0
"buy it on sale for $30 or less. game would be worth it in that case.",8.8
"biggest waste of cash in a long time. so poorly optimised that i can hardly get over 6 fps, and i know for a fact that the issue is not my computer. would certainly not recommend until bohemia optimises this game, although, judging by arma 2, that may never happen.",22.2
"this game is an incredibly good one, but like past bohemia works it has a long path ahead of it. do not go into the steam community hub for this game, it is a disgusting look at overrivliged and spoiled children who dont understand how the game works they expect it to run like triple-a action shooters. the reality is arma is a military simulator: your character can get hurt from non combat experience, he will become incredibly exhausted after running and carrying heavy gear, one bullet from any range can cause him to bleed out, it take time and patience to make a shot over 500m away. the vehicle combat requires multiplayer players, if your driving youll need a gunner and a crew chief to spot targets for the gunner. helicopters are fragile and take practice for good maneuvering and landing. part of combat is the journey from your base to the ao, it can be anywhere from 2-25+ minutes of no combat. to enjoy this game you need to give it time, the studio is still releasing content (free content) on an almost bi-weekly basis. if you dont like the game than i recommend keeping quiet about and maybe return in a year or two. for better opinions on arma 3 go to the arma 3 community website, this steam hub is just a cesspool, much like how the a2:oa hub turned into a dayz orgy a year ago",160.6
"beautiful graphics, massive scale (terrain is huge and plenty of weapons and vehicles to use). the game has a growing mod support, gametypes like wastland, battle royale, king of the hill and domination gives the game a big lifespan, where boredom is a hard thing to find. the requirements are a bit demanding, but with an old phenom processor and gtx 660, i run the game fine.",241.8
"great game would buy again. very happy with gameplay",415.4
"call me stupid, close minded, or awful at this game. i read the reviews, plenty of people said you either love it or hate it. welp. i tried joining 3 or 4 games. it was buggy as all get out. i clipped through random crap, there was no meaningful tutorial, the controls were confusing, and the maps seemed huge once i managed to join. i had no idea what i was doing, most of the guides were either in cyrillic or were mentioning some game mode, nothing outlining the basics. im not usually one to say something is overcomplex and walk away, but  this game is hard to enjoy. ill take another crack at it im sure, because i did just sink $40 in to this that i can never have back, but id advise others to avoid purchasing, even if you arent a filthy casual like myself. because damn. this game is stupidly obtuse.",11.3
"ive only played this in wasteland but i would say it is amazing.",38.4
"game is pretty cool and detailed ... but its aparently going down the pay for any extra content road im a cheapskate ... paying for extra model just make me sick .... if they would come out with actual add-on ie wait a year or two finish singling out every issue with your engine then come out with a dlc adding a bit of everythng + some mission i m on thats fine by me id buy but here the game does not feel finished to me maybe they need to come out with more dlcs .... just my opinion",71.7

"the core game ill give it 5/10 soley for its engine. the campaign is rubbish, its cod on steroids. id even say arma2 campaign was better then this, atleast the first few missions were before it went to warfare but i digress. arma 3 with rhs and a good multiplayer clan (coop) will blow your mind. may i suggest blastcore and tfradio to complete your wargame experiance. bis take note.",609.2

"i recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter. this game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game. controls are most fluid then arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical. it does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre. every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like rl. i didnt log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the sc (sector control) game mode and its fantastic. you gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear. il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update.",141.9

"arma 3 is a good composed game. i couldnt stop playing since it merges you into a intense war atmosphere. it was cool getting into a car with a bunch of people and riding to kill an enemy group on altis life rpg (one of the many cool gamemodes). some things that you will need to get used to is walking and not seeing action for a while (which make those fights 10 times better). but if you want a zombie survival type of gamemode do epoch (which is pretty fun). also another gamemode is sandbox, which you go into a world with a bunch of people and test and monkeying around with the vechiles and guns (helps you get used to the gun physics). arma 3 is a good for 59.99$ when it includes 4 different gamemodes. also would like to state this game wont be like any other shooter you will ever play hope you think my review was helpful. (warning the game will crash your pc if you dont have the requirements)",12.6

"this is, hands down, the best military simulator available. there is a steep learning curve and its not very plug and play, but a3 can deliver an incredibly rewarding experience if authenticity and realism are up your alley. the arma series has proven to be both a fun combined arms shooter as well as an invaluable training tool.",121.5
"single player is good and runs pretty well, but the multiplayer is the most laggy thing in the world. i dont know why, i pass the recommended requirements. so this is why i would not recommend it.",10.3
"arma 3 continues on the merits of the original operation flashpoint and while many additions imply much welcomed improvements throughout, the core of the issues remain unresolved, leaving complexity rather than depth. it is the best version of the sandbox/editor/experiment, but as a game, it is still the flawed mess that the original flashpoint introduced back in the days. atleast flashpoint had the excuse of originality being it was the first of its kind when released, which leaves arma 3 to nothing more than minor improvements in an environment that requires massive enhancements. buy if the previous titles meant something to you to the extent of wanting to experience them in a slightly newer engine. avoid if you expected them to actually make a game of quality.",50.8

"brilliant game i give it a 10/10 because i look past the nitty gritty that people are always on about when it comes to this game and i fully believe that the creaters and the company do not get the credit they deserve...... think about it, its a game which the map is near enough the same geographical size of an actual island which exists and it holds so much detail and it has so much to offer... if you think differently im sorry but your life must be one of the most negative people to walk this earth lol..... i have heard people complain about the graphics for this game and to be honest i find them very good what more can you expect from a game with a map that size were every thing has to have detail. another thing, the singleplayer in this game is absolutly genius (to me anyway).... all in i would fully recommend this game to anyone. its definitly worth the money.... i cant believe people would pay like 50 for games like call of duty and then complain about the price of this one, if anything it should be the other way round.... anyways i hope that if you get this game, you will get the same enjoyment as i did and still do. :)",35.5

"arma 3 offen used as a combat sim for clans can be boring and demanding but the game itself is great the game looks and feals like an open world combat game, with that being said the community behind it are very much the weakist link in the game modders clans and servers all think they own the game they like to play i am higher ranked then you! moders dont code in the best way they can and then lie about what the games engine can and cant do, there are fine pepole out there playing this game but mp is as with every other game full of pepole you would like to punch in real life. is it worth the money? for single player alone this game is worth it and mp/mods are the 2th best thing in the game if you liked arma 2 you will also like arma 3. arma 3 is only an upgrade to the already great arma 2 new maps and content leave this game fealing freash and new. the one thing i hate the most about the game is the fact that it is based on prototype tanks planes atc they are not real! and this leaves the game fealing like a peace of the future not what i like imo",183.7

"arma iii: pros: + most realistic military simulation / shooter there is on the market + unlimited stuff to do/to try => endless fun + really big maps + buggy as hell (trademarks of arma) cons: - buggy as hell (but still, they are annoying) - needs alot of good hardware to work properly. (im playing with 30 fps standard) evaluation: armas trademarks are the bugs in this game. youll get used to them and sometimes they are really funny. anyway, this game makes just fun when played on a high-tech computer, otherwise you may get depression. conclusion: it is really worth every buck, because if you play with friends its undefeatable fun.",244.8
"arma 3 compared to arma 2 is a big improvement for sure, but it stills has a few issues and features that where in arma 2 that i would have liked to see in arma 3. overall its pretty good now since there are some great mods that have come out.",472.8
"this game is very good. to start off i have started the campaign. but i spend most of my time on breaking point. i run settings at ultra and get around 60 fps. multplayer maps are twice to sometimes 4 times as big as the largest map in battefield. any map can be created by any user im you own zeus. this game just keeps getting better and better as i play it.",22.4
"amazing game so far and its only an alpha! updated and improved on so many things from previous arma games. if you like miltarty simulators this game has you covered; infantry, boats, vehicles and aircraft. huge maps (20km) and you can pretty much go in to any building now! in short, pre-order this game :d",119.5

"best first person shooter ever made. it has the best detail along with gameplay. even though its still in beta i think its still a 5 star game. the developers really put some thought into this game you have the best graphics especialy if your computer can handle ultra. now for some gameplay i really like wasteland if you get this game grab some friends and play some wasteland.",151.7

"you enter combat with your team/squad, hop in a chopper, fly to destination, parachute in, forget to pull chord, fall to death. would jump again 10/10. in all honesty, i would say get this game. its hard to learn, but it gets so good once you learn how, and you get into a combat zone, and bullets are wizzing by, jets flying overhead, and then you hear an explosion, and the house on the next block is destroyed.",193.7

"arma 3 is a great game if you loved previous chapters and you enjoy combined arms wanna-be simulators. its completely customizable and has an experienced community developing tons of additional content. unfotunately the game suffers from an old engine concept limitations wich makes everything feel clunky and buggy. the single player campaign is one of the worst ever created and doesnt reflect at all what a military operation is but its there so if you want to give it a shot.. plus the plot has almost no effort put in it. arma series fortunately relies for the 1% on single player campaign and 99% on community made content and coop multiplayer wich is the real core of the game. a must have if you want to join a clan that plays this game as a serious simulation.",171.5

"overall the game play is difficult and focuses on real life accuracy making the movement mechanics very frustrating to navigate. unless youre driving a land based vehicle, youre going to find piloting any aircraft a complete nightmare. the game looks great but has a very small variety of weapons to choose from, which in turn makes for some pretty bland game play. the enemies are all crack shots and can hit you from miles away even if youre in a concealed, prone position. i picked this up during a sale recently and still regret the purchase. lesson learned. will be avoiding any future bohemia interactive titles.",4.2

"i say no simply because the arma 3 main game multiplayer (including wasteland) feels like it is still in beta with the amount of bugs, glitches, lag etc. it is worth it for the mods takistan life and altis life but i still wouldnt pay 35 for it. if its going cheap and your tempted? get it, otherwise avoid it. i still enjoy arma 2 more its smoother.",72.6

"pretty fun with a few friends. can be hard to get into at first and understand the layout of different game modes but once you do it becomes competitive, fun and thrilling. being a veteran of arma 2 crossing into arma 3 as well as its friendly dayz counterparts, id suggest this game to mates anytime.",51.5

"great game with great potentional with the modding community. arma 3 engine in itself is an amazing engine with plenty of scripting opportunities for new developers and experienced ones. without the modding community i dont think this game would be as popular as it is, but with the modding community its amazing what they bring to the table in this open world military simulator. between altis life (best described as grand theft auto where humans play every role), to wasteland, and even ahoyworlds co-op capture gameplay, this game has definitive replayability. i really love the dayz epoch mod, and breaking point mod as they both bring their own taste of the post-apocalyptic mayhem to the arma 3 community. now i cant wait for the helicopter dlc and the markman dlc coming soon. realism in flying helicopters and additional mid to long range weapons will just be icing on the cake for this series, and the cake isnt a lie with this one.",777.4
"is a super coll game i played this for the weekend and what can i say i will probably buy this game very very soon :)",30.2
"this has been out some time now, and like all the arma games before it the community just keeps adding stuff to it, which makes the longevity of the game and franchise even bigger and better as there are some really talented modders out there. if youve never played this game or even picked up a demo of this or any of its previous versions then i highly recommend it. if you like war games, both rts and tactical then this game is for you. its not a shoot and run type of game, and not suited to people who love bf and cod type games, this is more a thinking mans game. although the original game lacks any real campaigns or missions, there are plenty of community created ones out there free to download, some good and of course some bad. for those of you who like to design your own missions then dive in to the editor, there is plenty of help out there and the community is thriving and more than willing to help you start.",47.6
"quite a good game to play, the previous armas were good. this game has it glitches but overall it is quite a good game. a lot of game modes are in the game such as altis life or king of the hill. it makes it worth while to buy the game because you can put so many hours in it. the only thing i dont recommend is trying to get into a go-kart if you dont have the go-kart dlc bacause it will pop up continually to try to make you buy it and it is extremely annoying. it will interfer with whatever such thing you are doing. but, overall this is a good game to play and it will make your time worthwhile.",270.7

"when you play multi-player most people do no get over 60 frames per second 20-40 fps is average i would suggest googling average fps arma 3 etc. my pc easily meets the recommended game settings but after doing alot of research it seems like the game is not optimized and people are happy playing a game with low fps. i play alot of first person shooter and fps makes a big difference so be carefull buying this game as i regret it.",6.4

"inredible, a master piece. the military sandbox exceded my expectations, better than its predecesors, arma 3 is as realistic as it gets,with the all setting at ultra, you almost feel as if you were driving the m1a1 or just chillin with your soldiers. just one down feature, the terrain (the grass, rocks, gravel, etc), the detail of it is not the best, but overall i highly recomend it",156.5

"very much a hardcore shooter, and probably closest to a real combat simulator you are likely to find easily on steam. its not easy but if you put in the time to wrap your head around it, its a really good shooter. vehicle integration is great as well. community maps and scenarios are quickly becoming a high quality alternative to the single player campaign.",15.6

"arma 3 was described to me when i first got into it as a military simulation. i can say without a doubt that it portrays a sence of vastness that in my opinion is unmatched compaired with other games that lean into realism. if you are into cod this might not be the game for you. its not particularly fast paced. your going to find yourself on unexpected 10k ruck march from time to time because you were distracted by the scenery and hit a wall and popped the tire on your vehicle. but when the action happens and it will. your going to find yourself in the most intence and realistic firefight you will ever have and you just wont find this expierence in another game. i will say this game has a very steep learning curve. i highly reccomend taking the tutorials and practicing before you enter a server to run and gun. at the time of writing this review i have over 200 hours logged and its still every bit as exciting as it was when i first started to play it. i bought this game on sale but i would happily buy it for full price. it is worth every single cent.",215.7

"terrible optimization, controls, plot and animations. most of servers have white list so they will kick out as you join them. when you find a good server all you play is a walking simulator and not a war game. i am not a call of duty or battlefield fan but i think they are good games if you compare them to this. also, people pretend this war game is realistic. no, its not. the only realistic thing is the boredom",2.1

"initially, i bought this game because i wanted to play wasteland or something coming from arma 2. this was back in alpha. it sucked , and i left the game to collect dust for a long time, then one day when it finally got released, a whole new gaming experience overwhelmed me! completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer, and due to one of the latest updates being zeus it has made gaming to a whole new level. since becomming a fan of the arma 3 i now own 2 servers for a community named stdelta. its the most fun you could have with a war simulator you could ever have your hands on. would definately reccomend this game to any gamers looking for a challenge in their gaming. live long and drop the the floor and do the dinosaur. ~hash",577.8

"great game !!! one of the games i never get bored with. huge territory, a freedom of play that any other game of its genre never surpassed from the 1st operation flashpoint till todays arma 3. but above all, it is its community players and modders that make it awesome !!! if the single player campaigns can be a bit boring questioning ai (even though i enjoy playing them), the game is very powerful going into multiplayer games. thousands of mods, maps, addons like weapons, uniforms, realistic behaviour (shooting, wounds, medics,), zombie like mods improves ai mods, and so on, i cant write all as it is one of the richest game community i ever experienced. a must have ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! thanks so much bohemia interactive for these many years of fun :d ps: i just have one remark, is that im still waiting for a mac osx version of the game.",284.9

(note: theres a bug that doesnt allow you to go naked) do a back flip in a chopper? get into a tank lav and go down the highway at 100km/h then hit a rock and go flying. and a lot more! who said this was a war simulator you can play this game your whole life and not need to shoot one bullet? remember men play arma! btw: lots of people wont like this game because they dont know what to play on it. find what modes you like or make your own!",564.3

"i like shooter games, and i always saw my brother playing them and they looked very fun. when i was old enough, i got call of duty and had a blast. i kind of expected that kind of fun from this game, but i was dissapointed. even on beginner difficulty the soldiers take 30 minutes to kill, and you take 2 shots to the foot and you are dead whereas you can shoot them in the chest five times and they ill crouch and order their whole squad to fire on you with their unrealistically impeckable accuracy. if you like pulling out your hair and the feeling of overwhelming rage, this is the game for you. if not, you are wasting your money.",7.2
"this is a great game for anyone with experience with first person shooters. you might not want to buy this as your first fps game becasue of the steep learning curve and the amount if controls. but after some time it becomes a lot of fun. i have had a lot of good experiences in this game that i dont think i could get from another fps. it has many cool features that you just cant get from other games, like for example the ability to make use of any vehichle around you and use that as an advantage in the field. or maybe get a laser deignator off an enemy body and use that to mark targets for your friends. there is even gamemodes for roleplay. like altis life, and arma 3 life which can be fun if you like to roleplay with other people. i think the possibilities in this game are endless. you can make your own missions and submit them to the workshop for other people to download and rate, etc. i have had more than 500 hrs in this game and i think every one was a lot of fun. 10/10",577.8

"the game is good. have many thing to do. but now game still lack of the mod i love the most since arma one is warfare mode. which is basebuilld around you to buy unit and explore the map and conquest the town i didnt said game was bad. im still that there will be official release for the warfare mode. the single player is ok for me. but the setting is not i love modern weapon which current in use like in arma 2 more than those prototye weapon. so this arma is still recommend if you want the simulator game that not hard. i love to drive tank and play infantry in this game , but fly model isnt that good so i didnt fly much but it easy enough to fly anyway and if you have friend to play with it awesome as developer including zues mode !!! if you dont want to play with mod this game dont have much thing like arma2 so wait more a bit i believe developer will release more content !!",56.4
"if you like strategic military combat in a vast open world, then get this game. if u like battlefield, then youll love this game. i got cod advanced warfare, and played it about an hour, after which i found myself back in the lands of altis wasteland (arma 3). played over 100 hours in the last 2 weeks, seriosly, so get it already.",976.2
"military simulator with a steep learning curve. by far the most realistic shooter ever made. i love the game, but it is no run and gun bf game.",21.4
"this is the best millitary simulator since operation flashpoin. game play takes in account many aspect of real world millitary scenario. complex operations or just a simple single missions with tons of inventory and vehicles.",176.7
"excellent sandbox simulation, but unlike others i will not say it is a total military simulation. vehicles and aircraft and their controls, pathfinding, etc. need vast improvement for this to even be considered a survey sim. however, arma 3 is an excellent infantry simulator and the vehicles and aircraft used as a supporting cast are sufficient. thrown in the community mods, game modes, and missions and nothing can beat arma 3. i just wish the grass was not so cheesy looking when you crawl though it, and the graphics were a bit more cinematic. i guess one cannot have everything.",138.9
"arma 3 is probably the most demanding war game simulation, it is very much focus on teamplay and cooperation. the gameplay is flawless, the graphics are great and the environments are outstanding.",306.7

"i love this game, but i have a screenshaking problem that has persisted over many updates. ive posted in the troubleshooting forum to no avail, and ive looked it up online and tried dozens of troubleshooting processes. nothing has worked. i payed full price for a game i cant play, kinda sucks. r9 280x 6gb, amd fx6300, 8gb ram.",57.8

"launch goats to space with huge amounts of explosives. 10/10.",79.2
"arma 3 is really different from arma 2. it has different key bindings and lot of movements. if you want to play the mod that youutubers play in arma 3 such as atlis life/waste land/breaking point. expect to be not fun as you think. atlis life-cop or rable is hard to join, finding good waste land server is really hard. waste land will continue to get killed and breaking point will be annoy you because of those campers and snipers. if you dont have friend to play with, i recommand you not to buy this game because it will make you boring. remamber, this game isnt funny like youve seen in youtube.",16.8
"played this over a free access weekend, i have a high-end gaming rig so no problems there - liked what i saw. i really wanted this game, but decided to do some research before i pulled the trigger. i really wanted a game that would let me play with modern vehicles. i couldnt wait to jump in an abrams or apache or a leopard 2 or a t-90... or jump in a tunguska to try and shoot down a a-10. i had visions of massive armored battles with supporting infantry, artillery and drones oh my! all with badass graphics, and realism only a simulator can give - beyond the laughable dumbed down versions found in the likes of battlefield and cod. then i came across screenshots of what initally looked like a russian mi-28 havoc (sweet!) with... the dual contra-rotating main rotor blades of a ka-50 hokum?! apparently, arma iii, much vaunted hardcore military simulator doesnt even have real-world vehicles in it. fantasy island nations with ficitious governments to battle in i can handle. completely made-up armored vehicles, tanks and helicopters in a supposed high-end military simulator? no thanks.",1.3
"easily worth the price a military simulator with so many options. if you havent played arma before you will find the controls daunting but once you get used to them the game is great. the other issues can be de sync(lag) and low frame rate on some maps. this can make the game frustrating but the good times in this game out weigh the bad unlike some of the big aaa titles over the last few years. the thing about arma games is the longer they are out the better they get because of the community created mods. arma2 is still a great game which i still play and has a huge following. some of my favourite arma3 mods are wasteland, king of the hill, altis life and many more. you arnt really buying a game you are buying countless options and countless gaming sessions. buy it, this game is on sale often so keep an eye out.",584.3
"this game is still a bit buggy since release but thats to be expected with such a large project. i have a lot of fun playing the campaign but the most fun comes out of the community made gametypes. i definitely reccomend this game!",31.7
"pretty basic until you get mods for it. find a good community of gamers who game regularly and with good mods and this becomes one of the best games youll ever buy. im going to fail my degree because of this game. 10/10",620.1
"a much more refined experience than arma 2, whilst it may have lost some of the charm of the eastern european setting, altis is a frankly astounding technical feat in terms of detail. the episodic campaign may make the price tag seem a little steep, but there is so much more to this game than the singleplayer, the excellent multiplayer and dedicated modding community make this a game that you will continue to play for months or even years after release.",46.1
"good game. can be a little hard for new players but worth the buy",8.9
"i had a friend gift me arma 3 and i always wanted to play it. despite all of the negativity some people give it i enjoy the game myself. there is so much you can do in arma 3 that sometimes it is hard to name them all. having 893+ hours i think it is safe to say i would recommend to anybody. from super serious to very calm game modes arma has it all. if you choose to get arma3, see you on the battlefield.",932.7
"pros: this game is just beautiful. very photorealistic! when i first looked around in the game it was like whoa!. i can max it on my gtx 980 in 2k at around 40-50 fps, multiplayer allows a large amount of people to play on massive maps. the controls are great, you can have total control over you player. weapon accuracy is realistic, you cant hit anything without being tactical. it has a great training section that i advise you play before jumping into a server. cons: the muliplayer... i just dont understand. i admit i havent done any research on how to play, i didnt know i had to. i have not met a friendly entity in any game yet. as of now every encounter with another play has resulted in them shooting me, tazering me or hancuffing me to sell to another more advanced player... there is nothing you can do about it, both the faction and the police have simmilar procedures. there are, it seems, 1k commands. it will take a while of remapping for comfort and accessability, let alone learning the bulk of them. conclusion: it looks great and is the most immersive fps i have ever played. so get it! very taxing game on the graphics card. screen shots look amazing, but the 45fps is not enough to be competative, so i will have to turn down settings =( or buy another 980 =)",5.1
"got this game on a friends recommendation. i tried the life servers. it sucks. the interface blows. plus, i dont feel like mining apples or whatever because i dont feel i should have to buy some kind of license to make dope.",19.8
"amazing game with a huge community behind it. new mods all the time to add new flair to the game. mods soch as breaking point, king of the hill, and acre radios, and more. all this gives into a game that ever changing and once its paid for, all content is free",551.6
"arma 3 has a lot of detail when it comes to its graphics which is good but it can also have some bad points, although it is realistic half the time you cant see your enemies because the sun is in your way. a massive problem with arma 3 is the ai, they are totally un-realistic i once used a sniper to shoot at an ai who took cover on the ground and as it was long distance i missed using a sniper, he stood up and returned fire hitting me with about 3 of his 4 shots. at the distance he shot at it would be impossible with an assault rifle. ive never really found arma as a game i would play by myself because it becomes boring and repetitive especially when you keep dying and most of the game consists of travelling to the battle. i like arma 3 and i would suggest it to everbody because you can have some good times on it. but the game itself needs to have a lot of work for it to be a game i would consistantly play.",52.4
"great game good graphics if u like shooters get this",0.4

"ok this game require to train to fully appreciate it value. the game is not hard but its unforgiving. you will die a tons! it make dark souls look like candy crush. but take the time to learn how to pilot, how to command and install some recommanded ai mod like ffis and i promise you a superb gaming experience. arma3 is unique! but you will never forget your first success. this is no wonder why the community is so productive with this game. you really can simulate anything! just take the time to learn it! its a sure buy ! the only con against this game ? it require a monstrous pc to be played correctly i run a i7 4930k/32gig@2400mhz/2x ati 7970 on an 2560x1440 screen and this is not very fluid i often run between 40-60 fps but nothing more. because the pace is rather slow the fps slowdown is not really a big issue. just be aware of its hardware requirement",33.3
"amazing game, amazing mods. no other game gives you this kind of experience. ive dropped hours in this game and never regretted it. i recommend picking up eridanus insurrection or breaking point/overpoch(take your pick there). little cpu hog, so be careful on that end. amd cpus have issues and if your cpu isnt a decent one youre going to chug along. otherwise worth every penny.",318.1
"although i cant get past the first checkpoint, or get a single kill in the first 2 hours, dont let the difficulty baffle you as there is a lot more out there that meets the eye. not only does arma iii offer you a ginormous sandbox openworld map, it gives you a range of choice between vehicles, weapons and body gear. the intense graphics allow magnificent details which give you the best experience possible of what its like being out in there in the field. as you slowly immerse deeper and deeper into this game, past reminiscences of other fps shooting games from series such as the call of duty and counter strike will fade. however there are still some noticable glitches and bugs but these defects barely affect your gameplay and only give the creators more urge to make this game even more fantastic than it already is. the arma series has really opened the gates to a bridge that connects man to virtual reality and i highly recommend people to buy this game as it is a should buy -- no, must buy game on the steam store.",10.8

"i recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter. this game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game. controls are most fluid then arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical. it does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre. every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like rl. i didnt log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the sc (sector control) game mode and its fantastic. you gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear. il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update.",141.9

"the only problem with arma 3 is... the lack of content. the arma 2 had such a great community and mods and even the game had more guns and armor at the start than arma 3. i just cant understand why devs did not put in stuff like bipods, advanced first aid, helicopter features, portable mgs, and on and on, that arma 2 had. so if you buy arma 3 you get a bit more polished arma, but with the lack of good multiplayer servers and simplicity in game experience. so if you are new to the arma 3 its fine you wont even know what im talking about and go ahead its a great game. but if you were a fan of arma 2 like me, you will just be dissapointed, about the multiplayer content and community pick. and bohemia interactive seems to like ea principles of marketing game. its hilarious that they are trowing out dlcs that enable you so basic thing as a rope hook on a helicopter for 15$! which it should have already be in the game?! so the final tought is still, a good game but the devs ed it up big time. 6.5/10 so wake up bohemia and stop being so lazy and dull to the fan base. and if you have to rip people off with dlcs put at least a fair price of 5$ instead of 15$.",220.5

"arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation. where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community. you will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title. the game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like arma 2 for example. personally i used to be big on the battlefield series but once i started playing arma it was arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter. the depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing. everything fromt he graphics, to physics to sound effects are really good. oh and if you dont want to use the vanilla stuff, again theres mods, even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one. theres also a really fun multiplayer mode called zues, which is essentially dungeons and dragons meets first person modern day shooter. one player acts like the dm and the others play in his / her world. allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly. this one gets my whole hearted thumbs up. for information on how to mod your game, check out this youtube video:",828.3

"dont be turned off by the simulator nature of this game. while the combat is meant to be realistic and when youre first starting out it can be a bit daunting to learn all the controls and simply learn how to aim the game underneath is fantastic. the campaign is a great introduction into the mechanics of the game and id highly recommend playing the survive chapter to get a handle on basic infantry gameplay. the game is extremely moddable and its super easy to make your own missions or to download missions made by other players. the game does have performance issues however and is very cpu bound. i found that with my fx 8350 crossfire is useless and results in no performance gain because the processor cant keep up, but if you have a strong single card solution then an fx 8350 will work fine. intel however is the preferred route for this game, but even then dont expect 60 fps gameplay. that said, the game is slow paced enough that 30 fps is more than sufficient and the game is absolutely gorgeous. id absolutely recommend it if youre a fan of games like americas army (atleast before the most recent iteration) and red orchestra, or mods such as project reality and insurgency.",31.0

"excellent game if you have a half decent pc. people whinge about not much content but i found there is plenty for everything that i need and i believe most people need. if more content is needed, there are plenty to choose from. some of the mods such as breaking point (a zombie game on altis) are far superior to the dayz sa and most dayz for arma mods without the building as yet. i am sure that sa will get better but with patches few and far between it will take some time. arma 3 multiplayer is also very enjoyable with some mates and a few beers. certainly worth it if your into a bit of realism compared to other aa or aaa titles. be patient with the game, the end result is awesome all around.",781.7

"dont let the screenshots fool you. you have to have an amazing computer in order to play like that. for most people, trying to play the game on the higher settings will result in more lag than game. unfortunately on the lower settings the game looks 7 years old. graphics aside the gameplay is excellent and realistic like it should be. the episodic campaign is the biggest downside. it shows quite a bit of laziness on bohemia interactives part. its been almost 6 months since the full release and we still dont have the end of the campaign, also, the campaign isnt very good, but multiplayer makes up for it. i personally love wasteland and altis life. i would recommend purchasing this game primarily for its multiplayer.",354.4

"sick of the same old pvp griefing in other first person shooters? then get yourself and a few friends together and play cooperatively. working together with your mates to complete missions is fun, rewarding and encourages true teamwork. there are literally thousands of missions available in the steam workshop with dozens of new ones each week, giving endless replayability. it is also pretty easy to make your own using the in-built editor. the ai in this game are smart, realistic and unpredictable but also highly configurable to make missions easier or harder to suit your skills. bohemia interactive also have a superb track record of supporting and encouraging community content so there are loads of mods to modify the game setting from subtle to total conversion. it is more complex and sophisticated than other shooters but so much more rewarding. get into it.",778.1

"this game is awesome if you like simulation. this is a tactical army simulator. it has really fun multiplay and a editor where you can create missions, and co-op missions. you can also post your map creation on steam. it does not have many mods on the workshop but i dont think it need alot of mods for a cool game like this. i totally recommend this for anyone that like shooting games. but of course i got my copy on sale for $38.99, or around there but thats the digital one, i think its called something like that. i like this game so much im thinking about doing a series on this game. thank you for anyone for taking the time to read this. :)",124.6

"if someone asks me what is the best game i have ever played, then without contemplation, i will definitely choose arma3. it has the best graphic ive ever seen, it satisfies the ultra-realism ive been looking for (i thought bf series were realistic) and last but not least, it makes gamers to jump into game-making. i doubt games better than this would come out any time because i strongly insist this is the most breath taking and innovative game ive ever seen.",795.1

"its overall not a bad game but for the price i wouldnt recommend it. pros: * beautifully detailed world spaces teeming with wildlife * extremely large maps make for fun and challenging combat as well as virtual site seeing * a nice assortment of weapons and equipment to choose from cons: * poor help system and no tutorial for new players - one was later added but it was not super useful * overly complicated and over numbered controls with a large portion of the keyboard being used as well as the mouse * poor sound effects; especially for guns * for as detailed as the world and npcs are, the guns seem to overall be lacking in both function and appearance * although certainly more realistic than most fps games, the fatigue system is a little troublesome considering how large the world is and how far you often need to travel from objective to objective without a vehicle. even walking with an average amount of gear can almost completely stop your progress fairly fast forcing you to stop and rest overall score from 0 to 10, 10 being the best: 5-6",49.7

"this game looks gorgeous on ultra settings and is great for benchmarking, this game requires a hefty rig to run stable 60fps 1080p which is a big factor on whether you take a risk on purchasing the game if you have a low end system, the multiplayer is very cpu intensive and could lead to unexpected drops of frames even on the most beefy of pcs. this game however is packed with singleplayer content and a large variety of multiplayer modes, the game also features a mission editor so you can make your own missions or download them off the steam workshop. with the peformance issues in mind this still is an amzing game and is worth a fullprice purchase if you have friends which can play with you on it. 9/10 great game but low-medium end rigs or even pcs with a not great cpu be weary.",121.2

"unrefined and jerky -- describes every aspect of this game. even with the settings turned down the animations are horrible and the guns are garbage - i cant even hit a window on the side of a building. bohemia needs to take some pointers from other shooters, refine the animations, fix the guns so they actually can shoot someone, and fix the jerky animations and lag so that whopever you shoot at, is not ghosting and jerking around like someone having a seaizure. i wouldnt even call this and alpha build and this game has been out for years -- no excuses at this point. i want my money back, this game is garbage.",24.8
"i hope most if not all of the bugs and issues there are fixed through beta and release. for an alpha it was very impressive but i feel there is still some work to do to make the game the best it can possibly be and with a price of 19.99 ($32.99   24.99) is almost idiotic to pass up. i imagine on full release that price will go to the normal price for a new game on steam, either 29.99 or 39.99, so get it while its hot.",7.2

"arma 3 is a military simulator. its not supposed to be played like call of duty or battlefield where you run and gun, but you most certainly can. it helps to play this game with other people, because the ai isn;t very helpful. there is also the problem with bugs that come with any arma game. you will break your legs from running around, you will get trapped in the world, and you will get stuck doing simple actions; you will also love every minute of it. when you learn how to deal with these issues, the game is an absolute blast.the draw of the game isnt the base game, it is the mods. just like arma 2, this game will have a long lifespan because of mods like arma life, epoch, battle royale, breaking point... just to name a few. just be sure before to watch some videos or read the instructions on various websites before you mod the game so that you dont have to reinstall your game or spend hours trying to figure out what you did wrong. 9/10 would fly a helicopter into a tank again, bring a friend, but please fix the annoying bugs.",159.5

"this is a awesome game! its a army simulation based game with no white dot on the screen to help you hip fire, you wont be seeing much of that. the vehicles are smooth with a steady internet connection. i would recommend that you practice your flying skills on single player to get the hang of it so when your in battle with 8 guys in the back you know what your doing.",230.0
"you really need to play this to realise what a skillbased shooter is all about. and its fun to boot!",71.6
"this game is enjoyable if you like realistic shooters. probably my favorite game on pc excluding league. arma has the advantage of mods over all other shooters. i highly recommend picking up the battle royale mod which turns the game into a dayz like free for all which is highly enjoyable when working together with friends. well worth 60 bucks although if you missed the sale and youre a friend of mine that i clearly told get arma 3 then you could have gotten more bang for the buck",24.4

"sandbox multiplayer is awesome. dont even bother going to in-game gun stores. grab whatever rifle and equipment you can and make use. i found a submachine pistol and a silencer, a smoke grenade and some glow sticks. left my car running on a busy road at night with the lights on and watched it. surrounded it with glow sticks. killed three people and came away with a decent back pack, rifle and grenade launcher and a ghillie suit. with space to pack my handy little pdw. dont get angry when you get shot after hunting down the perfect kit and have to hike for miles and miles again. downside @ 29/11/14 is there are a lot of hackers at present and its ruining the fun. this game still gets 5 out of 5 stars",180.1
"absolutly amazing army simulator, great with friends if you wanna try something tactical. great game and love the custom maps which people make. very high quality and considered and can keep for entertained forever! great game. 9/10 con: the only con i have is the ai is very skilled when it comes to where you are, they know very much. but thats the only downside i have.",71.0

"so this one is a weird one. on the one hand this game can be an amazing amount of fun whilst playing several different mods already integrated into the system. it is some of the most tense fun ive had in a strategic fps. the game also looks pretty dang good, on the other hand this game screams beta, with bugs a plenty lack of many features that was avilible in arma 2. for example bi-pod integration still hasnt been going in. that alongside the dlc being added even though the game is extremely unpolished. simply put: arma 3 is great but also a big dissapointment from me. 6.5/10 p.s performance is still a huge problem for many people so make sure you can run it!",257.2

"simulation isnt the defining aspect of arma. its scale. the enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish bohemia interactives flagship franchise. its what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an fps. its what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. its what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot. the scale of arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including arma 2. altis, a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. its a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but whats more significant is that armas landscape finally has the technology it deserves.",379.0

"this game costs like $60 now.. but it should cost more .. because its awesome! yee! best graphic game ever see, nice tactics and the best thing is that you can make the mission that you wish for. and post it to others. and also so many missions are already in the workshop. would give the game a 10 out of 10 :o",2.4

"i loved (still love) arma 2: co and arma 3 is a brilliant successor. theyve added a lot of polish to the game, made movement feel much smoother, and really improved the graphics. with steam workshop, new content for the game is just a click away and there are some excellent user-made missions out there. moreover, there are a ton of mods available which can change various aspects of the game. ive put more than 400 hours into arma 3 playing and creating missions and thats just in single-player. i cant recommend the game enough to anyone who likes realistic, open-world shooters. itll be installed on my pc for a long, long time.",633.3
"definitely the best tactical shooter and shooter in general in the last decade. it is very immersive in that you have so many different controls at your disposal which is a little tedious at first but once you learn them you will be wishing every shooter had them. its very realistic in that you can only survice about 2-3 shots from a rifle. you can zero your scopes to get perfect shots from a distance. 1st and 3rd person views allow for very tactical gameplay. you can pilot jets and helicopters, drive tanks and transport vehilces, or dominate on foot. the maps are massive allowing for very intense wide scale (or small) fire fights. the mods alone make this game worth getting. so many different game modes available to play thanks to the modding community for this game. absolutely worth every penny. if you like slower paced, tactical shooters this is your game! lone wolf or team up, both excel in this game.",97.0

"this is a fun filled game full of many game modes and what to play with friends. this is hard to learn for new comers with all the stat and controls but you can learn it over a hour or two. this is a good buy if you have friends , i have a hard time playing this game alone for lone hours but i can make so much fun out of this game. i recommed this game if you have friends buying or has it all ready. have a great day and sorry for my grammer :)))))",128.8
"really good game but frames are ing terrible! they lock at around 30 to 45 until you get into combat then they drop to anywhere from ing 5 to 15 its ridicoulus!",100.7
"arma 3 one of the best military simulator on the market right now! alot of good features,shooting out of vechicles and a very good! warning:amd performs worse than intel in this game due to it being more cpu based buy it on sale or right now!",136.6

"maybe good for mods, but campain looks . maybe not campain itself but ai. ive finished 6 missions so far and all time ive been running behind ai as they never get tired.. then you have  aim etc etc etc. also i hate super duper talks like copy that and other bla-bla. too much of non-sense in simple situations. movement is good",56.9
"the best sandbox war game of the year arma 3 is a continuation to the arma series by bohemia interactive, taken to the next level. with increased player control/movement, enhanced mechanics for vehicles, weapon systems (if you buy it), flight models (if you buy it -_-), and much more! the control in tight spaces should be worked on, this is no call of duty, the controls are clunky, but are a vast improvement over the previous installment (arma 2). another of the top complaints of this game is the netcode. it is terrible under load, but again, is much better than arma 2.",428.0
"first off, this game is amazing. it has something to suit everyone, even though it is a military simulator. this is because of a dedicated community of modders. so if you dont want to be a soldier, get on an altis life server and fish or something. if you want the fight a gladitorial battle to the death, try battle royale. if youre into zombies there breaking point or overpoch. if you want a strict pvp mode that plays similaryly to bp or overpoch, get wasteland. there is so much that this game has to offer that i couldnt begin to list it all. this game like every other is not without flaws, however unlike many games, the dedicated community of modder also takes care of that with their own patches and fixes. seems like bohemia interactive did everything right with arma 3, and the opposite with dayz standalone.",271.9

"very good game..but a little bit too heavy for a gaming pc..i have i5 4430 8gb ram & gtx770 and i cant handle it with 60fps while i am streaming..please just make a new patch for cpu cores because mine hits on 80& usage..:( i am playing on high setting without anti-allaiting on 54 fps on average..soo bad for gaming rig with 2 ssds and some good parts!",123.1
"the butt-crawling makes this game the most tactical game ever. 10/10 will crawl to victory.",465.5
"arma 3 is a great game. is it the best shooter? no. it does however have many features no other shooter offers. the ability to switch views is neat, but the real difference is gun positions. to prone, kneeling, leaning on that fence, rolling on your side, high and low ready with slung. if this game had the money of bf4 or cod it would blow them out of the water. team coms and work mixed with the pure massive size of the maps work well. the other large draw is the mods. where else can i cook meth, have a shootout, steal a helicopter, get away. then take out the herion dealers with the helicopter. lose it in the fight and be gunned down after running 2 miles trough a mountain trying to avoid a manhunt. almost anything or scenario that is avaiable irl can be set up in here. there are some downpoints like bugs and glitches, but no major ones. some nights are an effort in frustraion while trying to get geared up, then killed soon as you do. best when played with friends.",193.4
"arma extremely fun, has a lot of mod-ability, and good fun with friends with a lot of coop action. im glad i bought it as early as alpha, and has offered hours of fun. however, this game is clunky. almost furiously clunky. they take all this time to design a great concept for a game, create all the content of arma 3 and develop this game. the only problem is, they built it on an out dated and really bad engine. at times, i cannot help but ask myself why. like why cant i move while switching weapons. or why everytime i move its just delayed. even my relatively powerful computer can barely run this game with 30 frames when theres some action. dont get me wrong, its still a fun game. i really enjoy it, but its like arma 2s engine with a lot more content that it can barely handle, and its pretty easy to tell.",113.2
"great, very realistic war game. one thing id look out for is to watch your specs when playing this game because you need a fairly high-end computer to be able to run this game with good enough graphics that the game doesnt look like play-doh the graphics are wonderful, especially if youre coming from arma 2. the gameplay is good, though the controls themselves can be a bit difficult to get used to if its your first time to arma. other than that, the game is great and there is much more to do in the game than just battles as people have made zombie and roleplaying mods which can also be played online! ive played this tremendously myself and have an ongoing series for my channel, if anyone is interested in seeing the game being played firsthand then feel free to check out my series here:",546.0
"dont even own this game. 10/10 would review nothing again.",0.1
"this game and is daily updates -_- but its a good game lol.",18.6
"i wont lie, this game messed with my head when i first got it. i dont play single player or king of the hill or any of that. epoch is the way to go. start with nothing a build your way up? amazing. certianly helps to have people who know what theyre doing teach you. 9/10 (only because i always get kicked for high ping -.-)",128.3

"buy one game and thanks to the countless mods, you get several different games. best video game purchase i ever made.",325.1
"this games definetly for people who like to be imaginative in the military action category. i like the tactical mechanics but i wish theyd change the fighting style of infantry when your a group leader. that problem makes the combat a little slow. other than that i am now in love with arma in general. the gameplay is a whole lot more fun than all these brand new fpss and it really throws you into the battle and isnt just point and shoot but brings it to a whole new playing level, making it feel that much more real. i have to say what makes the games a million times better is the modding community. there is never a single day where i am bored of playing this game, other than my inexperience with scripting in the editor, making it hard to look around and find solutions to my problems. i would seriously recommend this game for someone looking to have fun, sharpen their senses, or both.",556.1
"one of the most realistic games ever. gr8 b8 m8 no h8 8/8",12.1
"better combat than arma 2. now are the guns better? yeh, attachments make them better. do they handle better? well, id argue that the damage system and how bullets flyed was better in arma 2, and that people move too fast when jogging in arma 3. but then again, people still play battle royal and koth in arma 3 so yeah, arma 3 is better.",114.2
"arma 3 is an amazing game. you can do almost anything on it. you can do a role-playing simulation, or a full out death match if you want. ive played this game a lot with my friends and we all love it.",394.5
"a whole tastatur for play...before u find the right key u dead.",8.4
"simply the best militry simulator on the market, even if you dont like that aspect you can play the famous mods like wasteland and altis life. you dont even need a mod manager for that (arma 2). its defently an improvemend to amra 2.",58.7
"arma 3 on its own is not something that unique and great but if you try some of the mods out there such as altis life youre gonna freaking love it.worth every penny.",481.5
"complex, difficult, but extremely rewarding. great campaign, lots of mods and things you can do to it. really shines when played as a group!",82.2
"if you have aspergers, or just suffer from a mild retardation, this game is perfect for you. i, no different from people who play this game probably do it with friends, which means its another one of those games you purchase using a fair amount of currency, only being able to play it once every blue moon. the graphic capability of this game, combined with all the mods and possible actions on the game, makes it a nest for all that is nerdy on games. this game makes you feel you are more than just a fat, mentally challenged, reddit reader and  poster, but sulks into the deep portion of your soul which demands more action in your life, making you feel good watching the controlled fit digitally created alpha male move around while imagining it to be a representation of yourself. would give a better score if voxel mining were implemented.",5.9
"i highly recommend this game to anyone who is tired of all the twitch shooters out there.",828.1
"arma 3 is by far the most realistic, most entertaining, and most intence war simulator of all time! if the technology is availible this game should come out for next gen. consoles. not only is this an amazing sandbox but it also blows every other war game out of the water! keep up the good work bohemia interactive, and step aside battlefield and cod because a new age has started. the age of a real war.",252.4
