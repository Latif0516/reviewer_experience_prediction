"need to rework weapon damage models, but other that that this game is amazing.",536.2
"a big step up from arma 2 game is much more optimized and the visuals are stunning. would defenitely recommend this over arma 2",55.4
"it always chrashes no matter what i play and there seems to be no fix",28.6
"this game always crashes. i dont like it. buy it now.",1.9
"this could have been a great game, the problem is the developers of the engine are stuck in the 1990s and made an engine that dont take advantage of your gpu. with an i7 2600 and gtx 780 i have between 20-30 fps, and i have that on absolutely maxed out settings as well as the lowest possible. there is only one reason to even consider this game, and its for the great mod community. but overall, this company does not deserve any of your money.",140.7
"this game is amazing. i tell all my friends about and they ask what kind of game it is and i tell them, a combat simulator. you dont go in to this game with a mini gun and kill everyone with one shot. the damage is realistic. if you shoot someone with a pistol to the head they will die. i was playing on a role playing server trying to cause a ruckas and i shot someone to the upper chest area with an assault rifle and they died. this is the game to play! massive maps. role playing, team death match modes, capture the hill modes, coop missions, seperate zombie mods (breaking point). this game should be a pc gamers bible. always on their side and preach it to others.",168.6
"arma 3 is an excellent war/army simulation game, great graphics, excellent gameplay. was really impressed. what makes arma 3 different form its predecessors is the engine. also it has a ton of fun and exciting mods like breaking point which is arma 3 dayz.",0.3
"makes cod, moh, battlefield, and every other modern-themed quasi-military game feel like rubbish. the simulation is fantastic, the realism is unmatched, and the gameplay is stunning. i was stunned by the alpha release: it was like nothing id ever played before. then the full release came around, and i was even more impressed. there are a few downsides to arma 3, dont get me wrong. the control layout learning curve is extremely steep, to run the game at maximum graphicical settings requires a very beefy set of hardware, and some of the servers suck. but, and this is a big but, if you are looking for realism, look no further. if you cant do something in the base game, i guarantee there is a mod somewhere to make it work. another plus is the community; because the learning curve coming in is so steep, it weeds out a vast majority of the 12-year-old cod crowd that we mature gamers love to hate. in closing, i highly reccomend arma 3, but be warned: it is not for the casual gamer.",71.5
"was tazed by a cop for trying to sell illegal fedoras 10/10",169.2
"space-iran sends an army of arid buzz lightyears to invade greece",44.7
"its a good game the main problem i have with it though is that i tried to play it with a controller and i had to map the controls i needed and was still unable to shoot or aim with the controller",1.8
"getting yelled at by trying to help your team reminds me of call of duty :3",11.6
"hey i was randomly global banned :( can anyone help???",59.1
"if you enjoyed arma 2 you will definitly like this one aswell. the graphics are really nice and the missions are awesome too. there are some nice mods aswell that will keep you play this game after you are done with singleplayer",103.8
"ive started playing altis life , bought some stuff and a car , and after some time i got killed by a desync.(altis players will know what i mean) 10/10 but avoid other people",263.6
"input lag on all controls makes you feel as though youre running around with a block of concrete strapped to your head. the new go karts have what feels like a 100ms delay in single player from me pressing the d or a key to the wheels actually starting to turn.",946.4
"the most played game from my library. thats says it all.",236.0
"3/10 bad framerate almost always, steep learning curve, most game modes dont play the military sim it is built for they all play the rpg cops and robbers garbage. most servers kick you for wrong version even though its the same.",4.8
"obviously, youll know what youre getting into if youve played, and had fun playing arma ii. potenetial for some really fun mutliplayer experiences, and a whole bunch of missions on the workshop to play on your own. huge map and great game mechanics.",593.7
"coming from a very extensive flight sim background, i generally expect too much from games these days. having the whole planet at your fingertips flying from city to city, country to country... high fidelity aircraft systems correctly simulated.. it sure sets a high bar! but arma 3 leaves no part of me unsatisfied, the immersion factor is brilliant and playing with the right people very professional! i definitely recommend!",159.0
"great graphics, superb realism, excellent multiplayer. all and all just a great game!",51.3
"overall great game! a few glitches and things that should be fixed but has turned out awesome!",49.6
"this is meant to a realistic simulator right? so far ive only got a huge free smulation of complete lag. done with arma 2+3, for the love of god do not make another game bohemia..youre base game sucks and the mods only suck half as bad..",89.3
"very qwirky physics but good fun for the patient shooter.",139.4
"i have to say that this is probably my favorite game of all time. im able to spend countless hours in arma iii and still have a great time doing so. there are gamemodes that everyone will enjoy and support for modding is pretty good as well. i would rate this game a 9/10 for its awesome action packed gameplay. while on mission there is hardly ever a time when im not on edge being aware that the enemy may be anywhere. whether you want to play arma iii as tatically as possible in a video game, you can. if you want to just play casually and shoot some bad guys cause its fun.... go right ahead you can do that too. i overall just love the game and play it mostly multiplayer because although the campaign is great multiplayer is where its really at!",195.2
"great game! some of the best realistic gunplay and combat. the base game is good, but its the multiplayer that shines. things like altis life and battle royale will have you hooked.",91.4
"game is awesome! takes a while to get used to, but definitly worth it!!",18.9
"so many mods to play for every type of playstyle, they really nailed it with this game. you dont see many modable games these dayz.",402.6
"this game is for those who can cope with many buttons and those who really like realistic games. the campaign its self is pretty boring but the modded multiplayer games are the thing that makes it more addicting.",378.0
"this game is just amazing, it is a game that requires a big big computer, but it looks fantastic as soon as you get the computer! i may have only killed one person, but this game is just really fun, coop, sandbox, tdm, rpg, and so on!",47.4
"this is the perfect military game and if you are into tactics and positions in a fight this is he game for you. with several thousand hours of multiplayer gameplay and dlc there is so much to do:)",26.9
"probably the best military survival simulator available, cant wait for some of the awesome looking mods to be released.",138.1
"if you are looking for a ground combat simulation, then this is definitely for you. the game features a vast range of weapons and equipment. it also come with a powerful editor, allows you to create your own missions and scenarios.",118.6
"absolutely love it! but wish it was alot! less cpu intensive. if you have a 2010 or lower pc with intel i5 or better dont even think of this game you wont beable to run it at a reasonable fps",200.9
"good but you need to try and get the game on apple!!!!",11.8
"if youre looking for a military simulator then arma 3 is your best bet. realistic gameplay. great graphics and sound effects. lots of gameplay modes available.",256.9
"better than arma 2 betttere customization and graphiics loved it",217.3
"dont believe the neckbeards saying its a military simulator. its immersive to an extent, but a mid level cod player could drop in with no problem. you see guys you shoot guys. the difference being there 500 meters away in tanks with thermal vision.",188.5
"altis life = best rp ever depending on server. great game over all!",706.7
"what more do you want? guns, tanks, helos, jets and a whole lot of hhhhhuuuuuuurrrrraaaaahhhhhhh",96.3
"animations are more responsive, some of the new things introduced are nice, everything else is terrible. for the time being this game remains unplayable for me due to performance issues, lack of content, seemingly uncaring attitudes by the developers and a portion of the fanbase, and general disinterest in the story of this particular campaign. unless by miracle i find a monster gaming rig behind my house one day and major changes are done to the game and to peoples mindsets, i doubt i will return to this game any time soon. seeing where this game seems to be headed, i doubt any major changes are coming. im quite happy with operation flashpoint and arma 2 in the meantime and for anyone looking for a good mil-sim or just a fun time with your friends, i suggest you buy one of the two aforementioned games instead of this. edit: to clarify, i meant operation flashpoint: cold war crisis, the first game of the operation flashpoint series, which i believe is now called armed assault: cold war crisis.",21.8
"runs like forest gump before he had the leg braces removed. (bad) would love to get into this game, but 20 fps with low settings on a decent pc is crazy because the game doesnt even look all that good.",2.9
"best arma series game ever :3 when it on a free weekend and yet still better but i wish to get the game when it was free but way to expensive i would recommend the game for those people who dont have it",0.1
"at first i didnt like this game, im a battlefield fan and i thought this game was buggy, stupid and just overall dumb...but then my buddies bought it and we all played and this is one of the best games ive ever played, so much to do, no limits or leveling, everything at your disposal, very tactical, entertaining and fun. i still play bf4, but this will be consuming most of my gaming time from now on. highly reccommend",14.7
"coming from a very extensive flight sim background, i generally expect too much from games these days. having the whole planet at your fingertips flying from city to city, country to country... high fidelity aircraft systems correctly simulated.. it sure sets a high bar! but arma 3 leaves no part of me unsatisfied, the immersion factor is brilliant and playing with the right people very professional! i definitely recommend!",159.0
"extremley fun, extremely low price and a great amount of content, if you liked the previous arma games then its a no-brainer, buy it!",216.0
"if you enjoy walking for 3 days to only get shot by a sniper a kilometer away. you will love arma iii.",78.4
"arma 3 is like arma 2 except throw in tons of new features and new things to bring to the table. it is still a simulator, however it has improved from its standpoint with arma 2. unlike arma 2 with it making it big with dayz arma 3 is huge around king of the hill and battle royale. this game is very enjoyable especially when you have friend fighting on the battle ground with you! i do recommend this game to everyone who wants to purchase it.",24.2
"battle royale is one of the best mods for the game. its like the hunger games, with guns. -wernher von kerman",51.9
"too much like arma 2, except arma 2 mods are way better.",10.0
"i would highly recommend this game. it is great fun, very good for simulating military battles and has a great community, which produce some amazing mods for everybody to play. there is stuff for everyone, if you enjoy quick pased action, you have king of the hill, wasteland for those who enjoy slower, more intense gameplay and even dayz has been ported across in the form of dayz breaking point, which is fantastic and everybody should try it. definately pick this game up!!",85.8
"finally a game that is not casual targetandshoot, in arma you first have to plan your mission and then 95% of the time run around. but that feeling when running to an op, taking position, knowing that you are gonna open fire soon...just awesome. as in the old armas you get a lot of online mods, but also a very complicated control system and not much for your hardware. but i mean: it still looks very well on a mid-end pc. also it is cool that vehicels are powered rightly (some a bit op, bohemsia keeps patching, so...) and that you can discover the whole huge map so, i would say definitly buy, if you are clear that this is a simulation, not just a battlefield or cod",45.8
"the most realistic shooting ive ever played. definately not an easygoing fast-paced shooter, its complicated and hard and takes time to master. the singleplayer mode is good, but dont expect a really special story and unforgettable characters. it think its plain and straitforward: you do your missions and try to stay alive while you get to enjoy some gorgeous graphics. and then theres the multiplayer mode, where most of the fun is at. the maps are great, the scenarios and objectives vary and you can stay entertained for quite some time if you end up liking the game. but its not for the fair hearted. being reckless will cost you. one shot can and will kill you so you have to think and act fast and outsmart the enemy. winning really feels like winning and losing feels like an opportunity to try harder next time. if youre looking for something fast that hands out easy rewards, you should probably get some other game as youre almost certainly going to hate this one. but if you like shooting games turned up to eleven and youre up for a challenge, youll probably enjoy arma.",2.4
"kerry: lieutenant, do you read me over? james: go ahead corporal kerry: i could really use, some help i got nothing here james: thought you yanks coulndt get enough freedom? kerry: we respect lieutenant, f*ck you! 69/10",67.3
"this was my first arma game and it was amazing the controls are not hard but not the easiest this game is probly te best game i have ever played in gameplay but..... now it crashes to the point i cant play any multiplayer but other than that its amazing i think anyone who likes shooters and roleplay games should buy and play this game at least try it sometime",588.4
"if you are looking for a realistic military sandbox, then look no further than arma 3. from a mission editor that allows the player to create any scenario possible, to an extensive list of community mods and addons, the possiblities are endless. the developers do an amazing job of fixing bugs and fueling all players with new content, and will do so for the next few years for sure! 10/10",375.2
"bought the game, got around 100 hours. then i get banned because i picked up a hacked weapon in dayz.",348.6
"one of the best game sive played this year, would definetly recommend if you dont mind the occasional bugged death.",109.5
"this game is a very well made military simulator. it is very realistic, unlike most fps games. im not discrediting call of duty or battlefield, but this game is a much more realistic experience.",5.2
"this gayme is nbroken it wont let me play witjh my firend ioern and we weer calf m call martixae a  lops",32.9
"cant reccomend this game enough. has great multiplayer. i love sandbox. its like a non-buggy dayz without buggy zombies. i havent even really tried singleplayer that much yet. you have to have a good rig to play multiplayer though. i get about 40 frames less in multiplayer than in singleplayer. you have been warned.",21.9
"one of the best shooters i have every played, much better combat than arma 2. hard to run tho. low fps in most servers. but great game. many mods that make it great.",305.0
"poor singleplayer, excellent and huge ( i mean really, really huge) multiplayer.",24.6
"arma 3 has made me hate every other fps, because in arma you have the freedom to do what ever you want. the games modding community is great, which keeps the game interesting with new maps, guns, vehicles, etc. the game is not that well optimised but it performs well enough and looks great. there is a lot of great gamemodes that get overshadowed by wasteland and altis life gamemodes. one great example is teetimes captrure the island gamemode. the zeus dlc is a great tool to make cool missions on the fly and the great thing about is that you dont need a dedicated community for it, you can just jump on a public game and have fun. arma has incredibly detailed mission editor in which you can spend tons of time just exploring the map, blowing up some ai, learning to fly a helicopter, and so on. if you like shootters and would like to play something more realistic get arma 3.",272.9
"my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game, ever. were on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. im leading a team of 4 men. we come to a crossroad and i sprint across, telling my men to hold back. i cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. nothing. i run, my saw gunner runs, my medic runs. but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across. anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through? remember the sniper scene? the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down. he then takes two more in the chest. the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. he screams as hes being shot. crawling, drenched in his own blood. sarge? you aint leaving me out here like this, right? i-i wanna go with you guys! cmon sarge, h-help me! cmon! please dont leave me! he died after that. i cried and he respawned. i would recommend getting :)",53.0
"this game is the best military simulation games, and the best multiplayer gameplay i have played so far. highly recomended",330.2
"a great game that when i went to buy the sale went off",77.6
"completely worthless game. textures dont load more that 100 feet infromt of you. controls are so unresponsive it is not worth playing. not even worth playing for free. this game missed its mark. all the nice landscapes and footage you saw in the video was cutscenes. total marketing lie",0.4
"what a dissapointment. massive step back from arma 2 and the campaign is made in the basic mission editor, i can make better missions myself. embarrasing.",45.2
"great addons like atlis life defornatly recormended",172.9
"i dont like the game its boring and the same as arma 2",112.2
"very fun game that is worth every pennny. make sure you have a good rig! it will help immensly!",146.6
"very hardcore game for anybody who likes mil sims as much as i do, although, if you are nto used to the arma series i do not reccomend it to you, there are so many controls to remeber but you can still learn them! def a 10/10 game",247.4
"my mic does not work in arma 3. i have tried everything out of everything with no results at all, plz help. my mic works in skype, voice recs, and other games like gmod. but it dosent work in arma 3. there is nothing wrong with my mic. there is only something wrong with arma 3 that dosent transmit my voice at all. plz add me on steam and help me im very desperete. and frustrated. and by the way sry for my bad english",259.6
"want a game you can play for years and have no limits to what can be done with this game? 275 hrs and counting and i still find new stuff to do all the time. only cons are as always with arma, optimization blows. but quite honestly, i probably wouldve paid $200 if thats what they charged, its that good.",296.7
"the graphics are beautiful, gameplay feels realistic and its mindblowing even while its still in alpha stage development. although the system requirements are quite high, i completely recommend this game! buy it now.",274.9
", you pay $60.00 for a game only for it to be 40% off, 3 days later!!",5.7
"the most epic movie military survival simulation i have ever played. wanna create your own action movie simulation where you decide what to do next? then this is the game for you. i only play on wasteland servers coz i find it more challenging and yes the survival is there which made it more interesting. this game is fun playing with friends. you need to have a working mic, you cant go typing in chat while in a gunfight right? :) got low frames or performance issues? i have one solution for you, upgrade your system. i just did and it worked like a charm. have a nice day.",235.7
"i got banned form all servers dont play this game its a waste of money you get banned from one server its all servers. unless i get unbanned i hate this game.",139.8
"buy one game and thanks to the countless mods, you get several different games. best video game purchase i ever made.",325.1
"great game, stunning graphics, and zombies....yes....zombies",42.2
"this game is absolutely amazing. it can be whatever you want it to be deliver any experience you are looking for. whether that be hardcore realism like no other game imaginable, shooting with your friends and driving karts, simply taking in the beauty, and everything inbetween, this game can provide it. it may be slow paced at times, but this allows for a scale beyond all others. in no other game can i say that i had a good time in a mission, but also have used my compass more than my trigger.",2.3
"this game is hours of endless possibilities if you put in what you want to get out. best shooter of my lifetime.",190.0
"this is the definitive shooter. forget call of duty, forget battlefield, this is leagues beyond those titles. from fighting as a lone wolf to supporting a team of seventy-two other players on land, above or below seas, and in the sky, everything feels just as it should, just as it would be if it were real. for those that love beutiful visuals, sharp skill curves, and of course, bohemias trademark realism, this title cannot be missed.",598.0
"fun, tactical interesting war simulator. variety of online/singleplay gameplay!",800.2
"played battle royale, plane went straight in the ground 11/10",181.6
"steal team members heli, get shouted at, crash 10/10 ign- 1642bc",123.5
"i like it because there is a lot of modes for it. but i do not like the stama it wares out to soon",815.9
"great war based sandbox. lots of mods to keep everything from getting stale.",143.9
"recommend it because its a good game, very good fps game, big variety of mods, some bugs (bohemia interactive likes to create games with more bugs than normal, dayz is an example) but overall worth the money.",4.7
"this game can offer you a lot of new experience and probably teach you some patience aswell. yet i cant tell if you have to buy it or not, you must decide what you want and does this game have it. apart from that it offers you a lot of sp missions - campaign and player made missions aswell as mp which is incredibly awesome. thumbs up for their project and good luck in development of this. for players who dont have it - well .. you must know that there are bugs and issues in game, but that is not ruining gameplay in any way. (at least i havent come up on such). if you have bought it, dont be shy and explore what it offers, this game is not meant to be bought and after failed mp (get killed) or sp (killed again) thrown out. believe me it have much to offer! :)",81.9
"its a great game, its just a very computer demanding game. the only problems i had with this is the dsync problems which can cause some confusion. its a great game to play with friends and get a squad together. i got this on the steam summer sale for $30 so i think it was money well spent. obligatory: dove underwater, and got into a firefight with scuba divers. 5/5",168.6
"omg have 355.9 hrs on record and this game never gets old playing with friends worth every penny just one thing if you do buy, buy the bundle containing all dlcs because otherwise will cost you alot in future if you want them",341.1
"controls are bad. glitchy. dont waste youre money.",2.8
"ran over a hill. got shot by a tank. got called a noob. 10/10 would noob again",0.5
"good game recomend it to people like my self and others who like virtul reality game,fighting,action and rpg love it great job bohemiea thanks again good job",53.3
"i love it i love itttttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oom soooo good",47.6
"we had a argument on who should be squad lead, we then proceded to teamkill each other until one of us gave up. then the gamemaster lost it and spawned in 100 diving teams (on land) to murder us all. then a entire batalion of tank squads, and 100 paratroopers above us to top it all off. 9/11, a true military experince. -a graduated navy seal",76.9
"i was talking to a guy in a courtyard and a tank out of nowhere squished him. so i stole his gear, then a guy came over a started shouting ahahahahahhahahahhhhhhhhhahahah with unusual music in the background while placing a satchel charge on the floor nearby and set it to 1 second, he then said fly me too the moon. ive always wondered if he fulfilled his dream of space flight.",39.4
"arma 3 is so good i dont have time to fully review it i just want to get back to playing.",109.1
"i loved arma2, sepnding endless hours building missions, and adding 3rd party content. initially arma3 was the same, although it could be a bit laggy.... and then out of the blue, the audio became very broken, stuttery and utterly disjointed, and the game itself started running at 7-9 fps, whilst complaining that bacause it was modded (its not) and that i may encounter problems (i am). ive uninstalled and re-installed, and can see zero improvement - despite all settings now put to low. sorry guys, not good enough. it makes me question the value of steam, as arma2 never had any such issues, and with steam, i no longer feel in control of whats going on, and what is, or had been, loaded. very unhappy.",37.4
"best fps game ive played in awhile. fan of the realism and roleplay including the moded servers which make it way better. playing with a group or alone you will enjoy this game. give this game a 9/10 ; optimization is very good , downfall is the high pinged servers.",100.0
"well, i like the game and the thinking of it, but in my opinion its still to glitchy to buy. not to mention they have alot of optimizing left, im running a rly strong computer but only gets like 20-30fps on low settings. and this doesnt just concern me so, but many many others. other then that, i think this game can be rly good once they fix the bugs and the optimizing of it, then i would love it. so all in all - its to early to buy it.",177.6
"its one of the most accurate action/mil-sim game ive ever played. there is nothing else like this out there. 10/10",119.7
"your next-gen military simulator is here, and its better than ever before.",48.2
"arma 3 is a great open world simulation military shooter. its not like your normal run and gun shooter. the game focus more on the realistic side where tactics and team work is key on being successful. arma 3 give you a large variety and options, kind of like battlefield 4. youre able to be just a random grunt or you can fly a helicopter (not as easy as other games) or drive a tank. bohemia interactive did a great job on the graphics of the game as well, it can be hard to find camouflaged players that are not moving unless you have thermal optics or what not. i recommend this game to more of the hardcore gamers who looks for a realistic game. i dont recommend it if your just trying to find a shooter to pop in and out like counter-strike.",627.7
"for the money... well no.. this game is worth 10 times less than what i paid for it. actually i have played phone games more exciting than this. my review for arma 3 is simple, i got it on steam sale, i played it 3 times. and its been pretty bad. - the servers cause fps lag (because i get 40fps normally on some servers and others it crawls to 9) - the missions are basically to try and troll people - the maps are big and awesome but theres not many people and whoever you see just kills you - its just boring half the time. so if you like just exploring the virtual map and doing jack all half the time then this games for you. but you could be doing that in the real world and have an extra $30 bucks in your wallet (sale price). decisions decisions..",6.0
"terrible game, developers highly ignored optimizing and fixing bugs in the game. almost unplayable on multiplayer because of the lack of hit detection, sky rocketing desync, and minimal power usage resulting in less than 20 fps at times. keep in mind i have a $1200 rig. now for the good: the concept and basic features of the game are wonderful. if the developers worked out the kinks involved with the networking/performance aspect of the game it would be a five star game. that is the only reason i do not recommend it. fix the bugs and its a wonderful game. as of right now it is unplayable.",67.7
"this game is probably the least fun game ive played in a long time. it tries to sell itself as a military sim, but its as much a military sim as minecraft. wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. also, 60 dollar price tag? games like red orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. youre money is better spent elsewhere.",7.8
"this game sucks... straight up....worst $60 game i have ever bought in my life... its boring...and the controls are stupid as ****",8.6
"its ing amazing! really fun to play, but has a bit of a learning curve. can be hard tp play at time for people new to the arma series. this game is a must buy for anyone who likes fps games.",922.4
"arma 3 is great with friends and also when your board you can mhave fun with other people.",0.7
"this game is kinda scary because theres night time, and everything is dark. i am really scared of the night but wait! theres also support for realtime lights and night vision so night isnt really a issue anymore. while there are cool lights in this game, it offers a vast array of other features, such as: warfare war weapons war cars war planes war people war simulations war war horse war running realtime marching band i could continue listing other war features for hours on end, but i will stop here. the rest is for you to discover, since that is the essence of this game, discovery and exploration. that and shooting guns.",117.6
"arma 3 is the most pure pc game in the world. 10/10",73.4
"( ( battlefield 4 + skyrim + cs go + terrbile menu and controls ) * (hatred of frame rates + all around frustration) ) ^ awkwardness = if you think plaing arma is manly i am sincerely worried.",3.3
"this is ridiculous i payed $66 for a game that is so incredibly poorly optimized that i only get 30 fps in most places. i have a really good computer too so this is extremely frusterating! bohemia why can you never make any games that are well optimized. if youre worried your pc cant handle this game, well sorry to break it to you but theres a 70% chance it wont run it very well. i want my money back! they should make a demo to see if you can run the game for future buyers so they dont make the mistake i did....",13.0
"awesome game. great simulation progress, and great for people who have an imagination and like to great their own modifications and missions.",852.2
"very realistic and even my old pc from 2006 can run this! :) 10/10",120.1
"i dont even have the game but its allowing me to write this. i win.",0.9
"this game has so much to do and is a realistic and very intense simluator. i love it!",25.7
"the best shooter youll ever play trust me. plus ill play with you!",103.4
"went on the breaking point mod, (dayz) and i was instantly hunted down by 6 men in a chopper. i ran to the first house i saw picked up an axe and axed the first man to come in. i then proceeded to grab his gun off him but was shot in the head. they then proceeded to say the only reason this is happening is because i had a brown player model. 10/10 would brown player model again.",76.9

"first off, this game is amazing. it has something to suit everyone, even though it is a military simulator. this is because of a dedicated community of modders. so if you dont want to be a soldier, get on an altis life server and fish or something. if you want the fight a gladitorial battle to the death, try battle royale. if youre into zombies there breaking point or overpoch. if you want a strict pvp mode that plays similaryly to bp or overpoch, get wasteland. there is so much that this game has to offer that i couldnt begin to list it all. this game like every other is not without flaws, however unlike many games, the dedicated community of modder also takes care of that with their own patches and fixes. seems like bohemia interactive did everything right with arma 3, and the opposite with dayz standalone.",271.9

"some say arma iii is too hardcore, some claim it to be #1 bug simulator, but nevertheless its the most well-made, most realistic warfare simulator. 1. controls there is little difference between the controlls of arma ii and its precessor. however, some changes were made, like controlling your characters position with ctrl.+w/s. it is often mentioned that the game is too hard to play due to its controls, but what else can be done? its a simulator, not an ordinary fps. 2. graphics the visual part of arma iii is also state-of-the-art. various effects like pip (picture in picture), shadows regulation, textures quality will leave you pleased. 3. difficulty level the difficulty is the thing that scares most newbies. its not like cod/bf/moh!, they shout. and they are right. yes, its hader than most fps, but after a week or two you will be playing it like a pro! conclusion arma iii may not be action-driven, it may have some bugs, but its the most realistic war experience youll ever get without the need of going to the army.",9.1

"this is an infantry simulator. i have found nothing else that comes close to it. there are aircraft, seacraft, vehicles, and armor, but those are mostly there to support the infantry. so dont expect a flight simulator. this game focuses on fireteam and squad tactics, and to a very small degree, if you want to take it that far, strategy. there are times when you might play as a lone wolf, but as an infantryman you are just another cog in the machine, another pawn on the chessboard. you might not make it very far by yourself. especially if youre just running ahead based on luck, instead of using sound strategy and tactics.",843.5

"easily the best, most polished installment of bis arma series. ive been playing bi games since 2001s operation: flashpoint. its amazing to see how the same engine (real virtuality) has evolved over the years, errrr decades actually, wow its been a while - now i feel old. so, in summary, arma 3 is a complex and realistic simulator that allows players to realize the rapidly impending date of their last breath, to know that every second that ticks by their billions of cells die just a little bit more, their neurons demyelinating, and their arteries incrementally hardening. its a firm unyielding grip that death has upon us, he authoritatively clutches the keys to the universe in one bony claw and simultaneously our hearts and souls in the cold phalanges of the other. thank you arma 3 for revealing the terrifying reality of my mortal existence. in death we are infinitely alone, no one to hear our trembling wimpers as we rock back and forth in the dark corner of an unending void of pure, sterile, black nothingness that warps us further into catatonia. score: 10/10",351.3

"as an old ofp-veteran i never managed to get familiar with the sequels (arma, arma ii), though i bought them all and tried to play. the old fascination never happend to catch me again because of lack of story and broken gameplay (im not too enthusiastic about multiplayer...) i was sceptic about arma3, since it was pushed a lot via different magazines and channels. at first glimpse i seemed to be right, arma 3 without singleplayer, wtf? but: i have to admit, that the two chapters of the campaign yet released brought it all back for me. the old fever came back in a rush, nailing me in my seat just to replay mission by mission over and over again (you know, just to not lose a single member of my team...). gameplay is smooth, i never came across (or failed to recognize) a single bug, graphics are awesome, weapon handling is unmatched ... i could carry on like that for while. to make a long story short: you liked ofp, you are very probably going to like this one too, even if you couldnt get friendly with arma or arma2.",185.7

"the only problem with arma 3 is... the lack of content. the arma 2 had such a great community and mods and even the game had more guns and armor at the start than arma 3. i just cant understand why devs did not put in stuff like bipods, advanced first aid, helicopter features, portable mgs, and on and on, that arma 2 had. so if you buy arma 3 you get a bit more polished arma, but with the lack of good multiplayer servers and simplicity in game experience. so if you are new to the arma 3 its fine you wont even know what im talking about and go ahead its a great game. but if you were a fan of arma 2 like me, you will just be dissapointed, about the multiplayer content and community pick. and bohemia interactive seems to like ea principles of marketing game. its hilarious that they are trowing out dlcs that enable you so basic thing as a rope hook on a helicopter for 15$! which it should have already be in the game?! so the final tought is still, a good game but the devs ed it up big time. 6.5/10 so wake up bohemia and stop being so lazy and dull to the fan base. and if you have to rip people off with dlcs put at least a fair price of 5$ instead of 15$.",220.5

"despite many warnings from the community, bohemia decided to do the right thing and shove their thumb up their butts and not work off of a decent engine, again. thus resulting in 90 fps in single player, down to 10 - 15 in multiplayer, servers cant even handle all the scripts that their idiotic owners apply to said server, resulting in massive jam to be applied on your end of the game. instead of fixing the ai, glitches and trying to optimize the game, bohemia has decided to pump out new content that adds to the previous issues stated above. whats that? you want single player? oh well youll have to wait for them to finish pumping out those sp episodes, why yes they are free, as they should be, as you have just paid for a $60 dollar alpha. oh and the only thing people play in this realistic army sim is a god damn rpg average civi game type where you role play your actual boring life.",118.3

"i cant complain, this game delivers on what i was exspecting. i have all other games in the arma series aside from a small few of the arma 2 expansions. i love the ballistics, you get a more realistic feel for how a real firearm operates. there is much more to take into account than your simple fps. the series is great and worth a try, the controls can be intimidating but they are managable if you invest some time in training and getting a feel for it. this is a simulator so things are gonna be alot tougher than your typical war game. the ai friendly ai could use some more fine tuning and tweaking, i have had to put a few bullets into a couple insubordinate ai team mates for laying fire on targets a 1000 meters away thus helping bring more aid and attention to the base we were originally assaulting. the game is not without its bugs, and it is also a heavy on your processor much like arma 2 was but indeed it is definatly a step up in graphics. it could use a larger armory, but there is a great mod cummunity that works on things like that to help the process along. cant wait to get my saitek x55 rhino pro h.o.t.a.s. to be able to enjoy the helicopters alot more.",173.4

"this game is a military simulation game, it will put into perspective a better way the militay (especially the front line infantry and spec. ops. soldiers) work and gives you a more realistic world to play on. everything about this game is about being tacticle and smart not just rush and shoot like call of duty game or even battlefield game do. the campains are long and more difficult especially considering you dont get superman health. if you get shot 2-3 times or sometimes even once, then you are dead. explosives are more realistic in thier lethality and distance of effectiveness. you can customize your weapons and character on the go also, by simply picking stuff up off of the people that have been killed (if youre into that sort of thing [i just replenish ammo if i can get it]). the multiplayer is also completely different from other fps multiplayers, it is an experience that you just have to try, and the graphics are amazing! rating: 10 out of 10",22.0
"this game is very fun and open and alot of things to do. the singleplayer is very amazing with the stunning graphics and visuals. the audio is somewhat clear, but i can understand people clearly in chat and i can hear gunshots and explosions from a long distances and it is very cool. the multiplayer side is amazing and playing from the combat simulation with others to the altis life rpg addon and to the epic zombie survival mod of dayz to surviving and fighting in the world of wasteland. last but not least, the editor for arma 3 is very good, but very advanced to understand right away, just get used to the basic things of editing until you can create large scale battles with the editor. this game is not for the regular fps players, this game is way more intense in my opinion than call of duty or battlefield. you actually have to plan and use tactics to get the job done and the maps are very large and you cant run forever. so at first it might be irritating for new players, but you will get used to it. very fun military simulator and it is very addicting. this game is a thumbs up! :d 12/10",192.8

"i bought this game with the hopes that it would be an awesome realistic war simulator, it didnt go the way i thought. i wish that steam could let reviewers to choose a neutral option instead of thumbs or down. arma 3 is a really nice game, but also a bloody glitchy one. the game is quite enjoyable so far, but it requires lots of updates to make it even more enjoyable. to give an example of this is that some of the physics in this game are completely illogical! an example is a sports vehicle, you touch a single rock or tree on the road you can say goodbye to your wheels or hull, because the car seems to be made of paper, but when someone shoots your car, it takes like 3 clips to explode it. there are many glitches in this game that destroys the fun i have at some points, and i really hope they fix that soon. in other words, if you intend to buy arma 3, i recommend you to take it with a grain of salt, it would be better if you bought it in a discount.",69.6

"best milsim ever, but be in mind to put mods in to make the game even more realistic to sounds more guns etc. i highly recommend this game for players who like real sim-tactical shooters. with mp the game is even more fun. this game is also a fps-shooter. i recommend to buy this game when on sayle, because the price is way to high. greetings,",98.0
"i have had over 200 hours and i can say i loved every second of it. the gameplay may not be fast but my computer ran it brilliantly and the graphics do not lack personally i enjoyed the life mods and role-playing but there are many more modes to play. so yeah well worth a buy.",214.8
"step 1: buy the game after making sure i meet all requirements. step 2: install the game. step 3: click play. step 4: get arma iii has stopped working error. step 5: try running as administrator. step 6: get this aplication has failed to start because d3d11.dll was not found error. step 7: look for directx folder in the arma 3 folder, as that is a file related to it. step 8: find there is no directx folder in the arma 3 local files. step 9: re-install. step 10: get same error. 0/10 - a salty person",0.4
"i have put a few hundred hours into arma 3 and its the wackiest military game ive ever played. here are a list of entertaining things you can do in arma 3 that i have also personally partaken in: you can set up enemy faction sentry guns to kill you and your team mates- you can tactically scoot on your butt to the combat zone- you can gather your friends inside a bullet proof room and bounce bullets off the walls and watch to see who dies first- you can have your friends get in a truck then proceed to airlift said truck with a helicopter and swing them around below you while seeing how long it takes before you accidentally swing them into your main rotor and crash in an explosive inferno- you can hide in a building while your squade mate crashes heavily armed uavs into said building trying to kill you- you can hop into a vehicle just to have it explode immediately after and kill you- you can get stranded in the water after your helicopter pilot accidentally sank the chopper in the ocean, then find a civilian driving a boat and kill said civilian to where the boat is just driving itself in circles just to have it smack you in the head so youre unconsious and drown- hands down arma 3 is one of the most entertaining wacky military simulator sandbox video games ive ever played. 10/10",537.2

"cant go wrong with a sandbox. if you dont like a game mode go find another. if i was giving it stars something around a 4.5 only because graphics could be better, controller support could be better, and personally i think the game has a hell of a learning curve from a standard shooter. took a few minutes to get used to everything. there has to be a way for the cod bf type to move over. if you did that arma would have control over the pc shooter market. however come on 4.6 these days is pretty darn good. worth every penny.",456.8
"a pretty hard simulator to master for someone who is new to the series. it does, however, have an impressive world to explore and battle through but the game suffers from proper teaching (as it is multiplayer-based) so it is quite confusing for me and it has really dissapointing frame-rate performances; even if your rig is overkill. a tough game to recommend but it would be much more enjoyable if the game runs better and is more understandable. + immersive world + good teamwork + very enjoyable if understand - poor performance - somewhat hard to play, which links to low framerates a mixed thumbs up",16.6

"this game shouldnt have been released yet. deadlines kill games. i love this franchise but this game is a big, steaming, pile of poop. i dont recommend it as of now....this game isnt worth 10 bucks and they are still trying to scam people out of their 60 bucks! for 60 bucks i want a perfect game in the aspect of no bugs. this game is full of them. it seems every update that comes out makes the game worse, not better. the devs care about the money not the game. the same bugs are there since the alpha release... save your money on this pile of garbage.",2.0

"tried it for the free weekend --1 hour to down load... 15 min. of playing and uninstalling. --from what i could see, the graphics looked really nice across my triple setup and 5760x1080 was natievly supported, so that is good. too bad i had to uninstall it so fast and couldnt see more, --i hate being told on free weekend, after i bothered downloading, that you cant finish the game, you need to buy it. i wish they would tell me that first. --i could not zoom on the the equipped 10x zoom scope. just fired blind at the 400m target in training until i hit it. x-box 360 controller use could be better. --the language was terrible. after the last f-bomb, which was still in just the training part, i had enough and am uninstalling. i know i have it before; well that just adds to the realism, that is how people talk. well i am people, and i was also in the military, and that is not how i talk, if you cant find more creative ways to expresive yourself than constantly using expletives, it just shows your lack of maturity and brains. this may very well be the best military game you play and you love it dearly, but it is deinately not for me.",0.9

"this game is just awesome. ppl may complain its too expensive, but they are rly wrong. for what an arma game have and for what the community build for the game its a pretty cheap price you are paying. expect to have hundreds of hours of gameplay, because you wont master all the skills necessary to enjoy the full content of the game in just 10 hours. this game is not for casual players.",455.2
"great game. i bought this after playing dayz standalone and having never played the dayz mod or arma 2. the most realistic combat game i ever played. a must have. 9/10",215.1
"arma 3 is the most detailed combat simulator you can find for a pc . theres much improvement from arma 2 , including smarter ui, more natural feeling movement and so on. community support is excellent, with mods and scenarios created by the day, keeping the game fresh for a long time. a must buy if you are looking for a more serious shooter than your average counter-strike.",113.2
"i would not say this game is worth buying at full price, but i can tell you that its really fun nonetheless. there are a lot of bugs and it feels more like a retextured and updated arma 2 but there are plenty of fun scenarios and multiplayer is very good. the game requires a really beefy computer to not run on  graphics so if you have a crappy computer and you dont want to see  graphics, then dont get this game. however, if youre up for an intense milsim, then get this game. rate: 8/10",19.9
"ultimate boredom simulator mixed with dates 90s interface. even a custom multiplayer game gives you extremely limited options with little to no context. while the performance has been improved, just navigating the menu to play a simple multiplayer game comes with its own learning curve (opening a port to play..wtf..am i in 2005?).",1.2
"it must be said again and again: the arma series is not compareable to any cinematic driven, action packed shooters! and if you dont like teambased multiplayer, you wont get too much fun out of it, since the singleplayer campaign seems to be more like an extra. this said, the third armed assault gives you everything you need for the most realistic and intense battle experience possible! you might complain about the near future setting, which made it even harder for me to leave my beloved chernarus (arma 2) behind, but you wont stumble over pulse rifles et cetera. furthermore youll get a huge sandbox world, an editor to do in it whatever you want and a fine community that never sleeps! so, what else should i recommend right now? buy it! dont wait for more content and lower pricing, the war has already begun! edit: best game ever! =)",771.5
"okay this game needs to fix its . now i dont remeber it being this badly before. im attempting to ing re-play through the campaign and i cannot get anywhere. they have a fatigue system to where if you run you get exhausted, cannot run, shoot, ect. now. thats good. i like it. but. they need to fix it immensely. first time. cant aim. i lay down for 3 minutes to let him breath. didnt work. got shot at and killed cause i couldnt shoot back. this same senario happened over and over again. finally i got sick of it and threw all of my gear on the ground. had to be my weight right? nope. it still got me extreamly tired immediately. now. i wasnt injured (had medpacks on me. 2) i wasnt running up a hill i was walking. casually. and if it considered the clearing i was in. then well. a bug this game needs to be fixed. i was on the same part for the past two hours. until i see this fixed. no. i dont reccommend this game. at all. i never had this trouble before. they broke something. again",7.2

"for the small amount of time that i have played this game i have found it to be extremely boring and monotonous. you might think that it would be fun with zombies or karts or other stuff but no, its not. if you want to play a moddable game might as well play garrys mod, which is much much cheaper. the game is full of bugs and the controls are all backwards. half the time i find myself looking at settings when im actually trying to open a door. overall this game sucks and i reccomend that everyone steer clear from it. i also forgot to mention that it is poorly optimised. 9/10 if you want realistic 0/10 if you want fun",7.6

"this game is an total masterpiece, its the closest you can ever get with trying to remake a millitary simulation game. i say buy it!, you wont get dissapointed. and you even have tons of awesome mods, like a dayz: arma 3 mod (epoch) , which looks and plays even better than dayz standalone, itself, you have base building mechanics, tons of weapons, and best of all , you can play on player made maps, and dont make me even start talking about arma 3 battle royale. yeah and btw, the game runs much better on intel cpus than on amd cpus especially in mulitplayer.",10.9

"the most impotant thing i can say about arma, you will never see something like in any other game. you may some wonderful strategic games, awesome first person shooters with 99% of epic scenes and 1% of shooting, flight simulators and games about tanks only, but you will never see all this stuff in one place, of course, if you still dont have arma iii. allright, some fans can even remember the first part - cold war assault, but... well it looks like that, but has unique graphics, physics, new vehicles and story. but, however, arma iii is a technically great game, but the most important thing in it will always be the gameplay with all its unique fetures. so, hell yes, i recommed this game to everyone, who wants to see the real combat and wants to find him or herself in a new military world for next eternity. goodbye, ladies and jentlemen, i am going to play arma. p.s.: pardon my russian :p",27.3

"brilliant just brilliant , this game has drugs . lsd , weed , meth has it all , you may also meet funny odd people and you have so much fun . the graphics are beautiful , when you scuba dive you can see the details on the turtles and etc , being a rebel is amazing , you get rpgs , snipers , awesome military gear , and military vehicles yet i do not know how cops and medics work im sure its fun and you get more money . i extreamly reccomend to most who love military type of games ! enjoy (:",47.6
"arma 3 is a very special game. the realism that is blended with the game really brings the game to life. the maps in the game are extremely huge, allowing for people to roam and have great battles. the gamemodes associated with arma 3 show what fun can be had. battle royale is among my favorites, where the game is a hunger-games-like survival competition. there is a variety of vehicles, including aerial and sea. the weapons have many attachments, and some have the unique trait to have tracers. overall, the game is a thrilling experience. 9/10",13.7
"perfect short-distance graphics effect & nice weapon mods,but distant view seems a little simple... prety much tactical options for players and much funny veichles , particularly the helicopters,and the karts! ahahaha somehow the multiplayers mode its hard 2 connect for that evry server needs sm  addons . and  cns internet,which makes hi ping.",98.7

"very good team based shooter, tactics will be your key to winning in this game, one warning though multiplayer in this game on pub servers are super broken, find a batallion and this will be one of the best tactic games you will ever play, its also not very optimized you will play with your settings manually because optimization doesnt work",60.9

"amazing game it is very realistic and very awesome i recommend it",584.6
"about the singleplayer , it comes as a combat simulation mainly simulating various combat situations. now the game is more about the multiplayer. the multiplayer can be scripted which means you can have every mod you want. there are roleplay mods , king of the hill , deathmatch and so on. i would clearly recommend buying the game.",2.2

"7/10 - an evolution from previous installments. nice graphics and solid simulation. great squad placed multiplayer over a massive 400km sandbox. lack of content hurts its score although more is being released and developed. more campaign missions coming this december. pros: nice graphics, solid shooter simulation mechanics. more accessable compared to other titles but looses none of its depth. great combined arms mp. cons: lack of content, only a partial campaign. no training missions and still plenty of bugs remains.",25.4
"this game is very good if you enjoy hardcore action. no other shooter will get your heart racing like this game! you feel like you are in the battle, because it is so real! this game is not friendly to newbs or people who arnt used to pc games. it is also not friendly to people who dont have patience. the action in this game is fantastic, yet hard to play. it is still in alpha, but it has alot of potential. it is a simulator, so dont go jumping in thinking its your adverage shooter. this is my favorite shooter of all time right next to bioshock infinite. if you are looking for hardcore, real world wars alongside your friends, than this is perfect for you! <3",162.1

"although i have only played for like 45 hours, i would say that this is a realy well made game with very high detail of graphics and realism in this game.its he point of this game to be a military simulator, unlike your average fps games, in this game, 1 shot in the chest is enough o severely injure you/kill you.so if you are here just ing about how easy you die and how not-sturdy is the tanks built, you should probably run back to your mom and play the battlefield and the cod series. on the other hand, if you are a hardcore military simulations guy like me, you will enjoy this game. most of this games weapons and vehicles are derived from real life tanks,firearms,aircraft and helicopters,but with a more futuristicfeel to it. like radar-deflecting stealth angles and a difference on the paint schemes. generally a great game and definetely recommend for hardcore military lovers. warning:need high powered pc to run. 10/10-ign the laggg...",273.6

(idk if thats possible but it sounds cool) (ok it was just my key running over my keyboard) my helicopter was about to crash. i used an emergency exit. i flew out of the heli. landed infront of 4 guys. we became friends. then i shot at them. because i wanted their stuff. this was a bad idea. the shot back. then after 5 minutes of firefight. my friend joined. he came in a jet. he shot them down. i got their loot. me and my friend had a party. we shot guns. this was a bad idea. the 4 guys found us. they were not happy. they shot my friend. i shot their friend. (r.i.p steve) they threw a grenade at me. i died. i joined another server. i found a guy. i shot him. he survived. he killed me. i died. 11/10 friendly badguys. this took 10 minutes. i think. its christmas in 3 days. im happy. oh i just realised i wrote key instead of cat. oops. i hope ill get a new computer for christmas. i want to run this game on max settings. potato",15.2

"a much more refined experience than arma 2, whilst it may have lost some of the charm of the eastern european setting, altis is a frankly astounding technical feat in terms of detail. the episodic campaign may make the price tag seem a little steep, but there is so much more to this game than the singleplayer, the excellent multiplayer and dedicated modding community make this a game that you will continue to play for months or even years after release.",46.1

"quite a good game to play, the previous armas were good. this game has it glitches but overall it is quite a good game. a lot of game modes are in the game such as altis life or king of the hill. it makes it worth while to buy the game because you can put so many hours in it. the only thing i dont recommend is trying to get into a go-kart if you dont have the go-kart dlc bacause it will pop up continually to try to make you buy it and it is extremely annoying. it will interfer with whatever such thing you are doing. but, overall this is a good game to play and it will make your time worthwhile.",270.7
"arma 3 is an excellent game for 2 reasons. number one, its engaging and immersive and fun, and number two is the fact that bohemia interactive cares about its modding community (hence the competition make arma, not war). but arma 3 comes with a few flaws. chief among these, in my opinion, is optimization as i own a very good mid-level pc and i seem to be getting around 16 to 20fps. also is the lack of vehicles and weaponry, although i know that is set to change, i would have liked the game to be complete and not an about to finish up beta. but if you have some friends that are interested, then why dont you visit the islands of altis and stratis. live a new life in altis or stratis life, fight for survival in wasteland, or work together to defeat opfor ai in invade and annex. just bare in mind that this is a military simulator, so no run and gun or rendezooks here, just good ol fashioned tactical warfare.",436.7

"if you are a fan of games that involve warfare, and fps, i strongly reccomend this game. ill assume that youre not an arma veteran, becuase if you are, you dont need to read reviews to know this is a good gam.. simulator. war simulator. good and bad side: it is very hard to learn (its good because its a simulator not a game, and war is not easy, as cod would suggest. and its bad because youre going to die a lot) good side: it is higly entertaining and challenging, the developers worried about things like fatigue and shooting stances and its effects on accuracy. bad side: tutorials could be better, squad commanding engine is clunky at best, your units will present the bug where they no longer move wuite often, forcing you to continue alone against what you fight with a squad, or loading the game to its last saved point... what can really piss you off. but the goos outweight the bad. 8.0/10",44.0
"this game is overpriced for the content as compared to arma ii and expect to download mods to get the most out of this game. some problems still exist that were present in alpha. expect to pay for dlc (helicopters) that quite honestly i was expecting to be part of the game. with all the issues it is still pretty realistic and fun to play with friends; however i feel guilty having convinced them to buy the game after its initial release.",152.7

"awesome game, graphics, plot, multiplayer, player interaction, rpg, first person shooter... the only hitch that i got with this game is if you turn the enemy skill all the way down and your friendly skill all the way up, it still takes about 5 shots to the head to kill the enemy. i highly recommend the game. its fun to play with friends and build your own base(s). fly helicopters, drive tanks, airplanes, blow stuff up, you name it!",214.6
"it was severely rushed, put into beta when it should have been alpha and even after release i cant say it would even be called a beta. still the game is being constantly updated but it was released as full without a campaign, its being currently worked on and added to every few months. glitches and not what i expect from arma in its gameplay, despite being in the future i do prefer the previous version more. although with it being consistantly updated and steam workshop is full of user made content giving you more options with the games current state.",271.6

"as an army game its lacking, as a game with untold potential its fantastic. this isnt just an army game. when you buy this game you buy a sandbox with unlimited user created content along with endless possibilities. in my opinion this game is worth the money. i havent even scratched the surface of this game and im already hooked.",5.3
"love this game... good action and pvp... base building is nice... only downside id say is the early bugs.... and if you dont find a vehicle... you run.... if you can make it past them 2 downers this game is number 1... like battlefield and rust mixed... absolute love",781.5
"the game by itself isnt that fantastic. the graphics and gameplay are good, but it isnt worth the price. using the breaking point mod adds a whole new depth into the game and i would strongly recommend downloading it if you have the arma iii game. overall i recommend it because i havent regretted buying it for $60 and therefore hope you feel the same if you buy it. (best to buy it on special though)",18.3
"this game is very good, but it is hard if you dont have a laptop that can make high graphics. this game look very real. so if you want a game that is like to be in war in the realy world then this game is something for you. i have not have the chance of having the highest but i love how they make this game so real. it is so many things that can happen in this game. it is not like the other shooting games, on this game you have to have a plan all the time. it is many viechles on this game like battleship, jeep, helicopter, tanks, boat and much more. if you have a fast laptop this game is woth it.",17.2

"simply amazing. the games feels a lot smoother than arma 2.",78.7
"arma 3, contrary to popular belief, is a very good game. it really just depends on who you are, or who you play with. if you spend your entire time playing arma 3 hoping to have an experience similar to dayz, you wont have much fun. what you really need to do is join servers that are running gamemodes such as domination, and coordinate with your entire team. keep in mind that arma 3 is nothing like battlefield or call of duty because you have to pay attention to the global picture of the entire map rather than just what you are currently aiming at. you have to talk to your squad, even if it is people you dont even know very well, because everyone contributes to the well being of the squad. all in all, arma 3 is an extremely fun game as long as you play it correctly.",295.8
"alpha is . the terrain detai is seriously lacking. shadow and lightening effects seem not to be working properly. and the most important thing is the performance is horrible! with 660ti, i am only getting 35+ fps putting on medium quality. definitely looking forward to beta and full game. but alpha is just .",42.5
"really good game. if youve played arma 2 then this is very similar, if you dont like arma 2 then you wont like this either. pretty much a complete upgrade from arma 2 with graphics ect. its hard to explaine what this game is and if you will like it. i just recommend you go watch a few videos on it.",6.8
"this game has no problems at all! i got 99 problems but a glitch aint one!",312.8
"pretty much the best game ive ever played. looks like youre playing in a picture, and tactics is a really big part. gets a 100x more fun with some mates. a lot of different gamemodes, and oh the possibilities with all the different mods! now you can also fire from choppers and ground vehicles with the new update. so gather some friends, buy the game, hop on a server, and get some simply epic experiences.",815.8

"first off, let me say that arma 3 is a pretty amazing game with a great community... if you can run it smoothly. i run a pretty nice rig with a gtx 770 (wayyyy above the recommended) and get around 40-55 fps on ultra in singleplayer, but somehow run 20-25 max fps in multiplayer. this fps occurs on all the settings in multiplayer, including low. if bohemia fixed the fps problem id gladly tell them shut up and take my money please help us help you!",4.1

"arma 3 is like arma 2 except throw in tons of new features and new things to bring to the table. it is still a simulator, however it has improved from its standpoint with arma 2. unlike arma 2 with it making it big with dayz arma 3 is huge around king of the hill and battle royale. this game is very enjoyable especially when you have friend fighting on the battle ground with you! i do recommend this game to everyone who wants to purchase it.",24.2
"this is one of the best games ive ever played! i recommend buying this game.",336.3
"i can highly reccomend this game if you are into any sort of simulators, or realistic combat. i have had extreme amounts of fun with all of the user created missions, with or without friends. i reccomend once you have purchased this game to follow these steps to have an early look at the zeus free dlc as it can add a whole extra level of enjoyment with the mission ever changing due to your actions, in the state of mind of the dungeons and dragons role playing board game. this is ow you can have early access to the dlc: >purchase and download arma 3 >right click arma 3 in your steam library >click properties >up the top, you will see a betas tab, click it >the click the dropdown arrow next to opt out of all betas and change it so you are opted into the betas >click ok and return to your library, you should see an update for arma 3, around 1gb >if not, launch hte game, the update should now start >once the update has finished, launch arma 3 >from the main menu play multiplayer >from the server browser, find any server that is marked with a [dev] tag, this will be running the zeus dlc >play around on a couple servers, find which one takes your fancy >enjoy! that should be all i need to say, oh, have i told you to buy this game yet? jus jus just.... do it. take a leap of faith.",434.1

"worst arma game in history. it feels more like cod or battlefield due to when you run you can see your wepon on the screen. the graphics are amazing but the graphics dont make the game. the realism is there due to the new stamina system and in vehicles you need more than one person to make it effective but they really didnt do what they promised like putting the take on helicopters flight model in so the helis feel like vtol planes when you fly really fast. i also dont like how it is set in the future because it cant be a simulation if it is in a era we have no clue about. and the weapons sound like your firing marsh mellows at people the 50. cal machine gun on the pickup trucks sound so quite when i fire a mounted gun i want to have the feeling that im shooting a 27mm gun with my hands not that im just firing another lmg. finally the nato forces dont have any jets in the vanilla game but the opfor and indpendents do it should be the other way around and also the lack of planes, helis and ifvs is terrible there should be more ifvs than tanks and thats not the case, if i want to take a patrol out im not going to take 2 mbts and a ifv im more likely to take a mbt and 2 ifvs im patroling not trying to take an airbase. those are the reasons you should not waste 60 dollers on arma 3.",112.8
"do not play this game with a keyboard and mouse. keyboard controls are ungodly complicated and scattered all over the place. even worse, the games tutorial outright lies to you about the keyboard and mouse controls. case in point, the game tells you to hold the second mouse button to use optics/iron sights. this is a lie. you actually have to double-click the right mouse button, then hold it. recommendable if youre interested in a complex, in-depth tactical shooter, but please, do not try to play this game with a keyboard and mouse.",0.8
"arma 3: arma the almighty miletary sim, which may catch your eye with the immersive feel and the futuristic feel which i will get to later. i feel that this is a good arma but not on the same par as arma 2 which can i tell you can be either a bag of piss or alot of fun to play with bugs and  ai to some of the most action packed immersive combat you will experience to date. arma 3 delivers what it sets out to do an invasion of a made up map and you need to help secure it (sorry if you would class that as a spoiler). there are few if any bugs and beautifull graphics great multiplayer improvement from arma 2 but as a fan of the series i am a bit dissapointed in bohemia with their choice of a futeristic feel which i dont personally like compared to modern combat. if you are a laid back gamer you will still enjoy this title due to the community, multiplayer, beauty, editor. the editor is my favourite part of the game as it lets you be creative and put what you would want in a campaign mission into your own. overall i would reccomend this game but if you are looking for an army sim go for arma 2 by far.",49.6
"love this game amazing game to play meet new friends hang out with friends i would recommend this game to everyone i knew.",391.8
"after playing in a few ops with my team. i can, honestly, say that arma 3 was worth the $59.99. it is so realitic that it adds so much immersion that it makes you feel like you are there fighting the good fight. 10/10 will buy arma 4 if they make one.",11.8
"definnitly not for every body but a good choice for those who enjoy a more tactical shooter, and by tactical i mean really effin tactical like u die in two shots, need to take 10 minutes planing ur next move tactical. like i said definatly not for everybody but a good alternative to cod and bf. 8/10",147.0

"arma is one of those few games dedicated to a niche market. with arma 3 the team has made the game more accessible for newcomers to the series whilst still maintaining the steep learning curve associated with the series. the lovely new graphical fidelity and the improved animations combined with a dedicated and growing community (with its awesome custom made content) make this a hefty game to invest in...but with limitless replayability and intense amounts of co-op fun.",179.3
"ill be honest with you. i did complain a lot when this game came out, especially since i was used to playing bohemia interactives other games (arma, arma ii, ofp & addons). but after its birth pangs, arma iii really panned out as an incredible game. better graphics, incredible editor, and countless of tidbits that make this game as real as it can get as a combat simulator. and it has a healthy addon community that allows you to add everything from different camo & armor, to other vehicles, single player missions, campaigns, etc. with this passionate community, you want to brilliantly recreate conflicts ranging from the vietnam war to the current conflict between kurds and the islamic state. if you are really into modern warfare and every detail of it (logistics, recon, full-spectrum dominance, etc.) then get this game.",255.6

"i know that bohemia always says that what describes arma is not simulation, but they are the company that has always been ahead of others in terms of simulation. arma is not just a game, its a totally different experience from the others and that worth a lot. i totally recommend this experience to everybody.",148.7
"the greatest military sandbox i have ever played, arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game, giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy. singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. its a challenge to learn but well worth it. the main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. user-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer. multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. you can play it as a roleplayer, joining life servers. you can be a survivor of the wastes in wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. the greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. with the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. it gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling. if you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, arma 3 is for you.",763.8

"okay, this is the thing here, the game is actually good. the graphics are the , the game is nice and fun, but there is just one thing, so tremendously horrible that it ruins the whole entire game, and thats how it runs. it is not well polished, and if you have an amd processor you can just throw it out of the window. my computer is a very good computer. it has no problems with lagging, fps, and crashes. this is the first game that i had a very low fps on. now they did promise to somehow patch this huge issue, but the thing about that promise, is we might as well cut off the developers pinkie finger now if you catch my drift. that promise was made a long time ago! an extremely long time ago! not only that, but if your looking for action, this is most definitely not the game for you. play something from battlefield, that will give you some aldrenaline rushes. take your 60 dollars, and buy titanfall. i played that game and you can really get into it! but, when you look at it like a simulator, it is a bit fun. i would give this game a 6 out of 10, but since its 60 ing dollars, i have to put this down to 4/10. if the game were to patch it, and fix the lag, i would give it an 8/10 and recommend it, if they lowered the price to atleast $45, i would recommend it and give it a higher rate.",53.2

"i would reccomend, i mostly play altis, king of the hill and i tired to play battle royale (royale with cheese) with no luck. i will try to do so again. its fun, much better than arma 2 in my opinion, some would disagree... each to their own. cars would be better if you could control them better, as well as them not breaking if you tap something. would buy, but only if 50% off like i did in the summertime sale. this game is not worth the full current price of 35.99 or the deluxe version of 39.99. so i suggest waiting for the winter or summer sales. but non the less still a good fun game, even if you are playing alone, if you have friends to play with, im sure its much more fun!",15.7

"a very good game enjoy playing king of the hill which is a really good multiplayer mode also like the wasteland mod. if you are bored of the same old shooter like cod and bf then get this but there is a very big learning curve for new players but if you wait it out and keep at it the game gets loads better. also the moddng community is massive for this game and if you get bored there loads of new mods to choose from 9/10 would be 10 but im still not good enough and sometimes the ai getts annoying because they are good and i get killed a lot but to be fair thats my fault.",71.7

"arma 3 is a good composed game. i couldnt stop playing since it merges you into a intense war atmosphere. it was cool getting into a car with a bunch of people and riding to kill an enemy group on altis life rpg (one of the many cool gamemodes). some things that you will need to get used to is walking and not seeing action for a while (which make those fights 10 times better). but if you want a zombie survival type of gamemode do epoch (which is pretty fun). also another gamemode is sandbox, which you go into a world with a bunch of people and test and monkeying around with the vechiles and guns (helps you get used to the gun physics). arma 3 is a good for 59.99$ when it includes 4 different gamemodes. also would like to state this game wont be like any other shooter you will ever play hope you think my review was helpful. (warning the game will crash your pc if you dont have the requirements)",12.6

"great game -- but i miss the oldschool cti missions and warfare. ive been playing cti since mike melvin first started it with his mfcti missions in the original operation flashpoint: cold war crisis -- all the way up through warfare benny edition and oden warfare in arma ii. it has always been my favorite game mode -- along with odens city fight series. ;)",1.5

"i enjoyed playing this game on the free weekend, but i dont think this game is worth $60. by now it should have dropped a little and arma ii should be free buy now.",19.1
"this is possibly the most realistic and entertaining military simulator ive ever had the joy to play. my absolute favorite part is the flying. the planes and helicopters in this game fly better than any flight simulator ive seen. i have only experienced a fraction of the game, yet im already hooked. creating missions is very fun, but it takes a little bit to get used to the mechanics. i highly recommend this game. 9.99/10",30.9
"this is a hardcore militry simulator you could roleplay from marines to navy seals and has an amazing editor and unlike arma 2 it has under water experince and submarines and way better graphics now i dont play many simulators but this is one of my favorits",1.0
"it took them far too long to polish this turd for me to recomend anything bis is involved with. yeah the game is ok now that they have finally added the features that should have been there from day dot, but i bought a physical copy of the deluxe edition from eb and as such i expected a finished game, not the alpha/beta i was confronted with. it should never have been on shelves 6 months ago let alone when i bought it back in 2013. and you would think deluxe edition implies that at least *some* of the dlc would be included. nope. not sodeluxe then is it? imagine buying a new car, and on your way out of the dealership the shady salesman casualy states oh just so you know even though you have a dashboard, none of the dials or switches work. but as soon as we get some in we can install them for a nominal fee. seems a bit rude dosent it? paying for something and realizing it dosent even come close to expectations. and the excuse why not just use mods is just a sad way of admiting the game isnt finished and/or it isnt any good on its own. and even though i may pick it back up and try again i really dont see myself spending anywhere near the time i had intended to as the experience has left a very bitter taste in my mouth.",15.0
"if you ever wanted an army game simulator, you should look after arma series. caution: cod players wont survive !",324.2

"this game is one of the best games i played. was a huge fan of the battlefield series but after the battlefield 4 fail i bought arma 3. there has not been a single moment i regred it. there are enough servers/ gamemodes and there are so many ways you can play the game. there is no end at it you can make you own server and play some missions whit some friends. the players can be  some times and there are still alot of bugs in the game. but overall its a great game",994.4
"a really fun game that is a great improvement compared to arma 2 when it comes to combat and animations as well as the variety of gamemodes. however, the game is a little unfinished or requires a little more refurbishment when it comes to general points such as audio and factions (combat audio such as firefight sounds including distancing of gunshot sounds is disapointing). however, overall, the game is a deffinate must buy and some improvements can be made with few simple mods easy to download.",657.5
"this is brutal war simulator. one hit can kill. stay in cover and watch your six. awesome! wannabe rambos are cannon fodder in this game, guaranteed. if you like realistic warfare game, this is for you. my most memorable game session so far; sneak through a large village, armed only with 9mm weapon and binoculars. was not exactly walk in the park but at the end i was armed to the teeth, thanks to (less) friendly soldiers who kindly donated their gears to me ;)",16.3
"could have been better.... one of the best looking engine out right now, but unfortunatly suffers from performance issues even on high end pcs. probably most realistic military simulator out. but i think i can say its nothing compared to the original operation flashpoint from bohemia. that was one of the best games ever including its expansion red hammer where your a spetznas. overall, would give it a much better rating if it didnt run like a turtle.",36.7
"missleading requirements.... the minumun cpu is i5.. this game is garbage for amd cpus as well.. this game would had been amazing but the programmers of this game, game engine are noobs in their proffession.. its a stoneage technology.. seriously they should fire every programmers they have and recriut newly graduate... their employees need to go back to school.. you cannot call them professional anymore.. people with high end pc should boycot this so that we will be forcing them to freaking create app that can use of multicore cpus....",133.5

"this game is very very fun if you look past the bugs and glitches. this is one of my favorite games beside arma 2.",327.5
"great game, bad optimization so if you have a low spec pc this game may run slow and have low fps. the gameplay is great, the vehicles and aircraft are great fun and are easy to drive / handle. but there is not many guns and vechicles within this game. the guns handle well and realistic, they also look great and the game has nice animation. the new stances are amazing and really allow you to take cover not matter what the object is you are taking cover behind. over all fun game, lots of gamemodes online to play, single player is ok, but do not recommend getting this game for single player. there is also some mods online which change the game quite a bit. i do recommend getting this game.",825.0
"one of the better fps games on the market.a must have game.better than call of s and battlefield. 10/10",6.6
"a highly tactical kind of fps, what with it being a mil-sim and all. this is a great game for those who want to take fps at a slower and more calculating pace, and it definitely rewards you for being a professional player. that said, the player base that actually has groups to play with are very professional, regardless of age. i do recommend this game to those who seek a quasi-realistic experience at being a soldier.",129.3
"great game with infinite possibilites due to a sandbox world, if you plan on buying this game, you should also consider getting a high end cpu if you want to play on large multiplayer server.",103.3
"day 1: ran around altis with no idea what to do, got kidnapped, kidney stolen. day 2: found a car, gun and armor, tried to team with a guy, knocked out and got my kidney stolen. day 3: killed a guy for his gear, got attacked by 6 of his friends, kidney stolen. definitely reccomend this game",64.9
"cannot and will not stop playing. logged over 850 hours and still going strong. the game never had a lot going on for a while but with all the fine tweeking bohemia have done and are still doing which in turn is allowing some really fantastic mods to either port over form arma 2 or ones that are completely new come onto the scene. with all the current dlc and the marksman dlc on its way plus the winners of make arma not war announced there has never been a better time to get on and get stuck in. whether its life youre into, base building on wasteland/epoch or just blowing and shooting the hell out of stuff on king of the hill, if zombies is your thing try breaking point (these being the most popular) , if you cannot find something you like then you are doing it wrong. but i will not sugar coat it too much but it can be a steep learning curve for those new to the game and yes there are performance issues for some and it can be a challenge for some rigs but the game is still good at 30fps or dare i say it even 25(from personal experience). there are many forums with tips, tweeks and setups that can help you get the most from your arma experience. it may take a little bit of time but it is worth it.",901.1
"this game has kept me very entertained over the few days after buying it. i absolutly loved playing arma ii and thought it was time to upgrade. this game has extremely good graphics and has very good gunplay. however unless you are playing with friends it can get a bit boring also the multiplayer is not 100% optimised yet as you still get dropped frames and lag spikes quite often even though i ahve less than 50 ping on the server and beat the minimum requirements outstandingly. so if you have some friends who play this game i would recommend buying this game deifnately a killer.",181.9
"if you like being a terrorist (which i do) this game is perfect for you just simply set up car bomb and blow up infidel no problem!",40.2

"very good game, perfect resolutions, and nice settings, the game is fun to play, awesome, chillin with friends, but lots of glitches that needed to be fixed.",47.1
"just a quick review. i have played the arma series from the beginning, and have also been a massive fan since then, so you will have to fogive my bias.... ill get to the main points, arma is realistic, detailed and strategic in its game play, not just a run and gun game... i am currently only playing the campaign, but the effort gone into this can be clearly seen, the graphics are intense and the ai are more robust. so far im enjoying it :)",12.1
"this game is very good but u cant find servers with good ping for all players.. the game got huge lagg issues that makes the multiplayer a non competative game..",16.1
"although this game does have its qwerks, like other arma games, the large scale and extensive detail in graphics makes up for it. the game offers endless fun and although is better with friends, you can make friends who play arma 3 all the time very easily. would recommend for anyone interested",114.1
"its a playground if you put your mind to it. lasing targets, flying jets, piloting a sumbmarine, or just firing tracers into a dark stormy night is only a grain of sand in a desert. jump in feet first and enjoy!",400.7
"hosnetly not that fun. the controls are very clunky and the interface is unintuitive.",3.2
"this game is in full aaa price and you just stop making content for it and want to charge for dlcs? i hate you scammers!!! this game is terrible, there is a huge lack of content for the original price, the single player campaing sucks and the multiplayer modes are only created by the community, i thought bohemia had learned from arma 2, dont ever buy this game, unless you have  tons of money, you will be sick of it after one day.",295.1
"do not buy this game if your single core performance is low. for example all amd cpu users, amd is always a good choice for every other game except arma. the game only runs on the first two cores of your cpu which makes intel the better choice. this game barely even touches the graphics card which in my opinion is very  backwards considering how advanced gpus are. the game would be fun if it would run, hopefully multicore support is a thing in a later date. i suggest and i5 or i7 processor if you are ever going to get frames online with this piece of junk. the game is fun though just the multiplayer servers have a trend of playing really  game modes such as stratis life and any form of wasteland. in my opinion the game should be more structured and focused on team based combat rather than every man for themselves on 200km squared (or however large the map is).",112.4
"so, i built my pc specifically to play dayz and such games. then arma 3 was released and i shyd away from the zombie series and into full on warfare instead. after coming from the cod franchise and the battlefield games, i was scepticle that i could be any good playing warfare on such a massive scale, let alone on pc. i got cracking and found that this game was actually very very well built. the graphics are smooth and crisp (depending on your setup) the gameplay is solid and immrsive and you quickly get sucked in to the firefights and stuff. campaign i found was a little left out, it felt like the game was centred as much around the multiplayer aspect as possible (i was used to that from playing cod) overall its an awesome game, would recommend just for the multiplayer part.",68.5
"fun as hell! great game, only complaint is.... no jump. really!! epic fail in that department as your legs into the floor of the cement pad you try to climb on to. i will say amazing game other then that though,",157.3
"great game! i would recommend to those who love first person/third person shooters and realistic shooters cant get anymore real than this :)",18.9
"is a good game,but price is to hight....but a good game!",8.2
"greatest military game i have ever played. realistic physics, vehicles, aeroplanes, jets, etc. it is extremely fun to play with friends, especially on custom gamemodes like altis life, epoch, wasteland and others. almost every building is enterable and detailed. the community make this game fun, and never ending. you can always do something new! 10/10",30.2
"great game, so many game modes its hard to get bored.",361.2
"slow,laggy,choppy not such a good game. you gotta have a good computer",0.6
"do not purchase this game if you are looking for something akin to cod or battlefield. however, if you want something slower-paced that actually makes you feel important without being an invincible juggernaut who slaughters his way through the forces of evil, then this game is likely a good choice. approach it tactically, learn your keybindings, play as a team, and this game is bar-none the most satisfying military shooter around. arma 2 is another competitor, but with the improvements to character movement, vehicle handling, and sheer non-gloomy atmospherics, i would have to say this iteration of the franchise ekes it out to be the one i would play first. but yeah, its a great way to meet people and a hell of a lot of fun with friends! but for the love of everything, if you dont know how to fly, dont try on a server where people can!",130.3
"this game is such an improvement from arma 2, its graphics are amazing and it is well optimized. it is well worth the price and has many cool features and multiplayer gamemodes which is a normal thing for any arma game. i played 1 episode of the campaign, it seemed ok but the multiplayer is where its at with this game!",156.7
"an absolutely beautiful looking game. if you like military combat thats about decision making more than how good you are with a gun then this is a game for you. the simulatory aspect, with a huge arsenal of vehicles and weapons. with amazing steam workshop support and game mods, all coupled into a new engine with ragdoll physics, smoother frame rate on an absolutely massive real world island makes this game a fantastic, realistic and fun playing experience.",103.7
"great simulation mechanics and awesome graphics fidelity.",142.7
"now when the game finally has gotten some improvements to the framerate... its still just playable. anyone that thinks his got a bad computer should not buy this game. it will need the best pc components out there to even get near 60fps. poorly optimised game, but once you found the settings that works with your computer it can be a fun game. but still the slow movement, stopping while changing weapon is a deal breaker. im dissapointed that they didnt learn anything from arma 2. what i think about the game 1 is worst 5 is best graphics = 5 gameplay = 3 sound = 2 optimised = -3 playable? sure when you got the best pc there is to buy and nothing better to do.",44.6
"highly recomend this game to anyone who wants to buy it as there is no game crashing bugs, lots of fun in battle royal and for people who like a mixture of guns and drugs scareface style should really play altis life rpg.",35.5
"if you havent already bought this game, its a must buy!!!! its 40% off atm get it while you can!!!",584.0
"to sum up arma 3. amazing workshop community, and creations. the singleplayer scenarios are great and well put together. on the other multiplayer can be a little spotty at times, fps could be much, much better. your fps is somewhat dependant on the server your playing on, which is kind of unfortunate. with that being said, it is an amazing game or milsim which ever one you like to call it. i would recommend it to anyone with a decent enough computer and a knack for hardcore military gameplay. -the only god",459.1
"the latest iteration of bohemia interactives fantastic combined arms military simulation series, arma 3 provides players with a vast amount of gameplay, both through official content and user-created content. the sheer scope of the title is incredibly impressive for any developer, and the quality of the tools provided for users to create their own dynamic experiences is a strong selling point for this title. gameplay in the title is diverse, ranging from the more serious military operations to the more lighthearted experiences such as altis life. the mission editor is a joy to work with, and can allow for even novice players to begin crafting whatever scenario they can imagine. overall, i would recommend this game to any gamer who is patient enough to enjoy a realistic infantry simulation, with semi-realistic vehicle simulation included. the game does require a fairly powerful computer, which may deter gamers with lower-end systems.",44.9
"if your into war games this is the one. realistic and lots of fun with friends.",332.0
"after playing the free days i was inlove with arma 3... if you into military tactical simulations you will too, from diving, ground support, armour support and air support this game has unlimited things to do ( war wise) theres also a mod for this on the servers that lets you lve a life in the eyes of a civilian, cop or terrorist! i do recomend buying this game, it will bring happiness with it! go arma!",187.5

"beautiful, engaging, and extremly difficult. would recommend to anyone who enjoys a challenge and who enjoys very realistic combat and tactics. very, very difficult to those not used to the arma franchise. there is no example usable to describe this game except the other games in the series. in terms of enjoyablility and gameplay 10/10, but to anyone used to standard 1st person shooters(battlefield, cod, etc.) it should be graded as an 8/10.",11.4
"this game is the best simulation fps ever made. sure it still has to expand. but even at this point you have unlimited hours of playing with super realistic challenges, mission editor, campaings, different multiplayer games etc. the game gives you a variety of options from squad commands to character and vehicle movements (you have submarines too :p). the shooting is as realistic as a game can offer you nowadays. if you didnt like arma 2 dont think that arma 3 is the same. you must check it out. in the end i think that you should buy this game if you like a bit more realistic fps and want some real challanges to face. see you on the field soldier!",34.2

"its a good game, it has its pros and cons. there are a lot of bugs, but those are not major, the servers work fine and there are a lot of dedicated servers. the game has a lot of good mods (rp mods, zombie survival mods) breaking point and epoch are my favourite. there are a lot of game modes and scenarios in the game. thanks to the steam workshop the game has a lot of features that you can add in.",411.5

"following the hit arma 2, arma 3 is just as good, maybe better. boy oh boy these graphics are to live for, featuring realistic snakes, this game is worth every dime. another thing is the flying of helicopters, its quite gay if i do say so myself. so youre probably wondering, is this game good enough for me and my family?  yes, i give this game an outstanding 18 out of 10, enjoy.",79.0
"im not going to pay this money for this game - totally not, you shouldnt. 1st you should get a better gpu, and i mean a very good gpu, arma 3 still needs better optimization. 2nd wait for multiplayer fixes, it still has some desync insues here and there, multiplayer performance needs improvement. 3rd why do i need ot wait for multiplayer fixes when i can play singleplayer? - well arma is made for coop action, and by this i mean join a clan/ group/ unit that knows how to play the game correctly. 4th buy it and you will see it will be worth it!",653.4

"amazing sand box game. dont come here expecting fast/arcade action like battlefield... this game is a marathon, not a sprint. single player is still plenty fun, multi-player is classic arma... the campaign is a mix of unfair vs. too easy depending on your loadout and how many saves you allow yourself. some modding is essential to get the best out of the game as well. if you like doing mission design, youll have a blast with the tools provided, but they are almost completely undocumented, so its pretty hard core getting started.",416.3

"so this one is a weird one. on the one hand this game can be an amazing amount of fun whilst playing several different mods already integrated into the system. it is some of the most tense fun ive had in a strategic fps. the game also looks pretty dang good, on the other hand this game screams beta, with bugs a plenty lack of many features that was avilible in arma 2. for example bi-pod integration still hasnt been going in. that alongside the dlc being added even though the game is extremely unpolished. simply put: arma 3 is great but also a big dissapointment from me. 6.5/10 p.s performance is still a huge problem for many people so make sure you can run it!",257.2

"this is arma 3, not call of duty. you need to practice communication, strategy, situational awareness, as well as being able to listen!!!!! listening is above all else the most important. unlike fail of duty, you need to help the squad you are in when in multiplayer mode; not who can have the biggest electronic  and showing they are on the top of the list. all this shows is that you are a gloryhog and a piss poor player, but mostly an , that will have you excluded from future multiplayer games. also unlike fail of duty the calibre of rifles plays key as well as environment conditions, like bullet drop and wind. if you play call of duty, this game is not for you! go play with the other prepubescent inbreds, or socially/maturity  adults, to compare imaginary  with and see who is the biggest  of all. if you do like tactics and strategy, then this game is for you. again, if youre a call of duty player, look forward to the next craptacular expansion of that horrible series.",53.6

"this has got to be the most challenging, strategic, and fun game on the market. if you like using your brain to get yourself out of seemingly impossible situations then this game is for you. the first campaign mission was not as fun but as the story develops the missions get better and better. the game is also absolutely stunning and looks like a movie at all times.",29.6
"this game has me feeling mixed emotions. you jump in to the singleplayer and find the game to be very tactical and have a lot, and i mean a lot, of controls. then you get into combat and see that its not as forgiving as other games. the challenge does make for some entertainment though. after you may want to check out multiplayer. youll find that there is tons of servers. most of them playing mods like altis life and wasteland. these are indeed fun. as soon as you jump in youll see tons of problems. none of which ive seen in singleplayer. the cars will be flying, animations crap up, and horrific frame rate drops. after all of this, i had a lot of fun. i did have friends to play this though. i would recommend this game, but it may not be as enjoyable without friends as with them. 8/10. all criticisms aside, its still a game that is worth your money.",56.8

"true military simulator. it includes nearly everything that would be in an amazing military sim. there are so many things that i cant list them all, but ill do my best: pros -open world -realistic fatigue & gun movement (can be a con) -coriolis effect -realistic flight -realistic driving -realistic damage -realistic exposions & radious - if someone dies in your squad it can impact the game greatly -unlike many other military games, if something goes wrong in arma, you have to improvise, and you usually have to improvise fast, instead of going back to a checkpoint -no checkpoints -moddable -world/map editor to make your own levels or to just expirement and have fun cons -figuring everything out can be a hassle, and ive played over 70 hours and still havent figure out everything -the world can look untexturized and people are sometimes halfway in the ground when looking through a sniper rifle scope -can be a bit clunky at times while working in the world editor so overall, arma 3 is amazing and you should stop reading this review & buy it immediaty like, right now immediatly",73.4
"bohemias gone to immense effort to create real, immersive environments for arma 3. across two sprawling islands youll find all kinds of terrain, from salt-flats to forests to stretches of rocky coastline. even without a directed experience, just spawning into those maps is a pleasurable experience, letting you explore and discover some amazing virtual places. arma 3 is also that rare  these days  game that will push all but the most powerful pc hardware. it looks amazing even on older systems, but if you want to crank it up at eye-bleeding resolutions youre going to see performance loss.",48.8

"the game itself is remarkable. arma2 + much better graphics. the mechanics require some getting used to, but the gameplay is fun and very realistic. excellent combat simulator. if you are not used to combat sims, there is a steep learning curve, but it is much easier to learn than in arma 2. the action and movement mechanics are much more fluid. once you get bored of singleplayer there is multiplayer involving co-op (team up with others to complete objectives), wasteland (join one of 2 factions, or go at it alone on island, surviving and killing others), and a plethora of scenarios and mods to play with. most of my gametime is currently on the breaking point mod. the mod gives an unique experience than just normal multiplayer. you will have to use tatics and strategy to survive from zombies, nature, and other hostile players. i had this game since alpha release and it is a must get if you loved arma ii and dayz. if you want a realistic, tatical shooter, this is it. no call of duty, counter-strike, battlefield  here. beware you will need (cpu) processing power to run this game. gpu power not so much.",542.5
"such graphics much fun many guns can your computer run?",10.3
"i have been playing with the arma series since arma 2, and i cna honestly say arma 3 not only vastly improves on amra 2, but it also has the best community in gaming i have ever seen.",937.3
"pretty realistic game. but it sometimes takes 20-30 min to find an enemy to kill. but still fan.",7.1
"completely recommend it, its one of the best games ive ever played, the great realism and tactical ability allows you to do practically anthing you want within the boundries great gammodes and mostly good comunity, always going to be one of my favourite games, hope you enjoy it as much as i have, try it even if your not sure, i can almost garaunte youll love it!!",146.4
"arma 3 is the first game i wanted to buy after completing my computer. i have had previous experiences on a xbox 360 console but this is the first shooter i have ever played on a pc, and it is the shiz. arma 3 has a relatively easy learning curve that can get you mashing the right controls within a few hours of playing it. there will be times when your fps will drop down quite a bit, even if you are running top of the line graphic cards, but regardless it is in my opinion a outstanding game. is it worth the money?!?!?! huh cowboysandwich? if you are a arma noob like me yes it is, but if your returning to arma dont take my word for it, like i said before regardless it is a good game. you will spend a ungodly amount of your time playing this game. 10/10",87.4
"extremely fun and addicting pros -everything about it cons -need a good computer.",72.6
"im going to be completely honest, i bought this game almost exculsively to play the battle royale game mod. as such, i have played very little of the actual campaign of vinilla experience. i can say though that if you like or enjoyed arma style games, you will appreciate the leve of detail and dedication to realism this series provides. the controls are responsive, and the guns handle amazingly. every time i died, it was 99% my fault and the other the lag i blame and curse over the microphone as i mourn my body. if you apprciate more realism to your games then straight up, over the top action, i would recomend giving this series a try. i did not mind spending the money and i bought this before the summer sale. i would highly recomend looking at the modding scene as well which is normally very active with arma series titles (look at the dayz mod)",7.8
"the graphics are great, and there is a lot of stuff in the game from mortars to drones, helicopters and jets, tanks, civillian and millitary transport vehicles etc. it requires a great deal of skill to pilot/use some of these. the multiplayer is really good, and you can play altis life rpg, wasteland, co-op, king of the hill and more. 85% of community is great and much more mature compared to other fps games. the only thing i dont like very much is infantry movement, not sure why though, feels different. overall its a great experience, i recommend it.",355.0
"great game, loads of mods have come out for it. problem only exists is that its still badly optimized for amd cpus. and to top it off, there is no official mods that add in content, that have been released.",496.0
"this is gonna be est game ever i see you dont make dayz mode for arma 3 but its not gonna happen u create new game for day z u published videos for u are working on arma 3 for dayz you guys said you are going to publish it soon u tricked people",343.5
"i need 1.28 update steam is on auto update , no update available for me . i cant play mp . love the game sucks to be me",12.4
"yes i do and its nice fun cool hard to kill me but u can but one prob not enough money for the dlcs thats to much arma 3 is to much i recomend price droping to 30$ i sen more people buy it at 30$ not at 60$ but its a good gam best shooting ae on steam beside tf2 (team fortress 2) its good but this is 11/11 good job :)!",18.7

"*for what it has to offer, this game is amazing. being able to accept foreign content is a huge plus! the game itself is amazing! never before have i experienced anything like arma 3. i highly recommend this game to anyone interested in realistic combat and not that c#ck of duty sh#t. for christs sake, there are hundreds of mods out there that transform arma into a whole new game! *there is the epoch mod!  apocalyptic simulator. *there is the breaking point mod! (my personal favorite) it pretty much kicks dayzs . it is everything dayz wanted to be, but couldnt. i have never in my life actually got an adrenaline rush from a video game such as the one i get from this one. when you hear the crack of a bullet whiz over your head, you know you are probably gonna die. and the players on breaking point are ruthless to say the least! you can think that you are best buddies with another player, then they will turn on you in a heart beat. i mean really you can even pretend to be a zombie! it is insane! *there is also some sort of dinosaur mod out there! *this game has so much potential that it makes me wonder why not everyone has adopted it yet. *get a part time job, buy arma 3! then quit the job, and play arma 3! it is that easy!!! *very great game!",629.5
"its arma, no doubt about that, all the previous features you would ever want are there. it is just unfortunate that the issues that plagued arma ii have not even been improved upon, let alone fixed. *edited july 2014* the variety and quality of the mods compared to arma ii is absolute rubbish, but hopefully that changes. the game desperately needs the ace mod too. it is essentially the good old broken as hell game that we all love",87.3
"so, another amazing game from bohemia. arma3 is very beautifull and well made game. from arma2 it got more into simulation part, but lacks some vehicles and weapons variety, but all of that is being add... with purchasable dlc (that sucks, but for this game- worth it).",122.0
"this game is a must have if you like milsim. it is very realistic, and has a great community. wasteland is for those who enjoy killing everyone in sight even if they are wearing the same camo. deathmatch is meh. coop missions are some of the best game modes. if you are new to the series, check this out, the controls are a little strange at first, but you will grow to love them.",570.2
"awesome game! you will need more than a decent computer to run this game though.",186.2
"this game is a buggy piece of  the commuinity ranges between  talking s too ai stomping nerds who think they are commander big , with a few normal people inbetween. but its a great game that is hugely intensive and adrenaline filled. there is plenty to do, plenty of missions to play and mods to download. amazing graphics. once you become familiar with the mechanics and weapons etc. the game is absolutely amazing, just give it a try.",571.1
"give it about a 8.5/10 all the servers are good especially altis life, the campaign is good, a bit hard though. alot of the servers has s running them, but what game will you go to that doesnt. although, great game.",509.4
"arma 3 is one of the best games there is way better than bf4 and cod but at the moment the game is broken since the latest update and devs have no clue how to fix it so i would check forums to see if it is fixed before buying .when it works its a great game .",302.8
"when do u get rid of your global ban i did have it over 1 years and 4 months",357.4
"i found solitaire more fun 1. scopes dont zoom propely 2. multiplayer games are boring and have no point to them.. if you enjoy running around empty land gettin randomly shot by nothing and getting kicked out for no reason its great 3. no way to communicate with others in multiplayer and single player would be better if controls worked jus glad i did the free weekend and not wasted 30 bucks like i was going to",5.6

"excellent game if you have a half decent pc. people whinge about not much content but i found there is plenty for everything that i need and i believe most people need. if more content is needed, there are plenty to choose from. some of the mods such as breaking point (a zombie game on altis) are far superior to the dayz sa and most dayz for arma mods without the building as yet. i am sure that sa will get better but with patches few and far between it will take some time. arma 3 multiplayer is also very enjoyable with some mates and a few beers. certainly worth it if your into a bit of realism compared to other aa or aaa titles. be patient with the game, the end result is awesome all around.",781.7
"literally the best military sandbox in the market today.",61.6

"if you live simulator games like gta and dayz and stuff of that sort, you will love this game. i have clocked almost 1000 hours into it, and i dont regret it. its got endless things to do with mods, altis life, battle royale, breaking point, and tons more. 10/10 buy this game worth any amount of money.",761.7
"pros: great graphics lots of stuff to use (clothing, weapons, vehicles, etc) huge improvement over character control from previous games ballistic system cons: terrible ai lack of standard game modes (most servers are either altis/stratis life or invade and annex againts bots) bad netcode can cause sync problems poor distance display handling (why is this overlooked in a game that relays on such a huge playground baffles me) should: decrease gameplay area (80% of the terrain is never used) include gameplay similar to that of battlefield 2: project reality. that kind of gameplay plus these graphics and contents = insta win all in all, a recommended game. could get some more pvp focused developing, but still plenty of fun flying, driving, shooting, etc.",260.0

"very good game the graphics are overall amazing.the gameplay is very smoth for me.i always have the now and then crashes but other then that amazing game!",159.9
"love it! very hard learning curve, but well worth the effort. you do need a bloody good graphic card, mind you!",18.9
"a great game... if you mod it. the base game is fine in multiplayer but lacks an immersive story. with some of the mods however it is as if having multiple games.",881.5
"i started the game up and when i got onto the main menu, i crashed. 10/10 goty",78.7
"this game may only be in alpha phase right now, but so far, the game looks fantastic! bohemia have really captured that fun and intuative gameplay we first saw in operation flashpoint. everything about this game so far is so much better than arma 2, and the new features and graphics are fantastic. id even compare this to a full release even at this stage in the games development!",260.4
"arma 3 is one of the best games i play; with its large maps and units. even after the singleplayer and senarios are finished you can do things such as: the editor, multiplayer or zeus. something to do in arma 3 that i would recomend is to go on a co-op server, such as ahoyworldss invade and annex servers, and play with other people against infantry ai. but even if you find the amount of equipment (e.g. tanks or guns) you can always mod the game. the arma modding comunity is huge, for example if you want to use less modern weapons, you can probably find it, even if you want to scrap the military aspect you can get things such as altislife. therefore i think that this game is a seriously good game and i would recommend it to others.",458.3
"this game is a perfect choice for those who love themselves military simulators. while this game does have its downfalls, aka its glitches, they however, are not game breaking. slow paced gameplay but not so slow as to get boring. i recommend that if you can find a clan, group, or server that is great and lots of fun, stick with it.",511.8
"the multiplayer is fun, but has a lot of performance issues. i wouldnt recommend it full price, but if it is at a 50% discount, buy it!",57.5

"great game keeps me amused for hours. however slightly buggy here and there, but overall a great game!",584.2
"in my experence with the game i have found that it is even more cpu intensive than arma2. unless you have a good cpu i would not recomend getting the game i have a fx 8350 and i only get 30 fps. not to mention arma 2 has abour all the same stuff. overall all a 8/10 game",66.7
"amazing game, completely worth the money and fells smooth running. the new engine and various features is a large step up from arma 2. if hesitant about buying this game, get it now. p.s. - you can play several fun mods on this game including dayz, stratis life, wasteland & more...",536.3

"this game is great, especially with friends, breaking point also adds so much to this already amazing game! :d",230.4
"arma 3 is not as complicated as people make it out to be. after throwing myself into over 50 hours of multiplayer co-op missions, let me tell you this game is way more fun that i ever thought it would be. some missions involving infantry, tanks, aircraft, and artillery are staggering beautiful no matter if the server has 12 or 60 people on it. the only thing getting in the way of this game being perfect is the ui. a strange scroll wheel system to select weapons and execute user actions is something that is not only difficult to learn but doesnt work very well even once you do. minding the small learning curve (mostly due to the ui as stated above), this game is absolutely fanatastic and you shouldnt be afraid of the realism presented- it just makes it all the more fun.",264.3
"great game with the breaking point zambies mod :)! you need a good pc to run it good though xd",40.3
"the best shooter simulation game to surface that comes to mind, with its realistic mechanics and high quality textures/effects its very easy to get lost in the world that is arma iii. as of this review it still shows a notice on loading screens that the game is in beta although besides maybe pointing at its performance optimization issues feels like a finished product. the pros *stunning graphics and effects *realistic game engine (a slightly improved arma ii engine) *great sound assets and background music *large modding community makes for endless gamemode possibilities *good selection of ground and air vehicles *fantastic player fanbase (full of helpful players and those who like to play the part by using military lingo) the cons *horrible performance optimization on even high end setups ****the recommended specs should be the minimum, if you do not meet the recommended spec then forget it**** *video options is trivial, breaks all logic (better fps with shadows on? wot?)",190.8

"sad i wasted my money i love arma 2 even thought it has some bugs but this game has more bugs then content",38.7
"this game.... i must say that i spent so much time building missions and never playing them. there are many good aspects to the game as well. i love the multiplayer where you can play wasteland, life or even missions with your friends. i loved this game even though i had nobody to play it with and that is saying something. 9/10",47.1

"the latest and greatest addition to the arma franchise. this game is the best tactically paced game on the market. you could play vanilla and screw around with friends. or you could go for a fully modded experience. you have many options, you could run a massive drug cartel in arma iii life, shoot your way to the top in battle royale, fight dinosaurs in the new jurassic park mod, or witness the end of the world in many ways, from overpoch, to epoch, to doomsday. find your gamemode and your sure to have a good time.",100.6

"this is my first review. arma 3 is one of the most realistic military sim youll play in awhile. the realism beats battlefield, but is slower. at first if youre not use to it you will wonder how you died. after awhile you will realize that you were shot around 500 meters away. arma 3 is for the players who want more realism than battlefield.the game has many positives and some negatives that i can note. positives: + amazing graphics in some places + big maps (2 really big islands, with one about 270km squared) +a decent amount of vehicles / weapons +alot of uniforms for player customization (using the virtual ammo box, that is present in some servers) + a very good editor and a real time edior named zeus + life like situations with other players + no annoying kids like call of duty negatives: - the campaign does not have a story that leaves an impression - the ai downright has no iq - needs a good computer - the map though big in some places are really just open land - hard to learn the game has its shares of positives and negatives, but will not be like any other game youve ever played. dont buy this game if you wont take the time to learn how to play. that is because it will overwhelm you if you perfer games like call of duty.",249.8

"game is released and its still an unoptimized piece of . just like it was in the alpha... just like arma 2 is right now. out for like 4-5 years still unoptimized and runs like .",156.8
"its a great game if you can overlook the bugs and the desync... i would recomend hopping into a atlis life server then go and make some in game money and make some new friends and have fun! its a really realistic game but ill have to give it 8.27/10 only because its buggy :( but if you overlook the bugs its 9.75/10 on my books!",179.7
"seriously, its not your average battlefield or call of duty shooter... far from! this is real war simulation what all possible factors included! if you want to wage war like a real soldier in life-like situations, this is a game for you. this game however has many different controls and doesnt exactly have a user-friendly control because you need to press multiple buttons mostly to even execute one action, apart from basic movement and such, but if youve ever played any other bohemia interactive game, you should already know that. other than these hard-to-master controls, this game is truely amazing, breathtaking, and even lets you use an editor for putting together your own missions. i personally like it for combat flight simulation.",19.5

"while i do recommend this game, its only thanks to armas modding community. and well in advance. because, while there already are some very good mods and missions for arma 3, the vast majority of them simply is additional content ported over from arma 2. as for the game itself in its vanilla form: thumbs down. bad net code, bad design, awful single-player campaign, terrible bugs (like ai twitching when you hit them with your fire). technologically arma 3 is stuck in 2009. graphics dont age well, it already looks outdated, while being very demanding resource wise - bad optimization. unfortunately, arma 3 doesnt have any competition in simulating combined arms warfare. while every aspect of arma 3 is done poorly, its the only game that comes with all of it in one package.",620.5

"i thoroughly enjoy arma 3. yes, its a fps but primarily its a military simluation game. its very accurate in that regard. the controls can sometimes be a bit wonky, but 3 is a vast improvement over 2 as far as layout and keyboard customization capability. ultimately, the games good trumps over the games bad in my opinion and experiences, and though it could benefit greatly from some polish, its still much better than cod or those style of games for me.",612.0
"the next generation arma awed reviewers with promising graphics and an intense single player campaign. what seemed like a would be goty quickly has faded away. as people slowly, possibly dreadfully make the switch to arma 3 they will see it is a myriad of misfortune. with very little solid content to speak of compared to its predecessor it has left people in want. the game has been an overall disappointment for me, with a lowered sense of viable large scale combat, and very little aircraft to be talked of i was sorely disappointed at bohemia interactives next generation game in the arma series. the only thing that has made it playable is the limitless community made mods to add things that the developers seemingly forgot from arma 2. this causes me to not recommend this game.",226.6
"this game is really cool it is about military simulation if you get shot you got shot not like cod there is a gamemdoe where you can be a cop or a robber or a terrost or a civilian and you can do whatever you want its very fun you got tazers and realistic graphics",640.3

"multiplayer 8/10 - its really great; loads of features, replayablility etc. could do with some new weapons, but for now the multiplayer works very well. single player - 2/10 - it sucks. utterly. you die all the time, ai have laser accuracy and x-ray vision, you fail missions for no reason, i.e. the uav section on death valley - there is no indication of what to do or where to look in this segment, and you have a 2min timer on it. its pointless. overall, in my experience the campaign - even on recruit - is frustrating and a complete waste of time. dont bother. four frustrating hours to complete the first 3 missions with over 40 mission fails (mostly due to deaths) is pointless.",85.1

"severely overpriced considering that people play it because of the mods not because of the campaign mode or vanilla multiplayer. then on top of it they have the nerve to sell dlc that should have been included. they should be giving out large prizes to the top modders since they owe their success to them. bohemia interactive is not reputable at all. if this game was 30 dollars i would consider buying it but not at close to $70. i considered buying their mars game as well but if they overcharge this one i wont take a risk on the other one needing expensive dlc later.",18.4

"i have played the two dlc single player survive and adapt and i found them very interesting and enjoyable to play. the first part survive is more an entry level to arma 3, where you encounter the basic situation of enemy engagement, moving in the wide open territory. hide from enemies. etc. the second part adapt is amazing and brilliant. some missions have intense firefight and they need careful planning, choosing the right position where to engage enemies. is more a guerrilla style of mission, such as the ofp resistance ones. but the gameplay now has really evolved to something reliable, realistic feeling, but also funny to play. i liked it. in the end i suggest to play the dlc campaign to all tactical gamers, who liked ghost recon series, or arma series, or maybe also ofp dragon rising sp campaign. especially arma 3 adapt dlc contains some missions really epic to play! i liked them a lot. cheers !",91.8

"i am plagiarizing the insightful observation of another by writing this, but arma 3 is best thought of as a fairly robust combined arms simulation engine. fun or gameplay arent found in arma itself-- one has to rely largely on community-produced content (scenarios, scripts, custom assets, etc.) in order to have a good time. the ultimate strength and weakness of arma is that the experience you can have is almost completely dependent on how much effort you want to put into building (or discovering) that experience.",129.0
"i do really recomend the game but the game is meant to be $50. i was looking at the arma website and converted it to usd and it said it was around $50. so would i say its a ripoff... no but i do think that steam should lower the amount. this game is worth it but steam just needs to look at that because i was playing the free weekend and it should have been like $25 dollars. i at that time had $20 so maybe we should ask steam to make a free full edition weekend where you could download it and keep it after the weekend finished...",33.3

"this game is amazing for the most part. the map is huge, and the combat is usually fun, but you will most likely have  fps. i would recomend this game, but even with a high end pc you will be at sub 30 fps in cities, making shooting people hard at this point, and can cause you to crash when driving at high speeds. this will most likely make you very frustrated. so until they fix the fps issues dont buy it.",67.6

"must have... it has many mods and unlimited potential. dayz standalone is a mod from this engine. tries to be most realistic looking army based game. supposedly used in different forms to train troops is something ive heard in the past. head swivel look is something more games should have... also leaning and prone, crouch, standing fire... ect.... buy it for $30-$35 usd.",61.6
"what more to say? coming back to this from a few years away and its great to see how its developed. being a fan from arma, arma 2 and even vbs 2, you cant go wrong with checking this out. but there are conditions: you have to love the milsim side of life, you can do anything. you have to persevere also. you will die. again and again... this game will suck you in. big time....",219.1
"pros: this game is just beautiful. very photorealistic! when i first looked around in the game it was like whoa!. i can max it on my gtx 980 in 2k at around 40-50 fps, multiplayer allows a large amount of people to play on massive maps. the controls are great, you can have total control over you player. weapon accuracy is realistic, you cant hit anything without being tactical. it has a great training section that i advise you play before jumping into a server. cons: the muliplayer... i just dont understand. i admit i havent done any research on how to play, i didnt know i had to. i have not met a friendly entity in any game yet. as of now every encounter with another play has resulted in them shooting me, tazering me or hancuffing me to sell to another more advanced player... there is nothing you can do about it, both the faction and the police have simmilar procedures. there are, it seems, 1k commands. it will take a while of remapping for comfort and accessability, let alone learning the bulk of them. conclusion: it looks great and is the most immersive fps i have ever played. so get it! very taxing game on the graphics card. screen shots look amazing, but the 45fps is not enough to be competative, so i will have to turn down settings =( or buy another 980 =)",5.1
"sick of the absurdness of the call of duty franchise or the so called realism of the battle franchise? well switch to arma. with stunning graphics and amazing lighting effects. the realism in this game might be too much for some, but thats what the games about, true realism. no idiot sprinting with a sniper rifle or ramming a jet at tanks here. this game is for the mature audience, not prestige 12 year olds.",49.9

"unlike arma 2 , arma 3 can give much more. not that arma 2 is bad its just that arma 3 is like gmod. if you want to play darkrp you join a server other than downloading the addons and only picking from a small ammount of servers sometimes. along with the ease of access to the numerous amounts of gamemodes it also has a certian play style to it.",243.9

"so at this point youd expect me to write up a status report on arma 3, there is no real knowing of what content creators can make out of arma 3. take altis life, arma life, battle royale, epoch. so many gamemodes that would blow your mind through the roof. this is no battlefield runaround and shootup sort of game, this game requires strategy and full focus from your platoon or team. in doing so you complete alot of intense action missions while playing. war stories beyond belief in this game, i love it to the fullest extent, not matter what bullcrap people say about arma being made by bohemia, they made a good game, that is all i have to say. in the end? yes, its worth every cent you can withdraw have fun guys :)",344.1
"its a nice game. its good if you are into slow and tactical shooters unlike a run and gun call of duty, also a good step up from battlefield. its pretty realistic so no one man armies in this one.",242.5
"a really fun game uses alot of team work and you get to shoot stuff :)",15.0
"fun game to play, especially with friends. i seemed to have been having lag or sensitivity problems with my screen movement, but other than that it is a really cool military simulation that you can really get into. i would recommend this to anyone that likes real, immersive, and tactical combat, and who also even enjoys a bit of role-playing. the graphics are great and the content is pretty cool. ive only played a few multiplayer and mission games with friends, but i definately enjoyed myself.",6.3

"its a pretty good driving simulator if thats what your looking for. on top of the endless bugs, explosions, and hikes, youll find tons of different gamemodes and mods. the modding community really holds this together and without them this would probably be a piece of trash. after the first ten minutes, using the three guns supplied in the vanilla version of this game will get boring. this game is unfinished and shouldnt be bought. i give it a 10/10",69.3

"normally i would say: arma 3 is not a good game. but that would not be fair. arma 3 has big problems. a netcode worse than the bf4 netcode, a poor framerate, at the very most an average campaign and more problems. but all that simply do not matter if it has one of the most active communities which is delivering extremely unique, exciting, funny, hard or just good modifications. and i like these kind of games. and there is the big strength of the game. unlike other developers bohemia interactive does not aim for the ultimate game. they deliver a sandbox where the players can decide what they want to do with it. you want a military simulation? well it is arma... but try other things: roleplaying in altis life, surviving in battle royale or driving a parcour up in the sky with skytrack - it is up to you. we have seen the success of dayz and i am looking forward to all the other mods which will be released in future. but: bohemia interactive! please solve the technical issues, especially the horrible desync and the poor framerates.",791.7

"arma 3 is possibly one of the best military simulation games i have ever experienced. pros: - wide variety of gamemodes - friendly and (mostly) mature communities - multiplayer allows some crazy fun times with as many friends as you can get together - performance is quite good for most instances (see cons for exceptions) cons: - performance in big cities with a lot of players suffers heavily - physics can be a bit derpy in some instances, and result in death - desync! do some research on it, however it is an arma thing - your social life will slowly fade away when you play this game overall: i would easily recommend this game to sandbox/shooter game lovers.",245.6
"where do i start. this game in all its glory has touched my heart . ill be honest its not smooth not for the faint of heart. the animations are smoother then arma 2. this game has so many opurtunities. the modding is a bit tricky but once you get the hang of it. the game is amazing.",365.0

"this is a great game hours of fun i played the altis life mod great will recommended to anyone",326.6
"dont be turned off by the simulator nature of this game. while the combat is meant to be realistic and when youre first starting out it can be a bit daunting to learn all the controls and simply learn how to aim the game underneath is fantastic. the campaign is a great introduction into the mechanics of the game and id highly recommend playing the survive chapter to get a handle on basic infantry gameplay. the game is extremely moddable and its super easy to make your own missions or to download missions made by other players. the game does have performance issues however and is very cpu bound. i found that with my fx 8350 crossfire is useless and results in no performance gain because the processor cant keep up, but if you have a strong single card solution then an fx 8350 will work fine. intel however is the preferred route for this game, but even then dont expect 60 fps gameplay. that said, the game is slow paced enough that 30 fps is more than sufficient and the game is absolutely gorgeous. id absolutely recommend it if youre a fan of games like americas army (atleast before the most recent iteration) and red orchestra, or mods such as project reality and insurgency.",31.0

"this game has a lot of available game modes because of how many mods (mission files) people make. this game is diverse because of the modding community that the arma series has. while the game still needs more firearms to be implemented into it, i am sure the modding community will fix that issue. this game has been out for a couple years now and is doing strong. arma 2 had a strong following and i do hope that this will too. one downfall about this game that has been around since the alpha is that usb headsets are hit and miss. sometimes they have certain sounds cut out. the way i went around this issue is by selecting my optical out as my default instead of my usb headset (skullcandy plyr1). another downfall is the content. the game takes place the near future however the game does not include any current era firearms that are being used in any military force.",257.8

"first of all, arma is not a shooter like cod or bf. the pace, style of gameplay, maps, are really different, but i have to say that it is more enjoyable, funny, and communicating with the other players is great. for example, being the gunner of a tank: there are numbers that tell you direction and distance, so other player inside the tank tells you the indications to shoot. you wont be able to find this anywhere else. or being in a squad, splitting in pairs to clear some buildings while the other 2 players cover you. it is important to make clear that you buy arma for its multiplayer and coop mode. if you are looking for campaign game, dont buy this. also, if you are planning to buy this game, i have to tell you that you will have to join a clan to enjoy this game to its maximum; otherwise, by yourself, you wont like it as much :s joining a clan means you will have to download mods (content created by the community), and probably teamspeak (program similar to skype) to play with them (all clans ask for a mic, take that into account). to sum it up, arma is a total unique in the experience out in the market regarding fps. nonetheless, to have a good time you need to join a clan and play with other people, and be willing to download new content.",237.6

"such a beautiful game, excellent realism and tactical combat, you truly feel immersed in a real war.... however arma 3 has major failings, firstly it is poorly optimised, runs on only a couple of threads, meaning the newer your pc, the slower the game will run. the review pc was a piledriver 4.5ghz 8-core amd with a 680gtx card, ultra high settings the game had the same frame rate as low settings - averaging between 18 - 30fps, which was jerky but playable, until you got somewhere where a tank rolled in behind us and started shoooting, then everyone there was down to 3fps. people say there pc runs fine, but half the people i know who play are barely able to move and shoot, until arma 3 is fixed and written properly to support modern hardward, you should not buy this game. the developers have never managed to fix arma 2, i hold little hope they will fix arma 3!",38.1

"cant tell you if you should buy it or not, but i can tell you this. you will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have. but when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, its something magical you just cant find in any other game. arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. you buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. arma is a game which you can never called finished. there will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! ill give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back. read: i will not accept random friend requests! if you have a question, please post it in the comments.",919.3

"with clunky mechanics, a joke of a tutorial and god-like ai, this game is a waste. unless you just want it for the severly limited amount of accesible servers playing one of many different styles of missions (altis life, altis life, altis life, or altis life) i would advise steering clear of this game.",5.0

"after recently playing a lot of arma ii, mainly on the game modes island life and wasteland i decided that i absolutly must have this game, and when it went on sale this summer sale (2014) i snatched it up right away; and i can tell you i do not regret it a single bit! wasteland is a little different to what i was used to on arma ii after only playing it for a short while but fun nethertheless, zeus is where the game has really caught my attention! read up on zeus and give it a shot, you wont regret it if you want more depth to a shooter.",38.2
"used to not have a lot of guns but its constantly improving. its the most fun with friends but still a lot of fun alone. i would give it a 10/10 but because of the framerates and flying goats ill give it a solid 0/10",216.8

"arma 3 is clearly a step forward compared to arma 2. interesting new mechanics and more smoother gameplay compared to the previous game. but still, this game could be complete  because all the bugs and d-sync. but all of the creative people who have made many interesting mods and missions make this game such a masterpiece. i have spent so much time playing this game. the community of this game is the best i have seen so far. arma 3s playerbase is like one big family. but then there are the s, but they are kinda rare nowadays. this game has made me laugh and cry so many times because the bugs and some epic and stupid moments. the only bad thing i say about this game is that it is getting less realistic compared to arma 2. arma 2 has mods that make it a real mil-sim. this game is more like slow-paced open world bf with some realistic stuff. i rate this game 8/10.",889.4
"arma 3 is an awesome game to play with frinds whom take it seriusly. otherwise its no fun if you dont find a good server",599.4
"arma 3 is very much an improvement on the previous games and i enjoy the smoother combat and animations than arma 2s clunky movement but the optimization issues and bugs still remain although not as heavy as arma 2s. it can be a pain to get into games on public servers where everyone just acts like its your typical arcade shooter or the other side where everyone is being a pain by trying to keep it ultra serious and kicking everyone who doesnt say tango down or whatever every two seconds which is why i recommend finding a good group of people like shack tactical to play with. but hey you could just ignore it all and play wasteland or arma life servers and never play anything else which is the great thing about gaming. anyway hopefully this paints an alright picture in your mind about the game good luck and happy hunting!",87.6
"arma 3 does a good job at improving many aspects that were lacking in their previous versions. most notably, in my opinion, is the ability to dive underwater without dying. helicopter flight dynamics seem to have improved, although they are still not realistic. i would like to see vortex ring state (now implemented with helo dlc, thanks!), limited power during hot/heavy/high altitude operations, and a wider ability to slingload realistic loads (partially implemented in helo dlc, thanks bi!) into battle.",155.1
"this game...... is amazing! i love that you can choose whatever you want to do: go by helicopter and attack a radiotower? no problem! want to be sneaky and work your way arround to assasinate a target? no problem! it just has and so realistic feeling and that makes it super awesome! 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",48.0
"oh yes great game! so much more advanced than arma2 !",50.5
"love the game and most deffinately cant get enough of it, you have so much to do and in my opinion nothing to complain about.... its 100% perfecto! you have many campaign missions, showcase missions, scenearios which people create, multiplayer and you can even make your own mission. dont forget the all new zeus game master where you can spawn anything... and enter arsenals where you create the soldier, his loadout and be able to play as him! its truly my number one game........ thank you so much bohemia interactive!!!!!!!",463.8

"fantastic games with a good variety of community made missions/mods etc. if you were an avid arma 2 player, youll love arma 3! the only problem i could see with this game is that its quite diffrent from other shooter games, and maybe a little hard to get into without help from friends that have already been playing this or arma 2.",229.3

"arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation. where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community. you will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title. the game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like arma 2 for example. personally i used to be big on the battlefield series but once i started playing arma it was arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter. the depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing. everything fromt he graphics, to physics to sound effects are really good. oh and if you dont want to use the vanilla stuff, again theres mods, even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one. theres also a really fun multiplayer mode called zues, which is essentially dungeons and dragons meets first person modern day shooter. one player acts like the dm and the others play in his / her world. allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly. this one gets my whole hearted thumbs up. for information on how to mod your game, check out this youtube video:",828.3

"i think this is the beast game i have ever played just buy it now!!!!",48.1
"this is more like a military simulation than a fps type game. within one week of buying it i have amased over 100 hours of game time, its that addictive. whether its straight up shoot or be shot or rp you prefer arma 3 has it all. driving, flying or under water you become immersed in the life of a modern day military opereation. i love it.",773.8
"very fun time most of them on the kill of the hill game",64.5

"watched some streams and videos about altis life so even with the high price decided it looked fun. umm, yeah, the arma ui is all kinds of wonky. switched to single player campaign to learn it a bit better and it was pretty meh out the gate. lot of money for something that is everywhere for cheaper. probablly be alot more fun for me if i had a group or some like minded people to play with. /edit i still stand by the wonky controls but i have grown fond of some of the mods. king of the hill and some others are quite fun. i cant say i am that good at them but i have gotten better the more i play. for the money it still seems overpriced, but some good gameplay is to be had at times.",210.9

"amazing sand box game. dont come here expecting fast/arcade action like battlefield... this game is a marathon, not a sprint. single player is still plenty fun, multi-player is classic arma... the campaign is a mix of unfair vs. too easy depending on your loadout and how many saves you allow yourself. some modding is essential to get the best out of the game as well. if you like doing mission design, youll have a blast with the tools provided, but they are almost completely undocumented, so its pretty hard core getting started.",416.3

"this games definetly for people who like to be imaginative in the military action category. i like the tactical mechanics but i wish theyd change the fighting style of infantry when your a group leader. that problem makes the combat a little slow. other than that i am now in love with arma in general. the gameplay is a whole lot more fun than all these brand new fpss and it really throws you into the battle and isnt just point and shoot but brings it to a whole new playing level, making it feel that much more real. i have to say what makes the games a million times better is the modding community. there is never a single day where i am bored of playing this game, other than my inexperience with scripting in the editor, making it hard to look around and find solutions to my problems. i would seriously recommend this game for someone looking to have fun, sharpen their senses, or both.",556.1

"if you need a tactical, teamwork filled adrenaline rush then arma is the place to be. you need to spend a long time learning the recoil patterns and even the wind speed changes how your bullets fly through the air. this game is not for the call of duty or battlefield player who just likes to run and gun. there are lots of places to explore in the map because its so big but in a gamemode like domination or king of the hill, youll be deployed to one area only so it will be a close engagement in that place only. lots of workshop content to keep you busy after that campaign is over but the muiltiplayer is where its at. 9/10 - only for the hardcore military player who loves teamwork and long engagements.",89.8
"arma 3 is the modern combat simulation of 2013-2014. actually that was a lie. arma 3 is anything you want it to be. a first person shooter. a role playing game... arma 3 fits all genres. if you want something and have the means to make it. you can. all because of the new arma 3 engine. personaly i think arma 3 knocks battlefield & call of duty off the board. even if most people think the faces on arma 3 look like total crap compared to other shooters on the market. graphics dont matter, its the content of the game thats most important. plus arma 3 is open world. no scripts, no dumb game barriers, no seeing through walls crazy ais. everyones game expirence is different depending on their actions. i mean arma 3s maps like altis and stratis are just plain massive! i 100% reccomend buying this game regardless of the type of computer you have. well obviously you need to meet minimal requirements to even play the game. also people who have intel hd graphics mobile. you may face some difficulties. get ready to see real warfare.",230.5
"one of the best mil-sims / combat-sims ever made, definatly worth the $60",176.5
"for me this was in my list of one of those legendary releases of 2013, this is a perfect game for an open-sandbox reaslitic military shooter and has numerous gamemodes instead of just being the typical army type first-person shooter where you just do a mission shoot and its over. one thing is to make sure you have a great gaming rig because this is a very demanding game and is still going through some updates to increase optimization.",50.7
"as all arma games they are hard to figure out the controls but bieng the next step after the most realistic game in the world its understandable.arma three has greatly improved its campaign after arma 2s rather terrible one arma #s is actually worth playing.when it comes to multiplayer in a arma game there is nothing like it ranging from altis life(role play) to conquoring the whole vast 270 sq kilometers of altis.i would definately recommend this game to anyone that has a computer that can handle it.nomatter if you have the recommended requirements or not as you can imagine this game puts a load on computers.",273.6
"this game is a massive improvement to the series. both the visuals and the gameplay have received a complete makeover, while still being very recognisable to anyone familiar with the arma series. especially cqb is more fun now, with the reworked controls, stances and ballistics (barrier penetration). vehicles also received some attention, now with realstic physics. another nice addition is the underwater gameplay, it adds a whole new dimension to the game. contrary to its predecessors, the campaign has a very good storyline and is more immersive. at this moment, theres still less third party content available than for arma 2, but im sure this will improve over time.",196.9

"pretty dissapointed. to me, it doesnt live up to arma or arma 2. the campaign so far hasnt done anything for me, very repetitive, not much variety & i dont understand why theres been a month between each part of it. id rather much go back to a/a2 campaigns and replay them. i feel theyve been lazy in the lack of content for the single player side of things, not introducing any single player missions themselves like in arma or a2 & relying purely on the community for that aspect. for me, as much as i like playing online (through 2 very barren wastelands) i do like a good campaign to work through first and single player missions. id much rather play through the operation flashpoint franchise (bar red river & dragon rising because they were terrible.) as in my point of view for a war simulator they are still very much un-beatable",25.3

"this is a really good military simulation and i have to say. its really sitting on bf or any other silimar games face. this gives them a really big thumbs down if i may say. just as gran turismo is the real deal racing game, this is also the real deal combat game.",49.6

"if youre looking for a great game to give you some adrenaline, then arma 3 is the right choice for you. warning: this game involves massive team work on a large scale, if you like playing alone then this game may be too awesome for you. but other than that, work together to succeed! ( it is singleplayer, but i dont recommend playing alone ). war has never been accurate in a video game like it is in arma 3. instead of run & gun combat, you experience patient and heart pounding moments knowing the fact that if you die in a mission, its a game over. work with your friends to find advantage points to your enemys and call air support if a tank has you under fire. and if you get it in maybe the leg or arm, you can always bandage yourself to avoid bleeding to death. many missions usually last many hours so be sure to have nothing to do during the day and time in your hands. and if arma still feels like its missing something, visit",101.1

"if you have a beefy computer and looking to waste about 300+ hours of gaming then this game will meet your needs.",9.1
"this game is absolutely ridiculous in the fact that there is so much more to this game than shooting and killing. i was sick and tired of the neverending onslaught that is call of duty and battlefield. while i see both of those as fun in a fast paced competitive environment, i wanted to find a shooter that had more of a roleplay aspect to it. arma 3 is exactly what i was looking for. you cant just run out in the open and expect 360 across the map headshots while hipfiring with an smg (one the maps are huge and two bullet drop). cover can keep you alive while in a deadly firefight and can keep you alive while your buddy tries to save you with his gunship he stole from an enemy base. also, there is a free movement camera by holding the alt key which changes the fixed camera in typical first person shooters. you can be running into a forest while looking to your right and you might notice an enemy patrol and can drop to cover before they notice you. and then theres the mods. there are so many different mods to make the game sound and look better and modded game modes that add even further role play in the game. i spent about 80 hours in one week addicted to one of those game modes and ended up missing a few days of school because i was sucked in. this game is best when playing with friends!!!",191.1
"this is an amazing, war simulator that i would highly recomend to those who want to lead or follow from the front line in a group as large or as small as you want, take control and win. see you in game.",157.2
"i really like the game. it is really fun and almost all the way realistic. just sometimes when you fall like 5-10 feet you die. which is ridiculous iand stupid. i would rate this game a 8/10.",427.5
"this game is an incredibly realistic and tactical shooter, with the addition of the editor mode, this game becomes so much more. it has its bugs but still they are forgiveable, altis life and battle royal are extremely fun and addicting. a warning before you buy though; practise your skills in the editor before you move onto multiplayer, requires a fairly good pc, make sure you watch some tutorials and gameplay before buying since if you buy this game and find it wont run on your pc, or you some how simpley dont like the game $60 is a fair bit of a waste of money. overall i give arma iii 9/10. hope you found this review helpful!!! =p",584.2
"buy it on sale for $30 or less. game would be worth it in that case.",8.8
"lol i like how theres people who have hundreds of hours in it and leave it a bad review. this game is probably one of the best purchases ive made, i can always come back to it and have fun. the ammount of possibilities in the game is endless and for the most part has a great player base. your experience really depends on where/who you play with.. arma3 can either be a running simulator or a intense military simulator with moments you wont find in any other game. when you do happen to join an awesome server with coordinated people there is much fun to be had. buy it, dont look back.",388.4

"great game for realism, even more so if you have patience and friends to play with",47.5
"really worth buying. you can go ride go-karts, play battle royale with friends, play breaking point with friends, play wasteland with friends. the only problem with the game is when you dont have any friends that have this game to play with. 9/10 from me.",55.9
"this is one of the best military simulations i have ever played. the campaign is not bad, but you can download scenario missions which are user created missions. theyre incredibly easy to down load; you simply browse for a new scenario, subscribe to it, and you can play. its also easy to remove if youve completed it. this game has a huge replay value and youll never get bored. great job arma 3 devs!",197.7
"pretty awesome! loads of mods and sweet singleplayer plus battle royale or dayz, this game is easily worth the 60 you pay. with the immersive gameplay and treating it like real life you will feel and act like it is war and thats what sold me on this unique game. now if they could have put it on sale before i bought it that would have been nice!",10.7
"you are kidding me right? you are selling the completed version of the game that should have been released in the first place for $20 more have you idiots fallen out of your tree? it was my understanding that you sold the other version because you couldnt finish the single player campaign in time for your release date. things you need to address you need to work on your multiplayer experience we your customers love and support you guys cause you have a great lineage but dont piss down our backs and tell us its raining!!! please, move from the same gamespy technology that you have been using for over 20-years old and get something more updated also spend a little money on the community by getting us some local servers that we your customers can use here in the states without a damn 100 plus ping!!! get your in game comms together to optimize bandwidth. the sounds in arma 3 are still a little campy i know you dont want to have to pay for a sound engineer to actually do some sound mapping from real guns but guess what this is a real gun sort of experience so suck it up and get it done! we are your customer not some blind village idoit you can simply pick pocket when you want more money so dont treat us like one! regards, tat",223.2

"this is probaly one of the best games out there, you can really do whatever. mods, roleplay, missions, roaming, campaign anything really. it seriously worth buying!",50.6
"the game arma 3 is a superb sandbox military simulator. it has a campaign that showcases the game its self then it has individual showcases for elements inside the sandbox. it has an included editor for creating mission and mp missions. mods are very welcome element to this community. i have played altis life on the asylum server. this modification is a gta type atmosphere with lots to do. it has cops, civ, medic roles. housiong perm gangs and the like. i suppose i should mention some of the bad. the game can give frustration from time to time with hacking and game crashes. as unfortunate as it is it does exist. i had to spend a couple of days figuring out stop working errors. the game does get regular updates which help as well. also if you have a subpar rig this game can put some stress on your hardware. i get anywhere beteen 34-63 fps but some will have talked of worse fps thatn this. overall i reccomend this game just based on what is trying to be done here. this is a huge undertaking and very few games have the scope of this game with the and open sandbox experince.",339.0

"this is the most buggy game i have ever played in my life. i had all settings turned down to low so that i could work my way up to see what settings i could use comfortably but once i turned shadows on all the characters and guns went multicoloured and it put the fps down from 60fps to 1fps.",10.7
"its arma and thats what ruins this game. well ruin might be a strong word actually but thats not the point. the point is; whilst arma 3 is an enjoyable exeperience with its fancy guns and new physics, it really doesnt do anything to improve upon arma 2. i mean, theres plenty of new content and nice new graphics but it doesnt feel like much of an improvement in the way the game works. while i dont mind the action menu system i can see how it could be considered counter intuitive and that is the problem. the game has a learning curve that can make it difficult to enjoy and while i dont like games being dumbed down, i do enjoy them being made more accessible. the system used in arma is what puts a lot of players off and i dont think its particularly justifiable, as soon as bohemia change this they will see an increase in the playerbase. after that messy blab about the games system i do want to say i still wholeheartedly recommend the game, its great fun and worth a play.",16.3

"i recommend this game. im a noob but one thing i know is im better than all of you# joking# lol#by",7.6
"ive just started playing arma 3, and ive just played out the whole bootcamp, so i now know the basics. i think that its a extremely fun game, even though i havent tried out the multiplayer yet, but from what ive seen from gameplays i think it will be great! for those who want totry some real combat secenarios outside the bootcamp (beggnienrs) i would really recommend scuba, which was a exremely fun gaming experience. note thogh that i havent played all the showcases yet.",10.6
"if you want a challenging game, with a great community and a stupidly fun editor then buy this game",75.8
"you know those games where there are a few missions that make you throw your keyboard at a wall and say: what the crap that was !? well this is one of those games. the single player is very uneven, where some missions are easy and others are unbelievably hard. however, this is not a drawback, i keep coming back to this game even after i tell myself: im never playing this again, and when you finally pass that missions that youre stuck on, the satisfaction is incredible.",20.7
"this game is amazing i have seen gamplay i would recemend it to eny one that likes war games. this game is nice to play with friends. if i could get the money i would buy this but i dont have eny :( sadly",4.6
"i think this game is fantastic, and is the best standalone milsim available, but im giving it a negative review only because its poorly optomized and im getting 20 frames on a gtx 770 on all low settings. this only happens on multiplayer, so if youre only looking for the single player experience (you madman) definitely buy this, otherwise, only buy this if you have the pc to back up this games inabilaty to run well. ive played better looking games in 4k resolutions and gotten better frames than this.",23.6
"yes i would recommend this to a friend, but only if we could play together because alone it isnt that great.",6.5
"i really like this game so far! the optimization really kind of sucks, but there are plenty of guides out there to help you out. definitely pick this game up if youre up for a fun shooter. my only big complaint is that i bought this game for full price, and then it was on sale for 50% off the week after :(",31.7
"to have fun in this game you must work with your teammates. communication makes this game fun (or funny, youll meet great guys on this game). going somewhere alone if the most boring expierence youll have. get to that city with all your teammates and find a town to take over, plan your assault then execute. you might be able to get some good mods on this game too (battle royale, breaking point) that will only expand your game expierence. when you first start off your frames will be absolute crap, google stuff to find fixes, you just have to change some stuff in your game files. stick to certain servers too. they may be the only ones with good frames/those cool guys you were playing with earlier. all in all you gotta trust my review because i only write long reviews for games im passionate about. single player: creates that epic feel that multiplayer has, with a story. 8/10, a little clunky multi-player: epic stuff. great community. you can let that tactical guy out of you that says tango or hostile instead of enemy. 10/10 mod support, in-depth video settings. overall: 9/10 game. does not deserve to sit in your library and rot.",148.1
"i love milk but i did not love how much less content this game had so good day to you and i am not a good pooper",16.3
"i recommend this game to ppl who like real life war simulators but wat i dont understand is if arma 3 is so realistic in ways like the bullet can penetrate walls.. why is there no wounding system like dragging the injured and carrying them, in the game like the wants they had in arma 2..",103.7
"this game looks gorgeous on ultra settings and is great for benchmarking, this game requires a hefty rig to run stable 60fps 1080p which is a big factor on whether you take a risk on purchasing the game if you have a low end system, the multiplayer is very cpu intensive and could lead to unexpected drops of frames even on the most beefy of pcs. this game however is packed with singleplayer content and a large variety of multiplayer modes, the game also features a mission editor so you can make your own missions or download them off the steam workshop. with the peformance issues in mind this still is an amzing game and is worth a fullprice purchase if you have friends which can play with you on it. 9/10 great game but low-medium end rigs or even pcs with a not great cpu be weary.",121.2

"arma 3 is a great game. whilst there are still some bugs and glitches it is well worth the purchase. this is the only game where you spend an hour getting to the enemy only to have a 20 second gun battle, yet still enjoy it. this is nothing like battlefield or cod. unlike those games, every single kill that you make gives you great satisfaction and, since it takes so long to get to the battle, you value your life much more than you do in battlefield or cod. this game does have quite a steep learning curve and you will need a full keyboard, but after a few hours, you will really begin to enjoy playing this game. also, arma 3 is not only a military sandbox, it is also the best go-kart simulator!",276.6
"u can buy dayz u can buy payday 2 or u can buy something like that price or u can buy arma 3 and play wasteland with your friends or solo u can single u can play dayz mod or if u want to real life go play it arma 3 has it too nah im interesting with something else if u are saying arma 3ll have it mode buy it mate...",88.2

"this game... is 10/10, its super fun and their is so much to do, epoch, breaking point, arma 3 life, altis life, anything you want. and then not to mention but all the workshop stuff you can do. it is without a doubt worth $60",568.5
"arma 3 is by far one of the best or even the best game i have played in my entire life. not only is the engine fantastic but the graphics are out of this world. the campaign was written in the most euphoric way possible and the amount of fun to be had on multiplayer is endless. also the mods which are out for arma 3 are great compared to other games. my favourite aspect about arma 3 is how it is so diverse that every type of gamer will find something they love. 6 stars!",287.6
"arma 3. one of the games that is just so hard to review because of the many different ways you can go about it. lets just say, i recommend it if you like 30 fps even with a mid to high end pcs. very heavy on cpu and not very well optimised, but its arma. what you get is huge maps. love it.",293.2
"very good game. the campaign missions are less resemblent of what a military, simulation shooter should be compared to arma 2. its only worth playing to get a hold of the controls. arma is best within its coop, multiplayer, and mods. my largest complaint would be the difficult interface. theres too much reliance on the cursor and it gets annoying.",22.0
"a good game with a big community adding so much more to this game. 8/8",449.6
"bought it in alpha for wasteland after enjoying it so much in arma 2. not too much was added when it went through beta and final release. now with zeus, battle royale and a lot of other addons and mods coming it, there is too many reasons to list to buy and play this game. ive easily sunken another good day off from work just playing zeus with my clan.",370.6

"1-10 because i purchased it. i bought it in alpha hoping that a full game would be released but it still has not. campaign is a joke, because there are player made campaigns that are 10x harder and more complex. multiplayer server hosting does not work 7 times out of 10. there is virtually no effort by bohemia to release content, it would be very easy for them to release all arma 2 content for arma 3, the community has done it but its damn straight  to get it to work and it barly does even when you get it too. there are virtually no weapons in the game. all the good features for arma 3 are made by the players. they have released less content than one dlc of anygame. just goes to show europoors dont make good games. 1-10 would not buy if on sale for 5$. asked bohemia for my money back and they do not respond and you are not allowed to post on their forums.  tier company is  tier. this is a huge disapointment from arma 2 content wise. anyone who gives a good review didnt play arma 2. or has the expectations of a cawadooty game.",586.7
"amazing game. very realistic and perfect if youre a fan of the military and military tactics. the game offers limitless gameplay due to the fact that there are so many missions and scenarios created by the community. for some odd reason i get 90 fps on very high in singleplayer, but whenever i play multiplayer, even if nothings going on, it just drops to 30. also keep in mind that this is a huge game. i am fortunate to have built a gaming pc, but if your computer isnt that great, consider upgrading or just dont get this game.",55.7
"i became an apple picker and a cannabis druglord in less than an hour 10/10",41.3
"one of my favourite games at the moment. a first person shooter that focuses on military tactical combat. the multiplayer is what really shines, with impressive mods that range from battle royale to nato patrol ops, theres something to appease pvp and pve players alike. love mowing down enemy players? theres an abundance of interesting pvp modes. prefer co-operative missions against ai enemies? theres an abundance of modes for you as well. and if youre like me and enjoy a mix of both then all the better! arma 3 has a friendly and intelligent community too, i myself have made a crazy amount of friends on it. and with the variety given by mods and maps, there is a ridiculous amount to do and play on here. highly recommended.",353.7

"love this game! has a good gameplay with a good graphic,really worthed!",207.7
"arma 3 is a good successor to arma2 with some great improvements to the engine, visuals, vehicles etc. mainly i have played the wasteland, king of the hill and epoch (alpha) mods. king of the hill being the most rewarding and enjoyable over all. i have only just dipped my toes into the campaign, however i will be doing more of it i think. with all the improvements to arma, youll still get those good ole arma moments like clipping through walls/floors, and your vehicle exploding on contact with a weed or bush.",989.6
"this game is one of the most, if not the most realistic shooter game i have played. the multiplayer is a definate must especially if you can find a semi serious server where people work together to complete objectives. all in all this game is very enjoyable and the community is great!",54.3
"ratings: graphics: 9/10 sound: 9/10 content: 5/10 singleplayer: 7/10 multiplayer: 9/10 workshop: 10/10 diversity: 8/10 arma 3 is a great military simulation, that lets you feel how war could feel like. not seeing your enemy but getting shot at is almost everyday business, like it is if you are deployed in real life war zones. the game mechanics are far more advanced than in arma 2, however, the game still lacks content. although arma 2 didnt have content at the beginning, it still bothers myself a little bit. the sound and graphical elements are magnificient and the world offers a lot of nice landscapes. however i would recommend playing it as a multiplayer game, if you can try to play with some friends. i hope i could help you with my review. please note that this is my personal view, i will upgrade this review if further content is added lateron.",88.8
"good game, actually very good game not recommended for gamers with bad graphics cards, highly recommended for gamers who do have one. it is hard to get a grasp of the controls at first but as you play you learn the controls.",7.2
"quickly became one of my favorites. i didnt like arma ii much, because the infantry gameplay is kinda sucked. but arma iii has seem to pull it all off quite well with the new terrain, weapons and mechanics, while vehicle gameplay are still thoroughly enjoyable. the is definitely a must have for both military-enthusiasts and fps-genre gamers.",194.1
"this game was a load of epicness.very intense battles with loads of non-stop action packed fun!",170.6
"really good game but frames are ing terrible! they lock at around 30 to 45 until you get into combat then they drop to anywhere from ing 5 to 15 its ridicoulus!",100.7

"for only $15.99 you can unlock a helicopter in a game you already paid for. 10/10 would buy all dlc",2.2
"this is the best fp(tactical)s by far, i dont think there is any real competition out there. unlike most other fpss, this gem of a game has longevity. yes you have a campaign mode and other singleplayer/multiplayer scenarios {made by an ever growing army of fans} which you can download from the arma iii workshop but you also get to create your own missions in the mission editor/creator, i dont think there are many(if any) other fpss that offer that much depth in their games.",102.9
"it is awesome. it has a fun storyline as well as single player. multiplayer is a great to. i highly recomend it.",356.8
"true military simulator. it includes nearly everything that would be in an amazing military sim. there are so many things that i cant list them all, but ill do my best: pros -open world -realistic fatigue & gun movement (can be a con) -coriolis effect -realistic flight -realistic driving -realistic damage -realistic exposions & radious - if someone dies in your squad it can impact the game greatly -unlike many other military games, if something goes wrong in arma, you have to improvise, and you usually have to improvise fast, instead of going back to a checkpoint -no checkpoints -moddable -world/map editor to make your own levels or to just expirement and have fun cons -figuring everything out can be a hassle, and ive played over 70 hours and still havent figure out everything -the world can look untexturized and people are sometimes halfway in the ground when looking through a sniper rifle scope -can be a bit clunky at times while working in the world editor so overall, arma 3 is amazing and you should stop reading this review & buy it immediaty like, right now immediatly",73.4
"i played this game in alpha, spawn - airstrike - die - repeat, very unenjoyable. since playing the official release it has been great! i am now able to aim my sights at someone else, pull the trigger and they die, the vehicles are very entertaining aswell. thus making it an enjoyable game now. the campaign or champaign as i like to call it has some delicious variety of cypriut, english and american voice actors who truly went balls deep with their vocal skills. perhaps i should mention what the actual gameplay is like? no, its truly an experience only your hard earned cash can understand, i strongly urge you to consider spending some of your birthday money or stripper money on this simulation (game) and experience the story of a lifetime. you cannot possible fathom the scale of the maps that are at hand, it will litterally take you hours to run from one side to the other in real time. i highly recommend this game if you wish to waste countless hours of your life pretending to be in the military.",74.3
"arma 3 isnt for everyone, but if you love milsims then this game does its job right",26.7
"cant tell you if you should buy it or not, but i can tell you this. you will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have. but when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, its something magical you just cant find in any other game. arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. you buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. arma is a game which you can never called finished. there will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! ill give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back. read: i will not accept random friend requests! if you have a question, please post it in the comments.",919.3
"so here is a military sim. it is a a very fun military sim. i have sat down and played most of the campaign, which had been enjoyable. a majority of my time has been put towards the mulitiplayer. the game has very many options and mods to play when it comes to multiplayer, some of them being breaking point, wasteland and king of the hill. all of them are great fun and i have had to at least sink about 15 hours in each. if you are looking for something that is fun to play with a group of friends and is a military sim, then this is a game for you. i would give this about 3.5/5. just because it still does have some bugs but would gladly say that this has the potential to be a 5/5 game once a lot of those issues are ironed out.",65.3
"wasteland is great fun with friends and the game is very pretty, map could use some more development but other than that its an all round fun experience. i would not recomend this game to anyone with sub-standard hardware as this is no fun with anything less than 40 fps.",183.0
"best first person shooter ever made. it has the best detail along with gameplay. even though its still in beta i think its still a 5 star game. the developers really put some thought into this game you have the best graphics especialy if your computer can handle ultra. now for some gameplay i really like wasteland if you get this game grab some friends and play some wasteland.",151.7
"never buy this game. might be a great game, as all the other arma games were, but battleye likes to randomly ban people so you cant play anymore. i spent at least $80 on all my arma games, and dayz standalone, and because i never played them for a while, i one day get on and i find out that i was perminantly banned from all servers. even after contacting battleye support and bohemia interactive support they both they they cant do anything, even though battleye told me that bi could give me a new copy, and they just deny it. these people just want to steal your money and let you never play the game again.",41.3
"the mods for this game are what define it. altis life, king of the hill, breaking point, wasteland are all great games in their own right.",55.7
"great game! really fun to play with friends only just started playing but by god i have had a lot of fun. some of this includes getting bombed by jets, grenades and even choppers. the people on it are very social as well you can talk to team mates to get through small tasks. although this game does require good specs to get the best out of the game.",63.5
"this game was good it is kida oviece its a army simulation",0.5
"severly clunky animations, appallingly bad gunplay and still buggy months after release, will never buy another game from this company that expects the modding community to produce content for them. it makes me sick that i actually spent money on this utter trash. so poorly optomized it runs under 60fps on a fairly high end system that runs bf4 on ultra at over 80fps.",443.3
"havent really played the single player but a bit and it seems good. multiplayer is very fun like arma 2. arma 3 is a good sequel to arma 2 and i dont know why people say it lags a lot, maybe because they dont have good pcs and the game has really good graphics. dont play the game if you like fast action movie gameplay like cod. cause this game is all about patience.i reccomend playing king of the hill in mp in the beginning because its one of better gamemodes!",66.6
"quite fun! graphics are great and runs very well. weapons and vehicles are amazing! 9/10",1.8
"i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have diversity from being able to play a milsim to somebody who wants to mod the living daylights out it, there are many mods that subtle changes to the drastic changes like the dayz mod. i think it has the variety to be able to keep any player attracted the arma series for a long time.",113.5
"complete trash of a game. every single problem from arma 2 (which is a lot) is still there. do not buy this game. everything from the controls to the camera to the instructions is useless and made by monkeys. if you fly a heli the slightest turn of the mouse and your camera spins 180 degrees and you can see everything but what you want. waypoints are still in the dumbest colour ever so you can never see where you are going. such a shame as it looks amazing and has so much detail but you need to deal with so much frustration and just utterly poor game design. i wish you could get a refund cos this game is an outrage.",14.7
"much better than that of the 2nd one, less glitched a very polished look that really adds to the atmosphere.",256.4

"fun game and the breaking point mod is much better than dayz",53.3
"complete game, looking nice, the maps are just incredibly large, a nice change of pace of modern shooters where your patience and camouflage will save your life. this is also the only game that get my hearts beating once the action is going on. very intense. multiplayer optimisation not quite there sadly",113.2
"i am new in arma 3 game just two days later and the problem appeared [battleye: global ban # 4648c2] i swear i have not used fraud i bought a digital widowed with a full dlc im not i do not know what to do",17.4
"before playing this game you should ask yourself - what military operation would you like to play? do you want to be a sniper? do you want to be a part in a big combined arms operations? do you want to ride a tank? helicopter? kart? do you want to be a civilian and simply role-play your wild dreams? do you want to play as a god? really, there is not much to be said about arma that has not been said - yes, there are bugs, yes it is still a bit laggy, but it gets better. and it will get better because developers still update game and listen to fans feedback. you can have hundreds of mods, do whatever you want to do or simply follow missions. it is all up to you. this is main difference between other military shooters - it is a sandbox concept, which means you are buying lot of games in one.",596.4
"this game, it might sometimes be glitchy and bugs might arise everywhere and you might look dead when your really not, but it really does come down to how epic this game can get, full scale tank battles with air support and noobies everywhere with overpowered rocket launchers... thats my vision how of epic this game can get. but thats how i like it, you make it what ever you want. being a sandbox only limit is no nukes, ;d but that would be way overpowered, just imagine n00bies setting off like 100 nukes.. i dont think anybody would enjoy that. :l 10/10",218.0

"unlimited free content. fully modifiable. realistic ballistics. tons of weapons, air land and sea vehicles. massive maps. the only shooter you will ever need. buy it.",688.5
"amazing game! if youre looking for something actually tactical and team based, not just the mindless run and gun arcade shooters like cod or bf4, then this is your game. the game also has many mods and different game modes you can experience, many similar to those from arma 2",278.1
"this game is by far one of the best tactical shooters i have ever played. i love the maps and the way the game feels in the way of how the weapons work, the movement, and the flow of the game just feel amazing.",739.5
"its just amazing episaly with mods but the base game is amzing as it is the only one i botherd to complete plus the editor is really good for creating missions",50.4
"great game, really gets you addicted, worth the money(check out , for cheaper price). still a bit buggy, and need some tweaks. but nothing major. youll need a good computer, but with the recent multiplayer updates, im getting better fps at this then arma 2.",259.6
"this is a must buy, amazing graphics, surprising fps, a ton better than arma 2, and even more amazing mods to be played, inlcuding the new zombie mod breaking point which is crazy fun.",150.2
"this game is hard. you jump out of a building-splat-dead. you are walking aroung- bang-dead. you are in a tank-mine explodes-dead. however,once you learn all of the tricks(about 75 hours for me) it starts to get really rewarding. this game is very immersive from the fact that you can shoot enemies from over 2 klicks, you can fly helicopters, fixed wing, and drones. you can drive tons of vehicles, or you can just walk around as a rifleman. use the mission editor to create a mission to your liking, download mods to (nearly) perfect your game. a.i. is kinda glitchy, some textures arent perfect but overall, fantastic game. seriously, one of my friends needs to buy this so we can play together.",229.5
"arma 3 is my most favorite game ever because of its great possibilitys. ofcourse it wont even come close to a real life experience but thats impossible. but in my opinion the devs really screwed it right now cause i need to re-add al my mods/addons to the game one by one and thats a little to much since i use over 200 different mods they shouldnt have changed the way to add en use new addons via the addon maps in the game directory cause the launcher is bad. im dutch sorry for my grammer i dont give a damn because i think everyone will understand im no grammer-nazi i recommand this game to everyone that likes a difficult realistic army simulator. lextig.",1016.0
"this game is completed. has everything to have alot of fun. recommend to every human been.",155.6

"it make me want to be a solider. it is a really good game if you can do an editor you can play it all day. so realistic .",18.6
"i love all the different mods that are made for this game, everyone you load up is a completely new experience allowing for hours of gameplay without getting bored. however this game is not fast paced like bf4 and cod, so it takes alot more tactics, and works best when you have a group of people to work with.",448.8
"i will admit a fun game, but do not buy now! now for $60 and a lack of content this game does not deserve the cash. especially since their already coming out with these dlc. wait for the price to drop or for more things to be added. in addition you better have a beast computer",181.7
"edit: bohemia has been releasing constant updates and stability patches. the game is getting better - but my previous comment stands. i can not justify to anyone who has not played it before at this price. this is a game to pick up on a steam sale & its dlc. my recommendation - do not purchase it until then.",11.1
"this is by far the bast arma game i have play what next for arma who know but i recommend this to all my friend",223.4
"from what i played of it i had a ton of fun especially in the multiplayer, it was all out chaos and i couldnt stop laughing i had a cop strip down and run into the ocean while firing his gun in the air and then someone drove their truck into the water and killed him. 1510 -ign",1.8
"pros: better graphics better controls better sound cons: same laggy multiplayer as arma 2 same terrible interaction system still using outdated arma 2 mod tools (all mods are just ports) most vehicles and weapons are the same between factions, just different textures still uses 2004 netcode its trying to be more casual as of right now, i do not feel as if this game is worth the $60, it still plays like its in alpha. unless they release proper mod tools, i would not buy until it drops atleast 50% in price.",291.7
"man where can i start. this game has made me forget any other game out there (including bf4)...so many options and possibilities. after surviving a really intense firefight our squad made it out alive. we requested to be picked up and the nearest vehicle was a m939 truck i believe. we replenished our ammo and equipment and on our way to the next target our driver fell asleep and we all got killed in the crash...good times. warning: if you do not want to spend hours and hours playing do not buy.",151.7
"from the guys that brought you that game with the takistanis comes a sequal in which comma usage is practically zero. the game now features less  factions such as csat and nba 2k12 oh and did i forget to mention now you can aim your rifle properly. all in if it i had to chose between rescuing an already redeemed arma cd key on a sheet of paper and my best friend from falling off a cliff in iowa.... dont know how the cliff got there, but i would chose the arma key because armsma is mein leibe armsma ist meine leute ich bin auto",437.9
"a definite upgrade from arma ii, the controls act more like pc controls of the 21st century (not feeling like your wading through pudding when trying to look, strafe, etc.) and the graphics of course are much improved. there have been some issues with physx crashes, but only from those with amd cards in my experience. sa-matra wasteland alone is reason enough to pick this up! the only gripe i really have is that they still have not made the client/server multi-threaded. one of the most idiotic things to overlook when the ai calculations and such really make this game/engine heavily cpu-intensive. if you love realistic shooters without all the kill-streak b.s. and handicapping, pick this game up.",547.3
"the game needs some polishing, but when it is done i think the result will be damn good :) worth a buy",140.8

"great game. many mods, worth. but the low fps kinda sucks.",105.4
"best war simulator ever! fans of arma 2, if you are fan of modern, not futuristic combat, you can still enjoy this game! with the arsenal of mods coming to it at the moment, it will soon go back from 2035 to 2014. still, the vanilla game is great too. the first 2 campaign episodes are great but the third one lacks of depth. i strongly recommend it to experienced arma fans. (please kids, dont buy this and infect our gameplay! this game is made for mature war sim fans.)",679.0
"just another arma. same bugs (with a bunch of new ones), same gameplay, same problems, same game. absolutely worth buying for anyone who fell in love with tactical shooters (any of the ofp, arma series or bf2: project reality). and not recommended to anyone else.",77.7

"im going to make my review as short as possible. arm is a monster of a game, and a damn good one to. if you are not willing to put time into the controls and gameplay you will be bored and frustrated quickly. from what i have found, the community is very mature, the servers are good and the gameplay is suspenseful. we have not seen any game like this in a long time, there is an insane amount of content, the graphics are amazing, and the feeling is absolutely pinpoint what it is meant to be. i coudnt recomend this more to the people who are interested in the idea 9/10",67.1

"the greatest accomplishment a game can have is to leave lasting memory with the player. i find that this is especially true for memories that you can share. arma 3 can provide these in abundance. it is easily one of the best sandbox games i have ever played. ill never forget escaping from a temporary prison with a handful of friends, spending hours slowly and stealthily making our way to a heavily guarded communication tower, taking out an entire platoon in a surprise attack, and finally making contact with friendly forces for extraction, only to be told to rendezvous on the opposite side of the island. of course, the enjoyment of these games is also dependent on the people that you play it with, so be sure to pester all your good friends so that they can play this with you. for as graphics and physics heavy as this game is, it handles surprisingly well. gameplay wise, you will have to relearn everything youve been taught for fpss. if youre not extremely careful and working as a team, youre going to die swiftly and painfully. the number of player made missions is amazing. this game has a bit of a learning curve, but not nearly as much as the previous titles in the series. please, if you want to have some fun with friends, get this game.",31.1
"best game ever played! is the best real life shooter game you can have!",277.3

"brilliant game if your in the market for mil-sim where you arnt a bullet eating machine like in cod. easy to learn the basics but a very steep learning curve to master. a brilliant mission editor gives this game endless replyability. (better with friends)",57.8

"feels like i wasted my money. game looks beautiful, but it got too frustrating when it felt like everyone else was going on with the mission and combat, and i was left looking around for the enemy. outisde of waiting for some tracers to show up and give the enemy away, my efforts to eliminate my target were futile 99% of the time. id use up all my ammunition, and theyd land in a perfect shot, every single time. it got to the point that i would end up sitting back while the ai on my team took care of it- after all, they knew exactly what to do while im just sitting there shrugging my shoulders. this is not your typical combat fps. the controle are wonky, and i spent a hard-earned $60 on frustration. i have a titan video card. it runs all of my games on maximum settings flawlessly. with arma 3, it seems like all i do to ajust the graphics settings makes no difference, as im hit with major framerate issues. after a few days, i reinstalled the game to give it another chance, but i just couldnt get anything accomplished. i personally dont recommend the game.",1.0

"i want to recommend, and enjoy, this game, but i dont. because it is very buggy and feels poorly scripted. sometimes something as fundamental as interacting with the world, car doors, ammo crates etc. can be really awkward. this can abruptly lead to your untimely, poorly justified, demise. or if youre really unlucky youll lay around unconcious for 5 minutes prior to dying! :) i cant forgive the devs or the bugs in this game like a lot of people can. it has been this way since arma 1 - which i never played but understood it was unplayable. arma 2 which i did play and found unplayable. after two games, i find arma 3 to be barely playable. i figure by now they ought to know what they are doing and how to achieve a desired result. niche game. im sure theres a reason so many people love it. i honestly feel as though im not patient enough to both play a simulator game, and babysit the flaws of said game in order to get something out of it. i havent exactly got a hardon for military games like others do either so bare in mind that your phallus may differ. i would definitely change my review to recommend and play this game if it were just.. less buggy, more playable.. it really doesnt matter if you add gokarts or dragons at this point, just improve the game.",12.9
"absalutly brilliant il give it ***** stars hope i get the full game soon i would sugest more classes it is fun with them but mabe something like a spy with a knife amd suppresd pistol (any just if it can have a suppresor ) and maby a juggernaught with duble health and a lmg brilliant if u can get this on the fulll game",3.2

"if you play alone, i would wait to a steam-sale came, but with friends its totaly worth buying now! cool stuff in arma is altis life and king of the hill. really good games in arma. you can download battle royale (mod) too. the campain is what it is. not really good, but good enough. would like if you could drive more armored vehicles, and the save system i dont like ether, i should be a autosave that dont delete its self when a new autosave come. like i got pretty far one time, and a auto save came and i died 2sec after the autosave came. so i died every time i respawned. so i had to start over again... campain: 6/10 cool, but need more vehicles (with gun on) multiplayer: 8/10 good enough to buy it graphics: 8/10 my pc can handle ultra graphics, and the nature looks amazing, but something here and there is missing",281.2

"excellent game if you have a half decent pc. people whinge about not much content but i found there is plenty for everything that i need and i believe most people need. if more content is needed, there are plenty to choose from. some of the mods such as breaking point (a zombie game on altis) are far superior to the dayz sa and most dayz for arma mods without the building as yet. i am sure that sa will get better but with patches few and far between it will take some time. arma 3 multiplayer is also very enjoyable with some mates and a few beers. certainly worth it if your into a bit of realism compared to other aa or aaa titles. be patient with the game, the end result is awesome all around.",781.7
"arma iii helicopters while exiting a helicopter it hit me and i died. i tried again and my parachute didnt deploy. i tried again and i died from hitting the air hard enough(wtf) arma iii ground vehicles my tank hit a fence and broke down. my truck did a flip on a 1 cm high pebble and crushed me. a quad bike nipped the back of my truck which caused it to explode as if it was hit by a rocket. arma iii pvp people go under the ground and shoot you. you get fatigued from walking 2 metres but a red dot sight will cure that for you somehow. you swap kills a lot because of lag. arma iii graphics graphics can be good but high end computers lag. arma iii fun doesnt exist.",11.0
"this is a really good military simulation and i have to say. its really sitting on bf or any other silimar games face. this gives them a really big thumbs down if i may say. just as gran turismo is the real deal racing game, this is also the real deal combat game.",49.6

"so much do i recommend this game. the gunfights are difficult and a few bullets are all it takes to kill. the whole game is gorgeous, just fantastic. i was worried the map would be bland considering it all looks brown but the campaign takes you to some of the the prettiest places in any game ive ever played.",152.3
"incredible game, the definitive military simulator",279.6
"an lovely game, my pc cant run it really good, but it is playable and i enjoy it a lot i already played since alpha and like wasteland in alpha nothing worked only the killing part and then weapons part but now its is so mutch better, the food and the drink works everything is fun, big map etc. sadly i got an really bad pc so it doesnt run withouth lag, but it is playable and a lot of fun :d",45.5
"always low on ammo. navigation is horrible. land mines everywhere. blown up every 4-5 minutes. wish i hadnt wasted my money.",4.6
"the engine overhaul has been a long time coming, and there are things to love about it, but unfortunately, compared to arma 2s tight engine (albeit a bit blocky), arma iii looks plain goofy. players run around like cartoon characters, hit detections are horrendus, and the weapons and vehicles are bland and boring. speaking of items, i understand bohemias intiative to make arma iii a near-future military simulator, but these weapons and vehicles are very bad. customizations seemed promising until you realize there are only a handful of base guns, none of which will come off as familiar. the main island is much larger than any other armas setting, but it still leaves much to be desired in the department of freshness and diversity. all in all, if you are a fan of arma ii and its engine, arma iii will feel pretty alien to you. either youll get used to it, or itll always keep you from really enjoying the game. i pre-purchased the alpha on day one, and im still struggling to enjoy it to this day.",105.8

"if your looking for a military sim, then this is the game you want. the core of the game is simply unbelievable. simply a awesome game.",39.6
"incredible graphics and amazing gameplay, thats arma in a nutshell. this time they have hit the mark, and by that i mean presenting a game that can utilize the best in the latest hardware. for me its the i7 2011 pin with a gtx 660ti, on a asus rog rampage-iv formula. i dont recommend using anything less than a decent gaming rig for this one, it doesnt need to be the best but pay attention to the graphic demand and ensure you use a good card. im absolutely hooked on this new direction that bohemia interactive have taken, all the traditional game play is still present as well as many new twists, a nicely built mission editor and of course, that very impressive scenery. my only gripe, and its not really relevant here, is that this game could really use clickable cockpits and vehicle controls, imagine having the best in eye-candy and adding a real sim feel to it,,, hinnnt to the moders :) buy this one, dont even bother dwelling on it folks, its a must have even for the offline players.",19.9
"i have almost 600 hours on this game its one of my all time favorite war simulators out there mainly because of altis life and the so many other things you can do on it.",551.9

"i was a fan of the arma series. i really played arma ii totally grey.. but i had high hopes for arma iii buying the alpha , promising us more stuff will be added later... yes that part is true.. arma iii on itself is totally empty... you have to get mods and payable dlc content to make the game interesting... it is like they gave you the engine of the car only.. you have to pay for the wheels , chassis , doors , windows , lights yourself. it is suppose to be milsim , in order to have that label , it should give us also. what made me being so disappointed about arma iii... it is that the helicopter dlc costs 12 euro.. like wtf",96.3
"really great game! much realistic, very deaths. but seriously! this game is the most realistic fps! it only takes a few shot to die. you definitely are not arnold schwarzneger (terminator), sylvester (rambo) or daniel craig (james bond). it has very hard singleplayer missions. maybe its because i usually act like terminator and try to run in everyones face with my assault rifle... dunno.. feels realistic.",22.6
"heading the same way as ea. dlc hungry company. its horrible thing to exclude things from a game to later include in a dlc, but then remove stuff from an already launched to put into a dlc....you guys have lost sight of putting out a game for people to just enjoy. money talks to you now.",360.7

"this fps is quite unique. instead of only pewpewpew or team fight, this game provides a *real* battlefield, not like dices battlefield series.i wont call it a game but a military simulation software.and theres plenty of mods in this game, so its very playable. one of my friend played this game for 60hrs in 2 weeks.since this game is for the hardcore players, so it wouldnt be very friendly to newcomers. best military simulator ever.10/10. also btw, dont think you can play this game with it told you the minimal system requirement of 8800gt. my gtx460 still sucks for almost half of time.",6.4

"an infinite playground. feel like some competition play? boot up multiplayer and hop on wasteland or tdm matches. scenario play? join one of the massive missions kicking around online. extremely cool and unique singleplayer experiences? hop on steam workshop and get one of the top rated missions. want to goof around with your friends? fire up a co-op mission. theres no game that offers you this much flexibility and this much room to stretch out in. if youre an arma vet, you know this already. unlike the previous arma games though, despite some bugs, its not completely inaccessible to the public. the server system is incredibly easy to use. steam integration is fantastic. the player models and controls dont feel like operating heavy machinery (except when youre operating heavy machinery). infantry controls are fluid. helicopters take time to master but are a joy once you do. tanks and armored vehicles are appropriately weighty (if a little low on torque and climbing power at times... i often wish i had manual gearboxes). play arma iii. youll have a lot of fun.",990.8

"this game runs well, plays well, and allows me to feel immersed in a realistic military survival scenario. did not get to play it long during the free period so to speak, but at the same time i still enjoyed my experience. i definitely plan on purchasing this game in the near future when i get the chance",7.3
"awesome game, for what it is designed for. arma is a military simulator. and that brings good and bad things. you cant go guns blazing everywhere like you would in cod. get shot 2-3 times, youre dead. thats it. your tank gets hit by a single missile? youre dead. you get sniped from a mile away by someone hiding in the bushes? youre dead. this game aims for realism, and it definitely achieves that. buy this game knowing that it is very different than typical fps shooters, but it is so much better in so many ways. the tactical abilities of your soldier, the controls to move your soldier, the gameplay with your friends and the mods that are created are amazing. the mods seriously make this game come alive. this is a great game. different from other shooters because its in its own category.",418.8

(lack of content to) it turned out to be a very fun game that me and my friends love to play. so much to do as in multiplayer, steam workshop with so much into it, you can even get creative with it like my hunger games mission! all in all very fun!",377.1

"arma 3 and the rest of the arma series is best enjoyed with either a good organized and not so serious group or friends. since this game lives by its user created content there is an editor included that lets you create you own missions. let those be small or large, easy or tough, you are the creator. not to forget the steadily growing amount of user created mods. this game is a simulator (sometimes for walking long distances), so do not expect any arcadey gameplay, you get shot, you may live and treat your wounds or you may die instantly. tactical thinking is the key here and running head on is mostly the wrong thing to do.",506.4

"been playing arma since it was operation flashpoint. this is not an fps, rpg or rts although it can be all of that all at once. this is a war simulator. you give command to your subordinate. you strategically flank your enemies. you take cover when you see a tank rolling while your at team mate solve the problem for you. this is not an easy game. regular fps player will find it puzzling that you have your enemies in your crosshair but failed to hit them because the physics of bullet drop hit them. on the downside, the ai is not up to par. the game is unfinished although it is more of a nuisance because you can always rely on the community to produce a far more better finished game after that. and then theres the i cant seems to stop myself from playing this game even though i completed it.",108.0
"revised my review as my last one it was only in alpha, but things have only got better. the possibilitys with this game are almost endless, the multiplayer is by far the most, enjoyable i have played. with so many different game modes, and mods available, you can never get bored. play with your friends and the fun just multiplies. dont get me wrong it has its problems, bugs are still there, and altis can be annoying at times with its lack of cover, but it is a real island, and if they strayed away and changed it, then i wouldnt be altis. the best thing with this game tho is its realism, when one bullet can take you down, and end your day. it adds a fear factor into the game play, where you seek real cover, use real line of sights, and have to make corrections for the ballistics of the weapons. its not for everyone. but any hardcore sim gamer will love this, its still has the arma feel to it, which was something i first thought it would loose. play it. for me, its a 9/10.",819.9

"arma 3 completley demenstrates the realism in the military its unique playstyle has realism written all over it. bohemia interactive must be really good at making realistic video games cause this game is so realistic that it can push your computer to its very limits. please note: players who hate pushing alot of buttons to do everything in this game, this game is not for you. they made the models in the game so much next-gen like, that they had to work hard in the performence rate, and they worked hard. 10/10 this game is truly a masterpiece.",52.6
"i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have diversity from being able to play a milsim to somebody who wants to mod the living daylights out it, there are many mods that subtle changes to the drastic changes like the dayz mod. i think it has the variety to be able to keep any player attracted the arma series for a long time.",113.5

"arma 3, successor of arma 2 and arma 2 : oa, is in my opinion the best arma game yet released. arma was always known for its moddabillity and the users freedom to create their own missions, since bohemia interactive released arma 3 tools modding became even more easy. there are many really good mods out there, some are as good and big as a whole dlc! the game without mods is also good of course, the campaign was well designed and there are many fun multiplayer missions, which you dont need mods for (only few actually need mods).everyone who played arma 2 or any other arma game, and liked it for its tactical depth, its moddabillity, all the multiplayer missions or for whatever reason this game is defenitely worth its money. a note to all dayz fans : dayz epoch (the most popular dayzmod version since somewhere in 2013 i think) is comming out for arma 3 somewhen, at least they announced it, only closed alpha when i last checked. tl;dr ? a good game !",198.9
"i loved flashpoint, but this game has one of the worst singleplayer campaigns ever! at some points completely unplayable. if you are into singleplayer - dont buy this game. the only thing you can enjoy here is the multiplayer which can be awesome at some points and it is the only reason why i have bought this game - at some point i was hoping the campaign will be at least a little enjoyable, but i am very dissappointed now. i dont recommend buying this game until they fix all the issues in the campaign.",36.6
"what do i think of arma 3, well i have mixed emotions. i belive its a good game, but there are alot of reasons i dont play it as often. first for it being the game coming out after the previous arma 2 i was expecting certian things to be added, like better ai, a physics engine, and a much better map. i think i expected a little to much. some ups about the game is its fun! yeah get it like srlsy",150.5

"the game is very immersive and you will get some unique experience in it. sometimes even the simplest scenario (you hiding from an enemy while waiting for rescue) can become really intense. i recommend if you buy/have the game you should try out tee times warfare (somewhat like conquest in battlefield but with a currency to buy your own vehicles) and wasteland which can become very hardcore, always expect the enemy to have a tank when you only have a pistol, very interesting. also the majority of the people you will meet in the game are helpful and nice people that are ready to cooperate with you. its always nice when the community is like this.",664.9
"one of the best games ive played. out of the box not quite as good but with mods like wasteland and breaking point, arma 3 takes it to a new level. the overall graphics are quite good but the lighting effects are absolutely stunning. the game suffers from a buggy feel. weird things can occur, falling trough floors, vehicles tipping over on a small rock and more, but considering all the good things, ill rate this game an a",733.2

"for what this game tries to be (which is a war simulator) it fails misserably at that. the movement is clunky, the a.i is dumb and overpowered as hell. so if you get into this game being all like yeah, this is what war is like, this is realistic and really precise then sorry. you need to get out in the real world pall. because i dont consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic. same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs. this game is however one of the funniest games i have ever played with friends. the amount of vehicles, the guns, the destructible enviorment. the overall map is not to shabby either. if you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that. if you get it to play it as a serious war game then id say the clunky motions and faulty a.i ruins that emediatly",12.3

"while arma 3 is a good game, it is still has issues. myself as well as a lot of other players have experienced multiple problems while playing, one such problem would be when we are launching the game, a message pops up saying handle is invalid. dont risk your $60 - $65 on a game that still has issues. dissapointing... edit: there have been a few things that i wish to add to this review. i think it was a poor decision on bis part to add dlcs that cost money with little content. the zeus free dlc/update hasnt done anything to the game multiplayer wise, the karts dlc looks a bit fun, but still needs more stuff, the helicopter dlc only adds 2 choppers and a few new gameplay mechanics that should have been in a free update, which costs $15. also, like i have stated before, my game often crashes on even at the lowest possible settings. im overall dissapointed in this game and its just a huge waste of money that could be put to games that are actually enjoyable and not riddled with bugs and costly dlcs.",56.2
"an great game which can be played in many ways. i didnt even complete the campaign as i didnt enjoy the parts where you start to command ai squads, but instead found lots of fun in the public co-op servers with semi-realistic team play. it also features one of the best online game communities, and because of some of the game mechanics, public servers are surprisingly enjoyable compared to other games. the game is not without flaws though, and especially in mp it is quite demanding on the cpu.",108.7
"game gets boring after awhile...hope you can find a good community server because bohe just gives you the game and relies on players to improve it. horrible company/decent game",650.8
"amazing army simulator thats more than just dayz. buy this game if you want a more realistic experience than call of duty or battlefield.",95.5
"really fun, but a different kind of fun than your typical shooter. this is about planning, bringing the right gear, the right friends, the right objectives and trying to execute the plan. even with the ai on the lowest possible setting, theyre geniuses compared to any other shooter out there. take your time, be patient and work your way through the objective. fun under the right circumstances",70.0

"bought this while it on was on sale for 50% off. so far it has been well worth the money and i plan to keep playing for quite some time. so far i have experienced hilarious moments with friends and in online servers but at the same time, ive experienced milsim roleplaying and taking scenarios and missions much more seriously which is a blast as well. although there can be an fps problem at times, which i have not experienced very much at all, i highly reccomend the game. with the in depth combat gameplay, amazing graphics, and and huge mod selection, i cant complain much. highly recommended.",147.8
"gritty realistic military stuff, very cool. has really good training scenarios that are actually worth doing. i got arma 2 for the zombies and this for the military combat. highly recommended -> 10/10",0.8
"ai is useless. i get injured and walk back to 10-15 friendlies, start calling out injured because i dont have a med kit. nobody responds. try again, one ai says hes coming. stands there not doing anything. took me 5 minutes to get my crew into a jeep, and 30 to get them out. this game uses every button on your keyboard, but none of them are labelled. this game tries to be realistic by making you walk an hour to get somewhere, but then once you try to actually do anything its a clunky mess.",2.5
"i really like this game, itsvery fun and full of action, but every time i play, i crash within 5-10 minutes on a server and i am pretty sure this happens to a lot of people. please fix this i really love this game.",168.5

"i really enjoy the multiplayer, especially the rpg servers, but the performance is not that good, for every player, no matter how good the hardware is. but i highly recommend for realistic combat and fun in general!",47.6
"this is simply the best simulation game ever and is very realistic. there are several amazing aspects of arma 3 including the graphics they are amazing at max settings it is just so impressive. the gameplay nails the realism but dosent get too frustrating and the sheer level of interactivity is staggering. the scale is another defining aspect of arma the huge map really is impressive and anything can happen from small pistol firefights to tank battles. modding is siply amazing with this game its easy to mod and installing them are quite easy too. really good stuff but it is very intensive on ur system",277.6
"its a good game just needs bette optimzation and some key bugs need to be fixed.",35.9
"if you expect a call of duty like game play you aint gonna kill for at least 25 play hours.... if you want to be challenged really hard, then buy this game. and if youre that person who throw controllers all around the room in anger when playing..... do not buy this game, youll probably end up hanging you and your whole family.",372.9

"this game is truly awesome, it has great combat mechanics and alot of great features like leaning and extra leaning? dont remember what is called :p though what truly makes this game so amazing is the community, the first server i ever played on was an altis life server, i bought the game just to play altis life, its a very satisfying (gamemode?) and the graphics are truly amazing considering the scale of the game. the campaign is also very cool though when playing for extended amounts of time i end up just killing my friends and restarting like 50 times :p all in all, this is a great game with good mechanics, good graphics, low lag though a little bit of lesser lag spikes and a great community, if you liked arma 2 youll love arma 3",22.0
"worst game ive ever played. bare bones in terms of content. the campaign is utterly stupid. super marksman enemy ai from the first arma game is back. perfoms like crap. campaign missions are awful. worst game in the entire series not worth the price of 59.99 not even worth the price of the early alpha that i paid for if i could get a refund for this garbage i would. this is the last arma game and the last game from bis i will ever purchase.",37.8

"arma 3 gives countless hours of enjoyment from your first kill to your first helicopter crash (destined to happen). either with friends, a community, or playing alone, it brings tactical realism shooters to a whole other level. if you take out the time to play the campaign, which starts with a prologue backed with 3 acts, you wont be disappointed. the campaign brings in a vivid and critical storyline, which i was amazed by. arma 3 has most definetely set a new standard for tactical realism shooters. truly an outstanding game.",373.6
"this is a great military simulator. the interface and the whole feel of the game has improved so much over arma 2 its almost a completely different game. very accessible (if you are willing to spend the time), even for someone who normally doesnt like to put much time into simulators.",50.5
"the game is solid, graphics, gameplay, realism and hilarious glitches. it has it. gather up a couple of buddies and take to the fields of battle. best thing about this game is the amount of detail that you can put in to your own missions. server setup is incredibly simple. also man gets hit by rpg in the face, stands up and continues to walk 15/10 game of the year",497.4
"very good game bt there is so much glitches that need to be fixed but great game. recommend this game to people who are patient it is alot of traveling. i have enjoyed it since having it.",279.5
"the game has great potential, but the problem with weapon swaying ruins the gameplay. it is impossible to hit an enemie at longer than 50m which makes the campaign almost unplayable. fix it and the game would be good.",64.4

"amazing level of control and realism. great variety in gameplay when playing as different classes, with different weapons and vehicles. however, this game still has ye olde arma feel to it, meaning that occasionally youll have to wait a decade to join a server, you suddenly drop to 2 fps, or get lifted into the air. the amount of fps you get also is kind of terrible i must say, but hey, its a beta, and itll get some kind of polishing before its released, im sure about that.",12.3

"arma 3 is an amazing game but right now im having trouble with the workshop so if you buy the game and no workshop shows up its a problem with steam not arma",929.2
"great game, tons of mods to choose from so ur sure to find something u like, wether its big battlefield style combat, or trying to run guns and drugs across the border, and of course zombies. great graphics, runs very well, nice and smooth, and brings a level of realism to shooters that is not seen elsewhere.",690.7

"with the built-in editor, the community has made so much great content for arma iii.. with user made 1p/co-op missions, online game modes, theres always plenty to do and always more stuff coming out (cmon epoch!). throw in some beautiful graphics and an amazing amount of detail, arma iii is easily one of my favorite games. i highly recommend this game.",369.5

"its arma 2 with better graphics and better lighting. if you liked arma 2 then youll like arma 3",519.3
"the best thing about arma 3 is the open ended content you can play on it, and you can get on a server with 10+ of your friends and play together against the computer or other people. the game has its glitches (network blips) that can be mitigated by going to a strong server host / game type and making sure you are close to it geographically. this is because the game world is huge, and you can see multiple kilometers away enemies running around and can snipe them from a distance or rocket their vehicle. i am glad that dayz got me interested in the arma series as i have had a blast with them so far.",296.1
"i love this game! so many different ways to play this game whether its a modded rpg or a survival apocalypse this game, in my opinion, is the best game to get if you want to download mods for it.",343.7
"arma 3 is a fun game to play with your friends and offline. the offline story is very god and its always action. if you thinking of buying it i just say do it! its worth it! but 1thing dont stop playing it in the beginig couse its hard, just restart and try a new tactic! ///sry for the not so good english///:) buy it!",80.1
"hours of content, great mod support, not greatly optimized but still overall great game.",141.5
"pros+ huge maps with lots of different terrane + plenty to do with in the game( story mode, editor, workshop, and more) + lots of servers cons- very slow gameplay (though that may be a pro for you) - wish it had more weapons - i have the recamended system but still sometimes have a hard time with the fps over all i do like the game and the fact that there is so much to do with it, but if you dont have a freind to play with it can be a boring. but dont worry there are lost of singleplayer things you can do with workshop.",49.7
"this game costs like $60 now.. but it should cost more .. because its awesome! yee! best graphic game ever see, nice tactics and the best thing is that you can make the mission that you wish for. and post it to others. and also so many missions are already in the workshop. would give the game a 10 out of 10 :o",2.4
"bought this game for the breaking point (dayz) mod,but i decided to give epoch and altis life a try.it was a blast i had a great time playing with friends,so i tought i should play the campaign,im sorry to say that it was horrible,the ai was dumb as f*ck even at the hightest level of difficulty,and sometimes game would crash at the end of a cutscene(although this might be an issue on my end).so overall i think that arma 3 is a great choice for those who want to play online,if you are looking for a good singleplayer campaign you might wanna avoid arma 3.",123.3
"whats better than opening a door and instantly dying? 10/10",228.6
"pretty dissapointed. to me, it doesnt live up to arma or arma 2. the campaign so far hasnt done anything for me, very repetitive, not much variety & i dont understand why theres been a month between each part of it. id rather much go back to a/a2 campaigns and replay them. i feel theyve been lazy in the lack of content for the single player side of things, not introducing any single player missions themselves like in arma or a2 & relying purely on the community for that aspect. for me, as much as i like playing online (through 2 very barren wastelands) i do like a good campaign to work through first and single player missions. id much rather play through the operation flashpoint franchise (bar red river & dragon rising because they were terrible.) as in my point of view for a war simulator they are still very much un-beatable",25.3
"a very good game althogh its difficult for the new players but its still intreseting and worth playing",50.5
"this game is by far the biggest time sink i have evr encountered in a video game. the simulation is done beautifully, and the night ops with tracer fire is so realistic sometimes youll die just staring in wonder. the mods add many many hours of new multiplayer experiences. this is a game that will stay on your hard drive for a long while. full price or steam sell this game is worth every penny.",298.2
"arma 3 ... where do you start all the kinks of arma 2 have been cleared, the engine runs smooth... the animations even smoother and the optimisation is always on the up and up. throught out armas history it has been clearly building up to this. the arma game to end all arma games. if you are considering buying remember... this isnt a fast action shoot emup (but sometimes it can be) this is tactical and stealthy. also if you buy this game and need someone to play it with you ... hit me and the 45th up :d",206.7
"great game it is addictive and there are lots of great community made mods to play with when you and they range from the interesting to the rididulous. highly recommended",717.7
"this is arma 3. the game we have been waiting for forever to improve our arma experience for along time coming. the game does add lots of cool new features to arma but the vanilla version of arma 3 lacks content. if you are planning to mod it and play with a group of people then i highly recommend arma for you, but in the long run without mods this game lacks content. 7/10",434.7
"a great milsim game... probably the best. the single player is lacking in story, but there is a plethora of online content and multiplayer fun to be had.",50.8
"horrible game. very rarely does anything actually work the way its intended to.",708.7
"warning: dont buy this game from when people pay for half finished game? tons of bugs, that makes the game allmost too hard to play. still there are some ok game modes, that make it a little bit better(personal tip: play altis life)",19.4
"arma 3 is definatly worth an investment especially if you like realisim and teamwork. you can play by yourself on multiplayer but to be honest its much more fun when with a group, even if its just 4 or 5 of you. the stock game lacks content (this is due to it still being developed) however due to its design arma 3 is a modders playground so alot of high quality mods are available to play with. is a little buggy in some areas even though the games been out a while, but its the 3rd game in a series and all have been like that. the bugs are managable and not game breaking, just very annoying.",780.1
"this game is one of the best i have ever played.. if your into games about stealth, combat, shooting and driving tanks and helicopters, this is one for you! get it now while its cheap!",64.4
"a solid upgrade from its predecessor (arma 2), the new movement system is outstanding and a really great edition to the game, the new engine really brings the maps to life, espically at night time, more enterable buildings then ever before makes for better gameplay and more care taken when clearing towns/buildings, once the mods that made a2 so great come across and get upgraded this game will be complete, bis add a bipod for christ sake!",304.1
"i dont think you can find a more difficult and exquisite game than arma 3. very hard, but a great strategy game that is even more fun to play with friends",53.9
"its so real its almost like am actually playing a video game.",35.5
"playing at 8 fps such good wow cant wait for new computer to max out at 60+ fps have to wait until xmas eve to get it whhhhhhhhhhy",7.6
"this game is a gorgeous achievement. the environments are beautiful, runs unbelievably well and content isnt bad. i loved operation flashpoint, and compared to ofp, technically anyway, arma 3 blows it out of the water. it seems to contradict its self however: once all the great, well polished and fitted pieces are put together, you get something not only worse than the first generation, but so bad as to be unusable. if the idea was to make a realistic military first person shooter, than this can be labelled as nothing less than a failure. not only that, but the fact that representatives of the dev team on the publishers forum refuse to listen to suggestions for playability adds salt to the wound. the fact that i bought arma2 just before support was removed and arma3 was released adds lava and acid to the same wound. ive been a gamer for 25 years, and have seen everything from masterpieces to unfinished games released as such, but loading up a game and knowing i will leave frustrated, angry and feeling cheated is completely new. bohemia has lost my support.",41.8
"unoptimized, has  game modes i can get in garrys mod, all game modes require you to suck the admins male sexual organ just to get in, and good luck if you can find your friends, because this piece of  doesnt even tell you, no, its not ing unrealistic to show you where your friends are, and it doesnt make the game more realistic, it makes it annoying and stupid. overall, im glad i didnt spend 30 or 60 bucks on this astraphy because this game sucks major monkey caca, 2/10 id rather play duke nukem forever",47.9
"this game is essentially a military simulator. if you are a cod fangirl (there are no cod fanboys because nobody who plays cod and loves it can possibly be classified as a fanboy) then this game is not for you. seriously. dont play it. for goodness sake please dont!! please i beg of you!! all i ever wanted was a game where there are no nine-year-olds who cant speak english thatcry in my ear!!! so yeah. arma iii is an amazing game. for adults. and mature people. not babies who cry because theyre parents wont buy them arma iii.",70.9

"i had a go at this game at a friends after he introduced it to me and then yesterday in the free weekend. it is an easy game to get to grips with the basic movements but takes time to learn and master some of the extra functions you have. grpaphics and game play are superb and smooth. i never notice any lag. the open style field of operations is huge. there are many weapons and vehicles to use. it is more akin to battlefield than cod. you are in squads with soldiers of different skills. you have pilots, medics, marksmen, engineers and infantry. you need a pilot to fly the choppers - you cant all do everything. so it is a true co-op. what i prefered with this game over battlefield is the co-op elelment of the game is humans against ai. this meant i did not take 15 mins to arrive at a battle with my level 1 peashooter only to be oblitorated by a soldier with a personal nuclear warhead! i believe there are humans v human servers too but i never tried these. this gives the novice time to experiment with the game and equipment. there is also an effective boot camp to train you before combat. i have only scratched the surface of what there is to learn. i will buy the game based on the co-op missions alone. you need time to play the game. it is not a 30 min game to play before bed!",217.8

"really great game, or simulator i should say despite the many bugs this game has (which eventually will be worked out), its really fun(if you have a high quality pc if you have a low-end pc you might want to think about upgrading before you purchase it, its a real cpu eater.). one dislike i have is the over-rated, over-played game modes wasteland and altis life but it really isint the game more like the community itself, its sometimes hard to find a good realism game mode with a decent amount of players or decent ping, and more guns could be added too (which are) its quite annoying to have to download a mod for a specific firearm. overall its a great buy, well worth the money",73.2
"i bought this game in the steam summer sale 2014 for a few euros ( 22.45 euros ) and i havent been disappointed since then. in addition i just can say that the graphics are awesome and that the mods ( f.e. : altis life ) are funny. sure no game is perfect so this game has also a few bugs here and there, but it is its money worth! well playing guys.",99.9

"this game is a really well developed combat strategy simulator, it offers an immersive combat experience from the experience of multiple command element from squad to battalion. the game may have its quirks but for the most part they are resolved by mods and 3rd party created content. i have played the entire arma series on disc format and have not been disapointed. arma 3 is an awsome game but i simply dont have the buget to buy it at this point although i would recoment it to any individual looking for great combat simulator.",8.7

"arma 3 does not have time to teach you how to play it. it does not have time to help you find someone to play with. it lacks the common decency to provide a story, of any kind, at release. bohemia interactives sandbox military simulation series began life in 2001 as operation flashpoint: cold war crisis before the developer retconned its own title, renaming the series arma. updating the game for modern pc players was a tall order, and after four long years of development arma 3 still isnt done. bohemia interactive made the decision to release it anyway. arma 3 may be the most challenging, and the most rewarding, online shooter i have ever played. but its missing key components  most damning of all a single-player campaign. as a result, it feels more like a huge demo than a finished product.",136.8

"this games definetly for people who like to be imaginative in the military action category. i like the tactical mechanics but i wish theyd change the fighting style of infantry when your a group leader. that problem makes the combat a little slow. other than that i am now in love with arma in general. the gameplay is a whole lot more fun than all these brand new fpss and it really throws you into the battle and isnt just point and shoot but brings it to a whole new playing level, making it feel that much more real. i have to say what makes the games a million times better is the modding community. there is never a single day where i am bored of playing this game, other than my inexperience with scripting in the editor, making it hard to look around and find solutions to my problems. i would seriously recommend this game for someone looking to have fun, sharpen their senses, or both.",556.1

"arma 3 is a great game. is it the best shooter? no. it does however have many features no other shooter offers. the ability to switch views is neat, but the real difference is gun positions. to prone, kneeling, leaning on that fence, rolling on your side, high and low ready with slung. if this game had the money of bf4 or cod it would blow them out of the water. team coms and work mixed with the pure massive size of the maps work well. the other large draw is the mods. where else can i cook meth, have a shootout, steal a helicopter, get away. then take out the herion dealers with the helicopter. lose it in the fight and be gunned down after running 2 miles trough a mountain trying to avoid a manhunt. almost anything or scenario that is avaiable irl can be set up in here. there are some downpoints like bugs and glitches, but no major ones. some nights are an effort in frustraion while trying to get geared up, then killed soon as you do. best when played with friends.",193.4

"i have to say, this game blew me away the first i tried it. heres what i think of the game: pros: -realistic, if you get shot twice your dead, no regenerative health. -editor allowing you to create your own missions. -hard combat makes you think on how to complete said missions. -you dont always have to be the commander, or even fight. -multiplayer gameplay can be intense and make you think even more than against the ai. -makes you work with your team to actually get stuff done. -actual terminal ballistics. -booming mod community. cons: -hard to learn controls (if new to series) -some minor bugs (this will go away hopefully after beta, so im not taking a point away for it) i cant think of any more. so, overall, i give this game a 10/10. edit: just thought of 1 problem that affects a lot of people: optimization issues. new score: 8.5/10.",80.0
"although i only played the free weekend my experience with the game (king of the hill and altis life) was pretty amazing. my only problem with it however is the battleroyale servers because they are always locked during a match which can take a longf time so to improve this i would make an area so players can wait for the match to finish. i was kind of sad about this because that was one of my main reasons to play arma 3 but i never had the chance. thanks to gassy mexican for showing the game on youtube (and making me play it)",9.7

"if you are looking for a real challenging game i invite you to try arma 3 cause you will die more than once during the entire game and that is a fact, no matter how many fps you have played or action and strategy games they wont be too much helpful, you will almost need a real military training to play this game because its a war simulator and hell it is hard but fun. i did not have the chance to try the full game but from what i could its fantastic its an open world in which you need to find your way in to go though and there is not just one path. you need to take your own decisions of how you are gonna make one mission depending of your resources and plan every single move you make, otherwise you are welcomed to visit death,its like chess, if you did not paid attention to the moves of your opponent you will lose. you may be freely walking and up ahead there is a patrol that you did not see coming or you step over a landmine or even fall in your own traps which happened a lot times to me. yeah i know the game is frustrating but when you fit in the game it will be a different story. and lets not forget of the beautiful graphics and enviroment that the game offers. 10/10",9.8

"the game does have some pretty minor glitches but other than that arma 3 is a great game for community development. devs out there create some pretty fantastic mods and addons for the games because of the huge open world maps and functions bohemia interactive provides in arma 3. many people buy this game just for the amazing addons to the game which allow very unpredictable scenarios to happen. arma is intriguing to me because the game is unpredictable. games that are unpredictable are more of a way for players to choose how they play and gives a slight immersion. there can be scenarios where you see a heli crash onto a building which is 100 meters away and that building had one of your best soldiers now knocked out waiting to ambush the enemy who is surrounded with opfor. what do you do? arma is fantastic because its your choice of how you want to play the game where other games have straight up orders to do stuff, why would you want to do that? i would give this game a 9/10",493.7

"tons of bugs, the ai is horrible, the enemy ai can shoot your  off from across the map, commanding the ai is a , trained soldiers cant keep their weapon still after sprinting 5 meters, c-3po has smoother movement than the player. i know this is a milsim but it doesnt play like a sim at all, controls are confusing and there is too many of them and theyre spreads across the keyboard making me feel like i have to use both my hands on the keyboard. it feels like im trying to fly a spaceship, not make a human do simple everyday movement. yes i know i can place my own keybinds but whats the point of making the controls stupid like this in the first place? flying planes and choppers seems to be harder than it was in arma 2, im not sure if anything is changed or if its just been a long time since ive played arma 2 so im not gonna criticize that. as far as tanks and other land vehicles go it has the same problem as controlling the soldier, stiff and confusing, and the instructions arent really helping. if you like the feeling of actually having control of the charcter youre playing. dont get this",16.8

"for what this game tries to be (which is a war simulator) it fails misserably at that. the movement is clunky, the a.i is dumb and overpowered as hell. so if you get into this game being all like yeah, this is what war is like, this is realistic and really precise then sorry. you need to get out in the real world pall. because i dont consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic. same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs. this game is however one of the funniest games i have ever played with friends. the amount of vehicles, the guns, the destructible enviorment. the overall map is not to shabby either. if you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that. if you get it to play it as a serious war game then id say the clunky motions and faulty a.i ruins that emediatly",12.3

"first of all, the single player campaign is a complete and utter waste of disk space. this was a big disappointment to me because i generally hate multiplayer because of cheaters, whiners and knowitalls. fortunately, i let myself persuade to give multiplayer a chance anyway. the first three days i was just running around, getting shot and not scoring a single kill. it was extremely frustrating but deep down i always knew that it was my own fault. then i started figuring out how to move without getting spotted, hold my fire until the right moment and stay alive by aiding my team mates. there are tons of good mission servers out there, find one that suits your style. my favorite is king of the hill team deathmatch. me? im a very patient sniper. ill wait and see what youre up to, move to a good position, get the exact range and send a single projectile your way. other times ill grab a silenced assault rifle and sneak up on your favorite spot in the cover of darkness. either way, youll never know what hit you. some call me a camper. they are called targets :-)",141.5

"this review is from someone new to the arma series and military simulators. the most enjoyment i have found from this game has to be the scenario editor. if you enjoy map editing and/or scenario editing i would highly recommend this game. also the multiplayer is quite enjoyable if you find a good team or good scenario. the game is graphically gorgeous. has some of the best lighting effects ive seen since metro. on the downside. your character fatigue is ridiculous. for being a simulator you will immediately die if shot. but on the other hand you have to shoot the ai several times before they will. the game can be very complicated at times if youre not familiar with this like myself. all in all its a very good game if youre willing to put the time and effort to learn everything.",181.5
"arma 3 has great graphics and sound effects compared to arma 2. however, ive observed many gameplay bugs while playing multiplayer online. also, the arma 3 maps arent nearly as good as the original chenarus map in featured in arma 2. luckily they were able to port chenarus over to arma 3 which makes arma 3 a much better game. honestly, when i first bought the game right after release, i was not impressed by the altis map - it was too open and flat, then when the terrain changed, it had too many valleys. it would be hard for me to recommend this game to others because of the annoying multiplayer bugs, then you have to deal with battleeye problems which can either kick you back to your desktop or not let you connect to a server at all. arma 3 is a tough game to play due to its military simulation style of gameplay and therefore i would consider this game a serious pc game. console games cant get even come close to the fine level of detail for player movement controls. the keyboard and mouse rule over the gamepad controller for first person shooter games. esdf for life, not wasd. i play arma 3 online with a close group of friends and its very fun for chenarus wasteland.",144.0

"i really like this game. tons of fun , a lot of mods wich my favorites are altis life and wasteland. you can spend hours of gameplay non stop laughing (depends on the mod you are playing) and tons of different weapons , vehicles. ill give it 8/10 only because not every person can play this game its really heavy and the other down side is you need to learn the keybinds because there is a lot of them. love this game. <3",88.2
"the worst. the campaign is lame and lacking, to say the least. i had to restart it because of friendly fire 10 seconds in while i was driving the truck at least 4 times, for no reason...? as soon as you come across enemy forces, which were your allies 10 seconds earlier, you have to shoot them 4 times with your  weapon while they shoot you twice and youre dead and you have to restart from 5 minutes prior, sitting through the same horrible coms talk between leaders. tried some multiplayer, wouldnt even let me chat to ask them how i can move considering i started as a citizen with my hands cuffed behind my head on a random island no where near anyone or anything... what the  is that? im hoping steam will refund my money, this is my most regrettable purchase yet. dont buy this game.",126.7
"its o.k and all but i really think some things need improvment. the sprinting animation is really unrealistic for me and when you play the game on minumin graphics, you get these weird light glitches across the sky. also for $60, i think is too overpriced. i got the arma 2 complete collection for $40 and thats better value. the gunplay in arma 2 is somewhat realistic and the running animation is a whole lot better plus you can get dayz free of charge. overall im a little dissapointed with arma 3, i wouldve thought it would of been better. 5/10",13.0

"this allowdamage false; fatigue mechanic makes me want to punch children. aside from that, an updated engine which looks ten times better, and actually runs smoother than the a2oa engine. everything is much more fluid and smooth audio has recieved a major update too, weapons sound better, soldiers dont sound like robots. my only gripe is that im not sure how i feel about the game being launched in an unfinished state, theres still a bunch of base content on the way that was initially supposed to be able at launch. arma is what you make of it, you can use it as a toybox, or you could use it as a sprsrs tacticool dad game. works just fine for either",199.5

"still early days for me yet as i am still learning, but what i have seen from this game so far is nothing but awesomeness... vast landscape - the map is absolutely huge... some players end up having a full time job air lifting people to the hotzone and then back to base and pick up the next lot of soldiers... the graphics - are absolutely spectacular the sound - is amazing, really is an immersive experience realism - the most realistic military game i have ever played... if you are a call of duty fan... forget it, get out of this page and do not buy this game... you cannot go in guns blazing, you cannot even run from cover to cover without getting puffed out in which causes you to lose accuracy... battlefield players that feel that battlefield just doesnt have enough realism, you may appreciate this game as i am an ex-battlefielder and i love this game... the bad - extremely hard... and there are soooo many buttons to remember, but practice makes perfect... 9/10 - it loses a point because you cant just pick it up and play, it requires lots of time, practice, patience and discipline.",22.6

"this game is awesome. a definite buy for anyone interested in realistic military simulations. theres a mod for almost anything annoying you may find in the game which is a huge plus. you can create and edit your own missions. it doesnt get much better than this. if your on the fence about buying it, do yourself a favor, and buy it now while its on sale.",80.7
"amazing level of control and realism. great variety in gameplay when playing as different classes, with different weapons and vehicles. however, this game still has ye olde arma feel to it, meaning that occasionally youll have to wait a decade to join a server, you suddenly drop to 2 fps, or get lifted into the air. the amount of fps you get also is kind of terrible i must say, but hey, its a beta, and itll get some kind of polishing before its released, im sure about that.",12.3

"the game is not optimized at all and performs like crap. the a.i. is terrible. enemies lock on to you, and never miss. landmines are impossible to spot so sometimes you just blow up at random. you also die in one or two hits from bullets. i get that this game is trying to be authentic but it does a really bad job at it. the friendly a.i. charge straight in because they cant die, while yelling at you to stop taking cover and move up. if you do try and move up you will usually be killed instantly, because the enemies just never stop shooting straight at you. outside of the campaign, the game still isnt very fun. the world is mostly just desert with a bunch of scattered small towns, and exploring it is really boring, even in a tank. the characters control awkwardly, which makes the enemy problem even worse because you cant react quickly to being shot at. since the game is out of its early access phase, these things probably wont get fixed. finally, the price. it is $60 as of oct 24, 2014. there are lots of other shooters out there, that offer so much more content, responsive controls, perform well on your computer, dont have lock-on insta-kill a.i., and cost less than half of that. i do not recommend arma 3",5.0

"best first person shooter ive ever played! challenging, realistic, wide open,you name it... its in this game. even vehicals got their realisticness maxed out!",39.6
"this game is very well done. it is about as close as you can get to total realism in a game. this is also somewhat a downside though. it makes missions being done by yourself without any ai or player assistance very difficult. but if you have a group of friends to help you take on some of the missions, you will enjoy this game. the multiplayer is awesome. before i found this game, i had always been searching for a game with a gamemode that has teams with about 65 players or so each all fighting over one point. the workshop feature makes the game even better, being able to download new missions whenever you finish the ones you already have. this is overall a pretty cool game.",26.6
"i would definately recomend this game to people who like semi-realistic warfare. it has unpresidented modding support which allows just about anything you could imagine in the game. it has a vast number of custom gamemodes and thousands of mods. 9/10 really really good.",100.4
"this is real live military battlefield. this is not arcade fps game. (ex - call of duty , battlefield) this is full real simulation training game. but... no jump support... :d",69.0

"great game, massive improvement over arma 2, the editor mode is great because you can set up your own missions or just blow stuff up if you want. also there is a great modding communtity",261.2
"this game is a tactical realism genre, you should only buy this game (59.99$ usd) if you like a tactical realism game. or if you are a arma 2 fan..there are not just millitary missions also there is atlis life rpg.wasteland (pve) pvp this game has an active community in the workshop uploading awesome missions used with the editor.they just recently added a 3d editor called zeus which will lets you strike lightning at people!.there are still glitches in the game but the devs are working hard to fix it.guess what no hackers!but the arma physics are ape .. and finnaly if you dont like the original game there is the moded version! dayz breaking point,has been released. new weapons,vechicles and maps for a new experience every time.arma 3 can get repetitive if you dont switch to another gamemode. the games graphics are beautiful :d a huge improvement compared to arma 2. ;d if you wanna check if youre pc can run this game google can i run arma 3?",568.7
"this game is great although i have found that i constantly get errors telling me that im missing entries.",95.8
"dopest dope!!! sooo much content!! sooo many possibilities!!",46.7
"buyer beware. this game is not worth $60. let me make that perfectly clear. its a year old (since release) and is still an extremely poorly optimized game. my only advice is to make sure you have a fast gpu (4+cores means nothing here), an ssd (it loads textures directly so an hdd will be a bottleneck), and read plenty of forums on how to best optimize it for your system. this game appears to be player driven moreso than developer. hence (in addition to lack of optimization) why i believe that this should never be worth $60. controls are clunky and awkward, and the simulation aspects leave something to be desired. if you still intend on picking this one up, make sure its on sale.",243.8
"great game if you enjoyed playing any of the other arma series. already has life mods, and dayz mods available to play on. expect some similar to arma 2 bugs/quirks but nothing really game breaking in my opinion. a lot of the issues that comes with the multiplayer gameplay is usually server-side more than client-side issues, which even at that point i have not seen many bad servers. multiplayer is fun, steam workshop integration is awesome as well!",195.4

"this game is great. it has tons of different gamemodes to choose from. its a great realistic game with great graphics. (warning: need preety decent computer to run well) some of the best gamemodes include, altis life(stratis life, arma life) which is a role playing gamemode, where your goal is to make that moolah. whether it be selling apples or dealing drugs. another gamemode is wasteland, an open world gamemode where you make money and fight other player. to wrap this up, i would definately recommend this game. great to play with friends.",583.5

"i personally like arma 3 for its mass potential. a lot of the people are great and the different gametypes create an immersive aura that you just cannot avoid. i plan on playing arma 3 for a long time, this game is extremely good. there is too much to talk about to really give you a firm grasp of what i am trying to say. the combat is more fun, movement is fluid, people are great. what else would you want?",629.9
"just dont buy it......it needs a nasa pc to play (no, 30fps is not playable in this game....dev, why u do this??? then, you can have 35fps in solo but 4 fps in multiplayer!!!??? again, why? (while in multi, we have lesser players/aircraft e.t.c.) most servers are rpgs....almost no coop server. its very hard to find real strategy/realism/gameplay here.....the vids you see on youtube do happens, but its very rare....dont buy it. arma 3 is maybe the worst game i have ever bought after shogun 2..... and i really wanted to buy it....",2.9

"i remember getting arma 2 on special back in the day, played it once then put it on the shelf. then i seen this mod called dayz and i have been sucked into the arma world ever since. more to the point, arma 3. a vast improvement on its predecessor but still a game that takes a lot of trial and error before you really get the hang of it and can appreciate the engine. the single player campaign was slowly worked on and released over time, with fixes and improvements over a period of time to end up with a really nice and although linear storyline, they really add elements that allow you to verge away from the main storyline and engage in heaps of other tasks and activities ( i had to play the main campaign twice to appreciate it) the main reason to get arma 3 though is the mods. from breaking point, epoch to a heap of mission maps and game modes, arma really throws a lot of diversity at you and is great bang for your buck.",593.4

"quite possibly the worst game i have ever played. vehicle control is stupid. helicopters are impossible to control. your tank crew is borderline . enemy hitbox is the size of a pixel, meanwhile yours can be hit while you are behind a house. biggest waste of money ever. this game is an aweful scam.",107.2
"i`ve been playing this game for over a month and i`m pleased with it.if you want to buy it i strongly encourage you to buy it if you have a friends that bought the game.this game is made for multiplayer.you can play the campaign and workshop missions.i`ve been playing 3 modes:altis life,wastleland and battle royal.i enjoy them and i don`t get bored by them.i play with my friends with amplifies the experience. pros: a alot of mods to choose from enjoyable if you have friends..... you don`t get bored easily/ cons:you need a good pc to run this game on 30-60 fps i don`t really liek the singleplayer missions(personal opinnion.) it`s kinda expensive.",117.4
"best game ever! there is so much content because of people making addons, missions, mods all the time, this is like 10000 games in 1. best purchase ive made! only down side is that its in the future. i mean that they are using prototype vehicles that nobody knows about. it would been a 10/10 game for me if they just made arma ii with this updated engine and graphics!",613.8
"probably the best game i have ever played with endless hours of fun. there is always a new mod to try out or game mode to play and multiplayer is its key selling point.",213.7

"huge maps, amazing graphics, smooth performance, great gameplay... if youre looking for a milsim or slow paced shooter, than this is the game for you.",54.3
"1/10 this game is very bad, the game is very slow paced and has no kill streaks whatsoever. also the soundtrack is really bad and contains no skrillex or even major lazer. this all adds up to me not being able to show noobs how much of a dominant player i am. do not buy this, put it down and play the new call of duty instead.",122.8
"coming from someone that played a1 and a2 when they came out, away before it dayz mod. arma 3 is a big ing cluster crap. there are some improvemnts on the gameplay but the problem in the game is the engine. i have a high-end pc, i cant play it with more than 30 fps ( singleplayer i can max 50 fps without any ai spawned), with the last updates i am now unable to enter any multiplayer server. i have search for solutions everywhere and nothing. the game is more like a bug that you have to deal with if you want to have fun, a bug that was present in the other armas but not as bad. dont buy this game unless its really really cheap, the devs dont care about the game, as a long long long time fan of the series, this is certanly the last arma or product i will buy from this company.",24.6
"recommended for people who enjoy cod. but feel trapped in tiny maps with no ability to drive/fly vehicles at will. arma has all of those and more",253.5
"if you like super realistic, first person shooters, this is the game for you!",47.8
"there is really no way of explaining this game to anyone who hasnt played it. its awesome. its fun. its total freedom. its a community. its dedication. its tons of bugs and glitches. its the thing you want to do with your friends on a friday night. its blowing  up, cruising with technicals and flying in helos. its at the same time realism and make-believe. its frustratingly hard at times. its long intervals of doing nothing. its modding, modding and more modding. its fps drops. its only limited by your imagination. its even more awesomeness. hell, enough talk! buy the the godd*mn game!",459.6
"reality of combat system is just outstanding. in one multiplayer fight i have been crowling with my teammates for 30 minutes to get to the enemy base during the night. we finally did it and with our great communication skills we managed to eliminate enemy team.",47.8

"this game is a very good game with lots of expansions graphics are great",42.1
"beautiful graphics, massive scale (terrain is huge and plenty of weapons and vehicles to use). the game has a growing mod support, gametypes like wastland, battle royale, king of the hill and domination gives the game a big lifespan, where boredom is a hard thing to find. the requirements are a bit demanding, but with an old phenom processor and gtx 660, i run the game fine.",241.8
"just like arma 2, theres a huge amount of variety in gameplay with this game. the graphics are fantastic, although most people probably wont be able to run this game on full settings at a reasonable framerate. worth picking up, even if youre not planning to play it in the immediate future.",645.3
"this isnt a very detailed review but yea this isnt just another fps fast action game or another rts at all. if youre new to the genre its more like operation flashpoint if youve played that. if not its about as realistic to real life mil sim as you can get. you will die alot even, fire fights can be anywhere from several hundred meters away or up in your face. you will either love it or hate it",191.2
"i am in love with this game. after hosting my own server and really getting into all the details i can now say that im almost sure this is my favorite game. ever. its intense, hard and beautiful, its not bf4, if you run and gun you die. i dont think it gets much more real than this. disregard original review: i want to like this game, but the campaign is utterly horrendeous. bugs and unplayable missions. the mp is great but the fps are  for some reason. all in all this is a wonderful game that is ruined by crappy coding. dont buy it. if you want bugs get dayz, at least they warn you.",160.6
"if you love milsim this is the alpha male of that category!!! enjoy and check out my youtube",152.7
"i really got deep into this game and i could tell from the moment i began playing that this was bohemias baby. the amount of detail in both the environment and realism was evident and it took me by surprize. arma 3 is a significant improvement over arma 2 in every area from the beautiful visuals to the ballistics of the weaponry. i personally am a sucker for realistic shooters so this was right up my alley, the feeling of dropping an enemy from 500 meters with one bullet really gets me excited. id recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of bohemias past games and likes more of a realistic shooter rather than arcade like shooters similar to cod ghosts and football manager 2014. get this game pronto as its really good actually just kidding everyone i couldnt run it at all i wish i was dead :(",50.1

"this is a lovley game. i have trouble finding immersion in games but this game is where its at. i can sit an play this game for hours on end and not get bored. has an amazing story and the multiplayer is just great. there is zero reason to not have this game. 11/10 amazing job bohemia. *note even though it has some bugs i only find those relevent in multiplayer and its not even that bad. doesnt take away from the game at all in my opinion.",43.3
"like its predecessors, arma 3 succeeds at supplying a realistic, entertaining, and accurate game experience that provides great scenery, new weapons and units, a community-based scenerio workshop, and a game that can be played professionally with a developed community or leisurely on a public server.",87.8
"arma 3 is an expansive military simulator that excels beyond any game i can think of off the top of my head in both realism and graphics. as a pc gamer it is practically a requirement to get this game (assuming you like fps). it is really fun and is potentially a mix of an fps, rpg and military simulator (with sandbox!) the steam workshop adds tons more content as well such as missions, racing mods, and pretty much anything you can think of...",18.8
"arma 3 is, by far, the best millitary simulator ive ever seen. only for those who like hardcore millitary simulators.",169.0

"100/10 a game were anything is possiable. mods were you can see the fish you want to catch , run drugs and sell tortise meat. this game is the only fps were maps overlooking the world are usefull and radios are a nessecity , a great fps if you just want to have array of activities that dont invole you killing or shooting others like mining or picking peaches.",397.8
"if ur buying this just for the campaign specifically dont get it, its impossible and i only play on regular i play most campaigns on veteren or hard im not bragging but im an alright player,however, the multiplayer and mods are amazing the world is absolutely huge and there is two islands, also it is the most authentic military simulator i have ever seen and the graphics are just stunning if your pc is up to the task",4.9
"an interesting game, dont buy it if you expect average close combat. most fights take place at 100m+ distance, weapons are laser-like accurate, and the smallest map is about 5x the size of battlefield 3s largest map. comes with a robust mission editor and splendid tactically realistic screenshot simulator (heh), the graphics are unbeatable. the campaign is pretty nice as well. +great graphics. +great infantry controls. +interesting campaign, even if the storyline sucks. +robust mission editor. +modding tools. +lovely aircraft sound effects, good vehicle controls. -hates your computer, doesnt want to run well. -ai is . -no weapon resting on random objects. -campaign ending was a cliffhanger.",874.4
"i started of playing arma 2 but came out somewhat frustrated because of the controls and interface, the game explored new concepts but was not an enjoyable or intuitive interace. arma 3 and a completley different expirience for me. the game still looked and felt like arma 2 but they have fixed my few problems that i had with the previos game, making probebly the best expirience in a game ive had in a long time, the map armory 2 by happy comedy makes the game easier to learn alowing players to test out vehiclels, a must have map. the 60 dollar price point can turn people off but trust me, if you are looking for vehiclels, guns, boats, scuba diving, drones, tanks, cars, planes, helicopters, and a @#$% ton of amazing and cool mods, this game is definitly for you. -fuze",202.7

"arma 3 is a great game if you loved previous chapters and you enjoy combined arms wanna-be simulators. its completely customizable and has an experienced community developing tons of additional content. unfotunately the game suffers from an old engine concept limitations wich makes everything feel clunky and buggy. the single player campaign is one of the worst ever created and doesnt reflect at all what a military operation is but its there so if you want to give it a shot.. plus the plot has almost no effort put in it. arma series fortunately relies for the 1% on single player campaign and 99% on community made content and coop multiplayer wich is the real core of the game. a must have if you want to join a clan that plays this game as a serious simulation.",171.5
"this game is way to realistic for what it is trying to do. out of the first two missions i have played it has made me go cod lone ranger twice and you can die way to easily if this game was like cod or battlefield where you regen health and you can not get two shot then maybe it would enjoyable. i am not saying i do not approve of challenges but it creates unrealistic scenarios with super realistic fighting mechanics. i also do not like the recoil and how the enemies can soak up 500 bullets ( exageration) before they die.",52.0

"arma 3. game where you need instincts turned on! in this game when you are in team. you need to work as a team. leaving your teamates = death. in this game there is no 3 seconds behind wall and fight again. no! when you are shot, you need to heal yourself, conserver ammo. who loves games that are hard, but giving you a big satisfaction. then buy arma 3. if your bored waiting 3 secons behind cover and go to fight. buy arma 3. map (there are 2 island) is that huge that even maps of bf with cod are 1/4 size of it.there are many weapons, vechiles, armors. this is called war! do you know defition of war? no? i will tell you. its arma! <3",18.3

"worst controls ever, and i cant even change them. i just died because i couldnt get the water i bought! every other game out there is pretty straight forward with the controls, i think i literally hit every key on the keyboard, couildnt get the water/food in my backpack and died.... this game was never finished, and its probably something really silly.... thx arma for the crappy computergame. dumbest controls in the world bar none. i cant even figure out how to stop my head from looking around vs my body!!!",10.2
"arma 3 was released on steam in early-access and at the time, i was happy to help the creators by financing the project, although the game was far from being finished. now, the game is said to be finalized but theres very little progress from the beta version and the new dlcs require you to pay even more money for a game that is still lacking some essential gameplay features. although the game is good fun overall, i find it definitely overpriced. go for it if you really dont know where else to spend your hard-earned cash :)",79.1

"seemed pretty fun, but i think it would be much better if it was actually optimised and able to get more than 25 frames. its way to arcadey, and took arma 2s barebone flight mechanics and somehow made it worse. barely anyone online (probably playing their $30 mod) too. playing this game makes me want to be a ing terrorist, so i could do the world a favor and kill the team at bi who made this. 9.999999999/10 its alright",8.4
"too long brothers, have we suffered mediocrity- and have come to lower our standards.. too much have we become complacent- and we have seen aaa games ignore what might have been.. seen them become recoated year after year, taking a franchise and driving it too the ground. well no more, here we have arma3, a game that stands against the tide and wants to do more, be more, give more. here is a game where you cannot simply walk into mordor or compare it to any other notable shooter. mission editors, powerful moddable platform, amazing graphics, as close to realism you can get with regards to weapon and vehicle dynamics, incredible maps and attention to detail. to name but a few elements that make arma3 great. my absolute highest praise for arma 3, for being what they set out to be, and not seeying the players as atms. tldr: you are whats wrong with the world.",591.9

"a nice simulator. unlike other games that try to give a warfare experience but instead give you a stupid cqc stage, in this game, it is do or die, you must team up, but you can give it a try to being solo, of course, it will not be like call of duty or medal of honor, it will be... an unique close-to-real warfare experience. the game has few guns, but they are unique and can make a difference. the variants are extended, making it a huge library of choices you can have. the bullets have an unique rendering, and you can have tracers (red, green.), which can be seen and can help to tell a nearby teammate where the enemy is. the vehicles are decent, most are sluggish and it does not really give you a civillian feeling, but it gives out most of the military feeling. many servers to play in, with different modes: altis life, co-op, zeus and so on. you can find a game mode you want, and with the huge quantity of modifications existing around steam and the internet, you will certainly never stop playing, unless tactics or marksmanship isnt your thing. 9.5/10",199.7
"i completely stand behind this game. this is a military simulator so right off the bat you know that this is not the typical call of duty, or newest battlefield game. it takes strategy and teamwork to complete the missions when playing co-op. when speaking of multiplayer, you have so many options. i have not even gotten to the story yet because i have played so much multiplayer. you can choose to play some of the core missions that are included with the game, but you can also play mods that other people create, this is where i feel that the game excells. i have played many of the most popular mods to date on this game such as arma life, altis life, breaking point, epoch, and many more. i can confidently say that even if you do not like the core missions of the game you can sink countless hours into most of the multiplayer mods/servers that this game has. now for the only downfall i have come across when playing the game, you cannot play this on a low end pc, this game is very un-optimised and you need some powerful hardware to run the game smoothly. i have a gtx 970, and a i7-4790k and i still experience some bad framerates on certain servers and mods, so be warned you wont get 1000 fps, but that aside it is a amazing game. solid 10/10.",136.7

"arma 3 is probably the best game ive played on pc. this milsim sandbox, although incredibly fun and addictive, it is also incredibly frustrating. since its a simulator there are many things you have to learn in order to do the most simple things. but, with its incredible detail and loads of items youll probaly spend the first few hours looking at all the different guns or crashing a helicopter a few seconds after you get in it. this may seem like the game is too hard for anyone to play but trust me, after a while youll get really good at it and feel proud for some reason. this game has so much to offer with all of its combat scenarios, and with the surprisin amount content you can mess around with, it truely makes it my favorite game. 10/10",346.1
"awesome game. (as long as you have an extremely powerful cpu.)",31.8
"this game is addictive. yet it has tons of bugs, its fun. if you are concerned that you wont like it, try watching some altis life videos on youtube, and buy the game when it is on summer or christmas sale on steam. now, lets get to what really matters. there are two sides to this game. there are the rp servers, and then there are the milsims. the rp (roleplay) servers are easy to get, it deals with altis and turns your gaming experience into a life, which then you have to develop your character and become friends (or enemies) with others. you can mug, kidnap, and  (if youre experienced) other people. this gamemode is for if you want to have some laughs, and a  ton of fun. if you are wanting the military simulator part of this gamemode, then go check the millitary simulation servers. there are fewer of them, but they can be still be fun. this gamemode provides a damn good simulation of war on altis. ranging from hardcore strategies to commanding your troops, this gamemode emits a real life enviroment for you to practice your gaming skills in. thats all, hope it helped!

"besides the fact your enemies turn into slender man everytime you shoot them, this game is by far best arma besides combat operations and arma 2 but graphics do matter cause in low settings on arma 3 is like medium on arma 2. also this game is very futuristic in a way the csat are the closest thing to the modern day terrorists and the aaf are your greek resistance the only modern thing in this game is nato they use commanche helis, mraps, ghost hawks, and who ever is wondering whats a ghost hawk? it was the prototype heli used to transport the navy seals to kill osama. finally the game modes are crazy fun like escape from stratis and they have steam workshop so you can download missions instead of making one your self they also have pvp but due to desync it wont be as fun as playing coop with friends. the campaign in this isnt like the one from previous armas its more dynamic it tells the story of how nato is being attacked by aaf and the csat i wont spoil anything because this is a review not the campaign",597.9

"well i got this in alpha release when it was $30 but if i didnt i would gladly pay the full price for it. awesome game i definately got 3 times my value that i invested in it and i am getting more!!! the updates will  your internet but they come with huge content. the developers are really giving people their worth in both time and money. easily becoming a better shooter then any cod game and is even leading the hard to beat bf series. my score: 10 out of 10 and it just got out of beta!!! cant wait to see what else the developers add to this!!",9.3

"oh yeah sure just bought arma and now its even on sale for less ofcourse it always happends to me, but yeah awesome game though.",46.6
"this game is amazing although it keeps getting frozen. however its okay my internet provider reads out its constant motto hakuna matata. i was outside in the recent snow and i was asking myself if i want to build a snowman but then i thought i just cant wait to be king of altis. i died one time with my scuba gear under the sea but everythings better when i am wetter in my own pee pee . i had a recent visit to kavala and i saw a hobo i thought to myself who is that girl staring back at me. i then saw a hench po po man and i thought i wanna be like you i wanna talk like you i wanna walk like you. so i ran up to him and grabbed his sweaty bicep and said youve got a friend in me. it is best to start of by buying the bare necessities in altis like backpacks and stuff but think about yourself really its a whole new world out there. however dont insult police because i got shot. p.s i guess thats the circle of life",217.0
"only buy this game if ur pc is from 2013 otherwise not worth it.. well singleplayer its nice but if u dont like singleplayer and only play multiplayer like me and u have a older pc dont buy this.. the fps is horrible online to matter what server u play on. for example: my pc is 4 years old. high setting in single player =70 fps witch is awesome. multiplayer on lowest of the lowest settings = 10 fps max just bare this in mind. thank you for reading. p.s when i get a better pc i play the crap out of this :d",32.9
"a friend made me buy this game. in thing sucks! prepare to waste hours of your life not having any fun.",31.0
"lot of amazing mods, i think anyone who plays this will love altis life. so a great time with friends and who doesnt enjoy stealing other peoples organs? just make sure you have a decent rig or you wont have a very good time. 10/10 would play again :d",613.5

"if you love milsim, or just the realism and simulation, then arma is the game for you! arma 3 specifically is much better optimized, at least for me so far, than the previous games. huge improvements since arma and arma 2!",415.5
"this is one of the best games that i have ever played. the single player is very dynamic and keeps you interested. the only problem that i have with the game is that when you close out of it and restart the game the graphics are a little wierd and make the game unplayable. this can be fixed by restarting the computer.",20.6
"a pretty darn good game i should say, amazing campaign, and i love multiplayer, plus, the good thing is that you can shift from 3rd person view to 1st person view, what are you waiting for? go get it now!",3.2

"a very fun, military game that gets really intense.",82.1
"amazingly fun, amazingly hard. this is for real, folks. forget about running and gunning. forget about killing soldiers who see you first. youre dead. annoying? yes. but so much fun, still! i love the feel to the game. the graphics are amazing, and its incredibly immersive. especially coupled with a good head tracking system like the trackir!",70.0
"this game has a distracting dialouge, and with your guns it is impossible to aim and there are so many game-breaking glitches. in the first five minutes i walked infront of one of the npcs on the road and then he got stuck and i had to restart the entire game. i was playing it when it was free for a week but i highly do not reccomend that you buy this game at sixty dollars. there are many better things that you could spend that on. overall you should not buy this game.",1.2
"at first i was like - (   ) but then - (   ) and then a bit after- (   )",204.3
"when i played arma 3 during the free weekend a few weeks ago, i enjoyed it a lot and i also like the graphics and the interface. it really fits in with the players. altis life rpg - definitely recommend it, go play it...",76.9
"i can be an elite soldier with a big  gun while wearing nothing but my underwear.",18.3
"cant run it on my dell laptop well but from the little bit that ive played it its pretty fun i guess",23.2
"this is definitely one of the hardest games i have played, i mean, i tried the first mission +30 times on easy and never survived the first encounter with the enemy. i had to find a cheat just to get past the the first battle, but the next was just as hard. i dont think dark souls is this hard, and it gets worse as you progress. one annoying thing is when your character gets fatigued from running he starts to pant harder than a vintage german porn flick, i guess nato must have lowered the standards in 2035. hell start panting after ~30 meter and it gets worse if you continue to run, even walking makes him sound like he a heavy smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. but dont let the single player main campaign scare you from buying the game, you can have much more fun with the editor. it takes some time to figure it out, but you can make really good missions with it. the graphics is good, but you need a very powerful pc to play it with high settings. the fps is showing when you do the changes so you dont have to exit the menu to test it. a joystick is recommended for flying the planes and helicopters. the game have a good variety of weapons, equipment and vehicles. the ballistics add a touch of realism.",184.4
"an excellent military simulator, has a large learning curve and requires patience inorder to to become skilled at. like most multiplayer games, arma 3 works alot better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination, which is a very important factor in arma 3. its fairly system intensive , but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches, but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. i would highly reccomend it, especially if you have friends to play it with.",13.5
"this title boasts some deep simulation and tactical combat dynamics. cod full of derps? riding the netcode bandwagon for battlefield 4? need something you can sink your this  is real hands into? stop thinking about it and snatch it up. 8/10 (10 being the game jesus made)",126.8
"bohemia has again come out with a great military simulation product. however, the game does have glitches and is using what some consider as an outdated engine. the game is cpu intensive, and still provides vivid graphics and an in depth user experience. i would recomend the game to anyone that would like a challange. furthermore, the community for this game does a great job of providing mods which inhance features that bohemia may have missed or ignored. pros: great game, provides a level of difficulty not seen in other fps, requires teamwork, huge map, many... many.. many unit types and vehicles, huge community, beautiful graphics. cons: the game is too difficult for some, the engine seems bumpy at times and makes the multiplayer experience frustrating at times (this does not happen all to often however) i would give it an 8 / 10 or possibly a 9 / 10 (with mods)",93.2
"personally i would put this game as m game of the year if not my game of the decade, the fact is even with its flaws, bugs and the perhaps not as optimised as it could be engine...i would still recommend this to anyone who has gotten tired of the average shooter, because this isnt one. arma has alwasy been a miliary simulator and hopefully always will be and this makes the game into something that no other first person game can top. the realism is brilliant and the combat stance mechanic is something fresh offering different ways to take cover, adding new ways to be tactical. not a fan of realism and seriousness? check the workshop and armaholic. you are bound to find something that will have you laughing, crying and having a blast. after all whats not to like about racing go-karts with heavy machine guns mounted ontop? if there was one thing that does bug me its the fact that rocks...tend to eat you sometimes if you get too close so be careful with that tl;dr version: buy the game or i will make a rock swallow you 10/10",392.1
"so far i like the game, i am not a cod fan but own many of there games, because imho cod was the best fps out till battlefield bad company 2 came out, then bf3 and now bf4 which are by far my favorite fps games. but arma series has allways had my attn. because of its mods and add ons! it truly looks as if they put allot of work into arma3 as it looks great and runs very smooth on even a cheap gaming rig where as the older games were a bit hard to run even on good hardware! i do think anyone that likes fpsers and willing to put in more than just run and gun should get this newest release, but keep in mind this is more like a simulation game than any other fps out there so most wont like it off the batt! i am running it on a older amd cpu phenom ii 970be quad core overclocked a bit and a gtx 680 classified and with some playing around got avg. fps to about 30 which is great in the arma series. i really love the story line so far and cant wait to see how far they take this game!",54.8

"i highly recommend arma 3 if youre into army games with a (high) sense of realism. you can make this game as awesome as you want yourself. depending on which (modded) gamemodes you play or with who youre playing. im part of one of the largest arma 3 clans out there (joint task force 2) and it really adds to the experience, having a tactical realism based clan. think of stuff like basic training, military rank structure, working with a chain of command, teamplay based on military tactics and manoeuvers etc. check us out over at",584.7

"the engine overhaul has been a long time coming, and there are things to love about it, but unfortunately, compared to arma 2s tight engine (albeit a bit blocky), arma iii looks plain goofy. players run around like cartoon characters, hit detections are horrendus, and the weapons and vehicles are bland and boring. speaking of items, i understand bohemias intiative to make arma iii a near-future military simulator, but these weapons and vehicles are very bad. customizations seemed promising until you realize there are only a handful of base guns, none of which will come off as familiar. the main island is much larger than any other armas setting, but it still leaves much to be desired in the department of freshness and diversity. all in all, if you are a fan of arma ii and its engine, arma iii will feel pretty alien to you. either youll get used to it, or itll always keep you from really enjoying the game. i pre-purchased the alpha on day one, and im still struggling to enjoy it to this day.",105.8

"full of vast scenery and realistic vehicles and weapons, arma 3 is a great open world tactical shooter. it is graphics hungry and even my 7970 struggles to run it well (although i havent taken to fine tuning the settings yet). the campaign was added after the release (which is weird) but its good and it helps the player in remembering the locations on the gigantic maps (like seriously stratis and altis are huge). combat is realistic (as far as i can tell), rp servers exist, coop is fluid, all in all a great game.",113.0

"arma 3 is a one of the best purchases i ever made. considering that not only you get the main game (army simulator), but you can get many more mods (for free ofc), which are so much fun. for example battle royal, which is the mod leaving you and lot of other players on a n island, where you have to find a weapon, and kill everyone else to win (basicaly same as in the movie hunger games, or battle royale). another one breaking point is the one familiar to dayz. or there is a role playing mode where you are thrown into the city, and only you choose whether you are going to be criminal, or cop, or doctor, or anyone else. thing about this game is that its engine is really open for comunity to make its own modifications of the game. this game is based on comunity, so if you are bored of regular deathmatch shooters, and want to play shooter with more realistic atmosphere and better interaction with people, there is not better game for this pupose. and if you didnt actually get what i ment by this long boring review, just google a little bit and try to find many exciting mods that exist, or are in development. shortly... if gaben gives you sale on arma iii, go for it, you wont regret the money you will spend.",21.6
"this game, strangely(?) isent just for the serious gamer. if you do know arma 3, you know im on about the editor. :p the editor i say is just there for those who rlly arent serious and want to enjoy the game anyway. you can make the most funny sceaniros sometimes, like a go-kart road trip :p or a submarine tour. for both serious or not serious gamers. :d get it.",12.2

"are you thinking about biuying this ?? keep reading!! i have been playing military simulators since operation flashpoint, and i`m really in love with the arma series and in my honest opinion there is nothing out there better. if you like a more arcadeish experience just get cod, however if you`re into your realism not kids games, get this!! did you like arma 2 ? then this game is that but better, you got rag doll physics and more life like animations, the modify shooting postions is groundbreaking imho and was a massive upgrade compared to previous installments. yes this game has bugs, but the game covers them up beautifully imho.",29.8
