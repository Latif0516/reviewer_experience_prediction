"i was really disappointed with the previous football manager (2014) so i couldnt bring myself to pay out of my own wallet for it this year. i got this as a gift for christmas and thought you know what, lets give sports interactive another chance. i started as unemployed and took the morcambe job in the middle of the season, i spent the best part of an hour and a half setting up training, bringing in coaches, creating a good tactic and getting to know my squad. within 20 minutes of my first match my keeper catches a lazy effort from 30 yards out, only to turn around stroll back into his own net with the ball clutched in hands. quit game, uninstall.",9.3
"problems with the ***** steam! i purchased the game and i havent played it yet!!!",184.7
"while this game brings the level of detail to new levels, it still begs the same of question of, when have you won, when are you at the end, and thus you always end up walking away when you realise there is no natural conclussion.",164.3
"6 hours into this game, and i must admit, they really improved the game, a lot. game looks better, and feels better with the new layout, and the in-game matches are much more fluent, and nice-looking, compared to the earlier match engines. i usually spent 500 hours+ each year on football manager games, and this will be no different. game looks massively good, runs perfect, even though i have a huge database with 13 countries, and 34 leagues. well done, si. update: i am now 36 hours into the game, and i stand by my original review. the game is amazing, and really addicting, and thus far i havent really experienced any bugs. fantastic game.",210.9
"if you love to build or put together things - like teams - than avoid this game because its fckn addictiv!",480.2
"its awesome! as long as si fixes the known bugs then it will be legendary!! hope they keep pro-active and updates often!",458.9
"this game is extremely bad. never play it. its broken and unfair. thank you.",297.5
"ive bought every football manager game after the big split and a fair few champ man ones before that. have to say im slightly disappointed by this years offering. very little of interest has been added. sure more conversations to be had but the quickly boil down to the same six or seven answers yourre always giving. the management style is fun but quickly seems pointless and gaining the licenses if little more that a tick box exercise. the engine does look better and although far from perfect the board interaction is more detailed but with the bugs still there. what has to be the most annoying part for me though is the amount of time the game wants you to do basic hr work. from the exciting world or contact negotiations to micro managing every action your apparently half witted staff carry out is long winded. its made even more annoying by the fact your backroom staff rarely follow you and often the first few weeks at a new club (admittedly usually lower league for me) is spent waiting to get a assistant manager before being able to do anything at your new club. all in all its more of the same and the updates are enough to keep me interested.i hope that more effort is but into making the game more fun for those of us who like played 10/20 seasons into the future. more interesting press conferences with much more answer variety and maybe the ability to negotiate not just a move for you but your whole backroom staff. its a begrudging yes vote from me but hopefully with improvements in the future.",944.6
"i have always been a fan of fm since the days of cm therefore i may sound biased. good: its another new version of the fm series that have grown from strength to where they are right now. the fact is that championship manager and fifa manager are no more in the market shows how strong the monopoly fm has on football management games. bad: the crash dumps are very frequent. so i have to resort to saving the game before every game. (i hope that my save game never get corrupted.) overall, this is akin to an addiction to crack cocaine. you will just keep buying it every time it comes out. the painful part is that how do you start all over again if you are very deep in your game. (im looking at you fm 16.)",752.6
"only got this game yesterday and can i just say wow, always thought of getting footal manager but thought it not going to be to much different to fifa career mode, i am so wrong the levels of depth in the game is amazing, ive problerly played quite a few hours and have only played 3 competitive games so far it takes a long time to set up and manage the team but will be worthwhile soon must reccomend this game 10/10",8.8
"in every game 1-3 player gets injured. this game kicks your nut sacks as long till you want to play a totally different game. long winning streaks followed by long losing streaks. even the league bottom dwellers hits you with 6-0. too many goals (4-5 on average). horrible execution tackles inside penalty areas almost never leads to a penalty shot. but penalties come from errors which you cannot even see. fm15beta is faulty as hell. good job si! ok, this is beta, but it has to be a totally different game on next friday, when the official release date is. best goal : my goalie was called by referee. goalie walked there and received an yellow card. then my goalie started jogging towards his work place and meanwhile the opponent gave their corner kick and scored an empty netter. rather play fm13. beyond earth and this pre-purchased and regret both. never again a pre-purchase. not. even. one.",460.3
"i have absolutely no regret for buying this game! although it is quite difficult to start with for some people, it takes considerable time to delve deeply enough into this game before you can get the hang of it but the rewards are far more than you can expect! as for me i totally love this game and i would encourage every football fan to try it and give it a fair shot. you wont be disappointed in most cases!",363.4
"fantastic game,so addictive.managed to win championship title with norwich city,now doing ok in the premiership.wish neil adams could manage norwich as well as i have.think its time for me to take over as manager of norwich in real life.",103.4
"enjoying the new layout, although its taking a little longer than i expected to adjust. the game does seem to be a bit harder than 2013 and 2014, which is good.",122.9
"ooohh, guys! i havent seen enough of 3d match and playing to criticize injuries but tactical window is really awfull. i am playing fm for three years and learned a lot of hints that use but i cannot cast overall team picture, first of all it regarding player roles. team in tactics window looks like a heap of scrap, i failed to set up player roles through it. new image of correspondece skills and position needs to measure with a scale, it very uninformative. second, tactics windows on a match. on my 15 display i see only part of player skills when try to find him optimal role. its very very uncomfortably. dear developers, please fix it on the next patch but early will be better. reccomendation is advance. curse of fm that before third path - game is really different to play. good luck, we trust in you!",543.3
"match engine is very poor. spend so much time working to build a decent squad and to develop tactics that work only for it to be entirely spoiled by the way this game treats me. too many injuries, too many goals, morale crumbles at the slightest thing, players do not follow instructions, goalkeepers are pitiful, poor animations, players are overly stroppy, long saving times. this is a video game - game being the operative word. i dont really care if this is as realistic as it gets. id sacrifice realism if the game was fun, but its not. fm 2014 was poor too. im still hoping a patch will deal with some if not all of these issues, but part of me knows it wont. goodbye 20 years of loyalty to si. these things are too expensive for me to spend money on if theyre not enjoyable.",404.7
"man alive there is a lot of goals and injuries in this game. the match engine makes your players look like theyre skating on ice. most my games finish 5-3. 4-3 etc. if im down 2-0 at half im not all that worried cause theres a chance i might score 4 goals in the 2nd half. i hope they fix some of these issues in the january update.",51.6
"bought fm since 06 and have to say this feels more like an arcade version. the new ui is awful and getting used to things again is time wasting. why try fix something that wasnt broke. theres a reason we went from side bar to top bar in previous versions of fm. the option to change from side bar to top bar isnt there either. last buy of fm for me i think.",5.8
"shocking ! the game always fails to load ! either steam or football manager need to fix the problem !",9.6
"this is way better than football manager 14, where you had to get a perfect start for your club or get sacked within a couple of months! ive played so many games and havent been sacked by cellino yet.",157.3
"every other game has the least 6 goals, why?? just finished a 6-5 vs liverpool and won the epl with a 10-4 vs spurs. what the hell? oxlade and giroud scored 5 goals each. how is this realistic?",251.7
"this game is very good, its much better than the previous years, it seems a lot more technical, and your decisions as a manager, have more effect on your team and the game in general, i love the idea of being able to edit your manager stats, attacking, defence ect, its really good and its nice to be able to view them and use them in training, if anyone needs a question answered, id be happy to help :) overall, ill give the game 9/10 - reason being, is that its only the beta version, but i cant see there being much changed for the full version in a few days time (7th november) thank you for yet another, great game!",210.4
"i am a big fan of the fm franchise and this game is just as good as the others",324.6
"i love this game and have been playing it for around 12 years. although i do enjoy this version there is still alot wrong with it. the game day match engine is just not good enough and if it doesnt improve they should just revert back to the old days of watching circles run around the pitch. the stats for your manager at the beginning mean nothing as i won promotion with sheffield wednesday and the following season i was outside the relegation zone and looking like staying up (my objective was to fight against relegation) and they still sack me. additional to this i was making the team money. this has happened to me twice with two seperate teams. the stats i choose at the beginning were for a top manager and there is no way a team in that situation in real life would sack a top manager in that position. the top clubs sign all the best players but these players would not be happy to be sat on the bench and not playing games at all, just not realistic). and the amount of injuries i am faced against, at one point i had 8 of my first team players out for 2 months or more. like i said i do like the game though and will continue to play the gaem. i just hope our comments are heard and the game next year is better than ever and back to its origins at the top of the pile for its genre.",163.8
"ive already bought the game. but when i go onto steam i cant load the game up. does anyone know what i can do",177.8
"great game. veteran player of football manager series and i feel this game lives up to the football manager reputation. i got it at christmas time so missed reported bugs that now mainly seem to be fixed. as ever match engine can be tweaked to make it better but overall football manager 2015 will provide many hours of fun.",111.0
"the game is not perfect, we all know it. the match engine is not perfect, we all know it. sometimes defender just decided to fall asleep and let the opponent stiker alone and score. sometimes the opposition goalkeeper becomes a god and saves all thats been thrown at him. there will be frustration, i guarantee it. but we still love this game, because this is football manager!!!",174.1
"some improvements here and there, but generally a step backwards. in game engine sucks, players get hurt constantly and even the in-game editor i paid 5 bucks for isnt working at the moment. a buggy mess and i hope to get some value out of the purchase after they finally fix their issues.",126.4
"overall, fm15 is a good game. different from fm14, providing different tactics and new ways of training. there are also some improvements regarding press conferences, they are shorter compared to fm14 and the question variety is greater. touchline team talks was also a good addition and the overall general layout is technically easier than fm14. saying that though, if you are an experienced fm player be prepared to take a while to get used some minor details, such as making a player avaliable to the under 21 squad is under the development tab instead of a squad tab. the 3d match engine is slightly better, however sometimes the goalkeepers do not behave like real goalkeepers in the 3d match engine. not diving, sometimes the keeper slides across on his two feet to save a shot instead of diving, other than that it is an improvement. however, the game by default does not have badges or logos or many player faces, you have to download that yourself. the tactics are technically more straight foward, if your new to fm you may find them easier compare to previous fms. however, if you are experienced it will take a while getting used to the changes. to conclude, i would reccomend the game, however it is not a big improvement to 14 and it may perhaps be better to wait for 16 or wait for more updates, however if you do decide to buy it, it is still worth it.",181.5
"i choose to play man utd. so far all match are good and challenging. just won against arsenal and everton. not much injury so far.",145.0
"won the champions league, the premier league and the fa cup in the same year.................. ......with tottenham so realistic 10/10",98.1
"day 3, i am sitting here with my curtains closed, my eyes is blood-strained, i begin to channel my inner rage after that through-ball miss. i shout out in the room dammit suarez and bang my fist in the table, so my cola spills all over the table. this game is 10/10 really this game will consume your time, you might aswell say goodbye to the world as you know it. you wont be seeing your loved ones in a looooong time.",241.3
"i have played every version of this game since it came out. like any crack addict, i was compelled to buy knowing the risks. hell, i even upgraded my pc just so i could play the game properly because the last two incarnations just wouldnt work on my battered old machine. there are always problems when it first comes out. ive found that the problems persist until a patch comes out in december/january. now for the breakdown: good - the user interface is so much better; there is more interaction with players; you can force moves out with a gentle discussion - a great innovation. bad - whats going on with the tactics? i was scoring plenty of goals, but i noticed that i was conceding far too many. maybe it was my tactical setup? so, when i went into a 3-0 lead, i decided to shore up my defence. i dropped my defenders back and even my wingers. yet, once again, i was conceding the same sort of goals - a cross into the box and finished because my full back was somewhere else or (more usually), the goalie making a save and the rebound always falling to their striker. the end result was 4-3. my stats showed i had the tallest team in the league and thus scored most from corners. however, i also conceded the most from corners. wtf?! i developed one tactic where i gave up trying to win away and just park a bus. still a 5-2 thrashing. i won the league scoring over 100 goals. i conceded more than the relegated teams (70). despite brilliant fitness coaches, i was losing to loads of last minute goals. why, god, why?! i love this game and always will, but to get most enjoyment, ill wait until the patch.",317.2
"while no significant changes since fm2014, its a worthy improvement, especially with the new ui. some of the earlier issues have been addressed by the latest updates but still the defensive / crossing aspect of the game engine seems rather flawed. also the motivational man management of the squad can be rather annoying to deal with, its just a matter of learning the best responses to the relevant question. scouting has been much improved (in terms of realism) over recent incarnations of the franchise. worth buying but not an essential purchase 7/10.",257.5
"great game if this is what you are into, football club simulator basically at its core. when you get into it you keep wanting to see what happens after the next match. wish i had more time to play",82.5
"eventhough there are not huge improvements with the 2014 version, there are always improvements. if you can afford it, do it.",206.2
"regarding a lot of these negeative reviews, i honestly do not know what game people have been playing. the new side bar is a massive improvement to fms accessability. each core page is now much easier to access, freeing up space for a large search bar to instantly find any player, cup or competition in the games database. the new report page is excellent. it is now as clear as it can be what the pros and cons of each player are, making it even easier to scout the perfect player for your team in a given situation. as for the match engine, it keeps getting better and better each year and fm 2015 marks a big step forward with motion capture animations added to the mix. how anyone can play in 2d when the engine quality has improved so dramatically since its implementation is beyond me. fm 2015 is the biggest leap forward in the series for the past 2-3 years.",244.9
"where do i start? well it should be called football impoter not football manager ok i started my managing career with a very poor team, but with this mental match engine i have racked up 52 goals in 17 games conceeding 24 alomg the way.....i am some how top of the table even tho i sold my best players. the gk are just well, there is just no words for them! 30 yards belters from cb`s are a common thing, defending is just brutal. i don`t have one good thing to say about this game. i have over 400+ hrs on 11, 12, 13 and 14......now to top it all off it says i have to purshase the game again!!!! 2 out of ten for me.....if the fotball on the pitch is no good then whats the point of the updated interface",153.6
"this game sucks! in the match mode players will just stand and let the opposition get the ball. goalkeepers will let the ball slip through them, not just once but this happens virtually every game, which it just wouldnt in the premier leauge. defenders just dont tackle and let players run past them. whatever good work si have done in the past few years has been un-done by this abomination!",268.0
"ive played every single football manager game since the split from championship manager and every single championship manager before that and i have to say, this is the first time ive been massively disapointed in the series - it doesnt feel like fm, its a skewed imposter. some things around the game has improved in subtle ways - match day stadiums looks great, the scouting is more realistic than ever but the good ends there. the matchday engine has slowly become a joke over the years, tolerable but still worsening for the past 3 editions, this one being the worst. injuries are through the roof in this version (even after the hotfix tweaks) and its impossible to keep a players fitness up even with squad rotation. in addition to the injuries the goals are insane your team will score 100 goals a season with anichebe as your main attacking threat but youll also concede just as many with neuer as your keeper. tactics dont seem to matter all that much, after testing it seems the main factor is your familiarity with it. if its low youll drop easy wins without question as your defenders refuse to perform any type of tackle. in all i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone in its current state and i really hope si throw out some massive fixes/improvements and soon.",79.7
"this game follows in its predecessors footsteps and adds ne features!",63.5
"i hope the game include full game packs so we dont donlot to another sites..",51.6
"why you no work?? bought the disk, not the steam download, what a shocker it is not working. disgraceful for a game that has been running like this for so long!",388.3
"this game its to easy.........its totally disapointted.... i prefer fm 2014 than 2015. i thought its gonna be great game......... but its not...............damn",120.8
"based on beta - played all games since day 1 and most have had there issues but then its very hard to wipe out all problems with such a variation of methods. nothing i would class as gaming breaking occured and any issues with 3d engine can generally be ignored or altered tactics wise to suit. easily the best and most comprehensive version thus far, much improvement to gui, scouting etc and requires more patience when lower league. think all the changes are for the better and enjoying new challenge of working out all the new nuances and mechanics.",606.5
"this game keeps having serious errors which crash the game and delete my save completly!!!! getting really annoying and theyre contact department are never any help. massive fan of the franchise but this years effort is poor on the system",320.3
"if you buy it. you should buy more all item in game. it so badddddddddd so now i need to sell this game not make me fun at all",292.8
"unplayable, its seruously bugged, please sort out asap. im on a mac and my friend has it on pc, it looks like two different games, block of black all over the screen, and now when i load it up its has the eula agreement which it wont let me agree to, so i cant play the game. i thought there was a point to alpha and beta realeases? worst 30 ive ever spent.",6.5
"great fm game has some issues which get sorted out soon anyway but its fun as hell",70.8
"really enjoying the game right now, i like starting with a lower league team and rising them up to the top league. im currently playing as stoke after being offered a job there because i promoted york city to the championship! loads of possibilities, my only issue is that there should be some fmc features in the normal fm mode apart from that good game.",38.4
"nice game .. after not playing this game since 2008",685.1
"football manager 2015 is a manager simulation game which is designed to put you in charge of teams within the footballing world. you can buy/sell as you please as well as hire/fire staff as you please and you ride the highs and lows of football management. if youve played the older versions of this game this game is a slight improvement upon them. this version has added extra features and improvements which most are very much in the background. truth be told the same issues with the preivous versions still exist in this version to a certain extent, such as the ai (at times in rare cases) is very frustrating and downright poor. ai issues have been adressed in the latest update, but much like many other games the orignal version was released unfinished/unpolished. much like the fifa franchise this game slightly improves elements such as graphics and adding one or two features which in my opinon is unacceptable there is alot of potentail and the creators should look to improve much more (such as the match engine and overall media/player interaction). to be more positive the game is fun, challengeing and does feel like an improvement the match engine is getting better and the accuracy of transfers between clubs is better, however the next version must have significant improvement in order to prevent the franchise from becoming stale. for football fans who enjoy the small details involed with football and would ratrher be at the helm of a club rather than a player this game is for you. overall an addictive game and a slight improvement and a solid edtion to a franchise with high potential. 6/10 (upon release) 8.5/10 (latest update).",258.3
"apparently someone who makes the match engine died because the whole ing thing is a disaster. the most realistic football simulation game offers realistic scorelines such as 7-3, 6-2, and ive even seen an 8-8 draw. defending is non existent. goalkeepers take about 10 minuites to get up after they make a save and the whole thing is just broken. i lost 5-0 when my team had 15 shots 6 on target and they had around 5 shots 3 on target. 2 of them were own goals and the rest were rebounds from the keeper. if you call that realistic i have no idea what league you are looking at. i hate when people say its your tactics; ive tried every tactic possible just to get some results and nothing works. i started about 3 saves now. i like the new layout and the game mechanics. but the match engine is godawful and unfinished to the point where i question if its a football game. why the  is the match engine so bad when it was amazing on fm14? go back to 14 everybody where you can get realistic scorelines. tl;dr , nobody can score, nobody can defend, goalkeepers are apparently disabled. dont buy it until a patch comes out.",386.4
"the lights flick on. your hands and feet are bound to the bed posts. its didier drogba standing over you, full mast, ready to have his way. you contemplate the vicious cycle of love and abuse. its no use, youre hooked even against your better judgement. perhaps hell be gentle this time, let you feel something positive, give you something to hold on to. something that feels good again. he used to say he loved you. he used to care. i need help...",85.7
"brilliant game. the best manager simulation out there at the minute. however, i feel it gets a bit boring after a few seasons - just my opinion.",707.9
"awesome game, love it! just wish there was more variety in the workshop. the game needs alot of things, like the kits, logos, etc. but still an amazing game to play alone or with friends.",94.0
"the best game out right now. whether it be conquering the ancient world, colonizing a map or planet, winning a world war, or dominating your fictional baseball league; this simulation/strategy for some reason has always been and continues to be more fun and better. if you arent a soccer fan yet, it is only because you havent played this.",87.9
"fm used to be a great football manager, now it has become a great kindergarden manager, if that is what you are looking for. trying to keep footballers happy will either drive you insane or push you towards the ultra-vanilla classic mode. i wouldnt mind a slightly less realistic game if it was slightly more enjoyable to play.",448.6
"game was released yesterday - i have 34 hours playing time on record. wenger calls me names, mourinho calls me names, martinez calls me names, my girlfriend calls me names. best spreadsheet software to date.",247.3
"wont be buying football manager 16 as this game is on another level such as price you have to pay for players it can be up 2000% there value, wingers run and gradually slow down then are tackled and if a ball goes over the line it is a goal but according to football manager thats not a goal and what is it with clubs not having the badge plus cup logos and kits all ready included if i pay 30 pound for a game i want the game to have the club logos and cup logos and real names many many thing needed to be improved the acutual 3d game when watched is nothing like football a child could tell that 5/10 need serious improvement to match the price p.s sicki baba",152.3
"fantastic game. goes into incredible detail. this game is the definition of addicting cannot stop playing. a must have for any soccer/football fan",41.2
"great game. have been playing since the 98/99 days of championship manager and always find the money to buy on release day. better and better year on year, a credit to the sports simulation world! keep it going si games!",317.5
"great game, doing this for the steam achievement. but its so good to play on long flights/train and a welcome break from fifa 15",67.8
"--- below is my original review, but i have changed it from recommended to not recommended, because even after patching, the game and match-engine is unrealistic; how could the programmers not realise this? i regret buying it and have gone back to fm14.--- this game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, though it does have its problems. id definitely recommend this to fans of the series. lets go through the pros and cons: pros: - i like the new ui, i think its improved on previous titles, with things like scouting/transfers in more logical places - it runs smoother: you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match; instead it takes less than 2 seconds. this means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time. - i havent seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries; its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me. -player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved cons: - weirdly takes longer to save than fm14. over a minute and a half for me. - the games are too high scoring, and this needs to be patched for realism purposes. i just had 5 games that were 6-3, 6-3, 5-3, 0-0 (lol) and 6-3 again... a bit silly... - goalkeepers are pretty bad, hence the high scores. - it feels like its harder to play a possession game, but that might be just because im leicester. its a fun game; im definitely glad i bought it. good for fans of the series; if patched it could be brilliant. they say theyve solved the issue of too many fks going in, but they dont seem to have",88.9
"as of right now i have to give this version a bad review, first time ever giving fm a bad one. playing in my second season and for 2 seasons in a row i have had more than half my team injured. i tried everything from reducing training to even minimal training. i wouldnt buy this game unless it goes up for atleast 50% off.",25.5
"people should learn the game before crying about it... if the way you used to do things dont work maybe its time to do it differently instead of crying about it. i like it, im happy with it. new scouting system is awesome",507.0
"ive purcahsed every football maanger since 2011 and i have to say this one is unplayable! the amount of injuries which as far as i can tell they dont plan on fixing is rediculous. i wont be opening this game again and going back to football manager 14",335.0
"tunnel interviews............ :d nothing more needs to be said currently. ill review further after sleep and sustinence.",816.2
"im a addict have been for years and it just keeps getting better and better",775.1
"still not realistic considering what you see on the pitch. but still, the best manager game there is by far.",221.2
"i wouldnt recommend buying this game until a few patches are released. the release version is full of bugs, especially the match engine, that makes it almost unplayable. i mean, sure, you can play it, but you just have to cringe at all the goals scored from obvious match engine bugs. at this point, 50% of goals are scored from crosses on the wing that your defenders just dont contest, 30% scored from set pieces, 10% scored on missplaced backpasses to the keeper and 10% for the rest. the defense and goalie are so terrible most matches end with 4+ goals scored. if you want to win, just make sure you have wingers who like to hug the touchline and cross the ball instead of cutting inside should have expected it really, it is the first time i buy fm right on the release date.",251.6
"can someone help me i have just payed for football manager 2015 the belt vertion dose that mean its not the real game what is coming out in november or will it update it self",237.3
"the beautiful game just ot a make over. after playing the series for a number of years now, i was expecting the same thing. yet it seems so much improved on things i didnt even know needed improving. 1 example is the competitions menu. it shows where you are in the league and cups. the staff are more helpful and i like the introduction to tunnel interviews. the 3d graphics now involve motion capture in them and look much improved. 1 thing that is really noticeable is tweaking a system. example, my false 9 striker was not getting any goals but i was winning games. i change him to poacher and he gets bucket loads. if you love football and you love the idea of managing your fave team, get this, its a no brainer.",189.5
"minor change, but still fun. so many bad review, its $30, what do you expect guys?",498.4
"i thought people were overreacting about the number of injuries... boy was i wrong",291.8
"my players are stuck on international duty and dont return help please",362.3
"well in my opinion this is by far the best football manager to date. the graphics on the 3d match are really good the gameplay seems alot smoother goalkeepers actually make really good saves. ive seen alot of people moaning about the beta version what you all need to understand is the whole point of this is so any problems that do occor you let them no they fix it and to be fair there are a few faults. 1. theres way to many injuries within pre season. 2. theres been to many times when the ball is in the box and the strikers or defence dont really do anything about it too many realistic goalscoring chances missed. 3. ridiculous transfer fees i no in fm14 it was the same but it seems unless you have 40 million to spend on one half decent player then you aint getting a half decent player. theres a few more things but i reckon the developers will fix all this before the game is actually released so im not worried. its well worth the money and if your a die hard football manager player then once this little things are fixed youll love it.",272.3

"i love football manager! this 2015 edition is still addictive and i personnaly really like the new ui which is a lot easier to use than the old way (in my opinion). lets be honest though, if you have already played fm13 or fm14, you are mainly purchasing minor improvements and updated teams with fm15, a bit like the fifa/pes games.",110.7
"i cant recommend this game despite it improving in many ways from previous versions. the reason for this is the focus on player interaction this year. players have always got unhappy for not getting enough game time, too much competition etc. this year not only does this happen more frequently but often without any justification. you then get to try to talk them round which almost always ends in half the squad becoming unhappy. at this point team morale is very low (meaning you lose a lot) and the only way to turn this around is to try and sell most of the team before you get sacked. hopefully si will fix this in the next patch.",647.6
"while presenting an extremely innovative and immersive experience of the football management appeal, it leaves gamers who are unfamiliar or rookie to the sport in the dark. though the game is of high appeal to those who are well versed in the world of english football, one could easily advise those who are unfamiliar to steer away; this game is not for novices. this isnt to say that this lack of equality is a detraction from the game itself - quite the opposite - for those seasoned in english football, the game provides a beautiful experience for the hotseat of game management and requires extremely detailed choices for all aspects of the job in order to ensure success both on the field and off.",11.2
"its still the classic football manager, but.... the new interface just inst quite as intuiative as the old. some good new features but a few bad. perhaps i need time to get used to it, but i have had to look some things up to work out how to do them. there is definate room for improvement. not too sure about the role you play as a coach either but that might develop.",3.8

"the game is fine in the long term, but the buggy match engine and the tons of injuries are so annoying... my goalkeeper makes a great save and parries it. you would think he would want to get that ball as soon as possible. nope. he takes forever to get up, leaving the opposistion to just tap it in. my wingers keep cutting inside then howling it into row z at least 5 times a match. i have my highlights set to key so when i see memphis depay cut inside, i get all pumped up, and then, nope, he kicks it out of the stadium. the injuries are also annoying. sure its realistic, but every pre season i end up with at least 5 key players getting injured before the opening match of the season. it gets better as the season goes along, and i know its because of low match fitness in pre season, but its stupid. this needs to be fixed. there are some positives though. the scouting and coaching is a lot better than in previous fms, and the transfers are also realistic. the only problem with the transfers is that all the youth players want the same deal and they wont budge at all unless i give them 20k a week. i would recommend this game to a first time fm player, but not if you have previous fms, just stick to them and not buy this buggy game.",118.3

"--- below is my original review, but i have changed it from recommended to not recommended, because even after patching, the game and match-engine is unrealistic; how could the programmers not realise this? i regret buying it and have gone back to fm14.--- this game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, though it does have its problems. id definitely recommend this to fans of the series. lets go through the pros and cons: pros: - i like the new ui, i think its improved on previous titles, with things like scouting/transfers in more logical places - it runs smoother: you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match; instead it takes less than 2 seconds. this means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time. - i havent seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries; its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me. -player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved cons: - weirdly takes longer to save than fm14. over a minute and a half for me. - the games are too high scoring, and this needs to be patched for realism purposes. i just had 5 games that were 6-3, 6-3, 5-3, 0-0 (lol) and 6-3 again... a bit silly... - goalkeepers are pretty bad, hence the high scores. - it feels like its harder to play a possession game, but that might be just because im leicester. its a fun game; im definitely glad i bought it. good for fans of the series; if patched it could be brilliant. they say theyve solved the issue of too many fks going in, but they dont seem to have",88.9
"interface lag ruins it for me. also, sometimes i feel as if ive been fifaed with the whole 35 shots, 19 on target for your team against 3 shots 1 on target and you lose 1-0 or my personal favorite, 35 shots, 19 on target for your team and 2 shots, 2 on target for the opposition and you lose 2-1. alot of really enjoyable aspects to the game including the engine. still rather hoping for further upgrades in that department. the sim aspect is wonderful though.",385.4
"they have truly delievered one of the best fms games this year. i recommend this game strongly for football fans with wild passion and love for the game, you will not be dissapointed and will instantly love this game. 10/10.",410.1
"instead of getting the core of the game right: tactics, match engine, we get yet another load of new press interactions that nobody cares about and even more dumb talks with players and teams. sure you can get your assistants to do it but some players actually likes talkes to press and staff as long as its not repetitive and actually has an impact? nevertheless the real problem is with the match engine: results like 3 to 5 or 4 to 4 are common, the goalkeeper stays on his line for every cross and the movements the players make in the engine are laughable. the crowd looks like a bunch of inflatable dolls in the stand and just like previous x versions there is hardly any atmosphere in terms of sound from the crowds (where have the good old sack the boss chants gone, or why cant the crowd whistle or boo at the ref?) for that crippled engine we get the amazing gift of hot dog stands outside the stadium? wow, thanks for getting your priorities straight, si. last time i bought the game (since 98/99). time for a decent competitor.",192.8

"calling football manager the best management sim out there is always a redundant statement. true as it is, its peerless excellence has chased any significant rivals away. but the biggest task is tempting players away from their carefully built career in the previous game. sports interactive know that its games biggest competition remains itself and, as you may tell your team at halftime, they must guard against complacency. fm15s changes tend to contribute to gentle improvement rather than startling disruption, but should do enough to tempt you into starting that managerial journey all over again.",56.6
"have been playing fm since 2012 so i am no way a newbie to this game. my 2 cents so far.. 1. too many bugs in match engine, laggy, lousy ui. gameplay is not realistic at all. amount of long shots, unrealistic angles, number of goals, ball physics, everything is a big letdown. 2. add to that licensing issues (fm should state in bold that fm 2015 does not have licence for players faces/ team logos/jerseys) . this was shambolic and adds one more level of unrealism. i could go on rambling about it .. in short fm 2015 disappoints me every level. practically a downgrade from fm 2014.",120.6

(it is not a bug its a feature)..... dont get me started with the freekicks! if your player has a higher rating then 1 i freeking you will score if it is nearer then 90 meters from the goal! oh i forgot about the demands from the players. i played my first season as brndby and 8... eight ing players demanden to be sold. that was devestating for the morale of the team, but come on! i cannot sell 8 players in one transfer period! at the end of every season do some different players demand to get sold, and they get angry, and so do the rest of the guys, if you do not let them accept an offer. not just any offer ooooh no, but a offer from the last transfer period. that is just plain stupid. you cannot sell a player in a closed marked! the game sucks bigtime. it is harder then ever, so even if you plays manchester united against bradford, you still are up for a huge chalenge! dont buy this game! its a mess and not worth the money! stay with fm14 i know i will undtil most of the bugs are fixed!",401.8

"the best football manager game since fm11. all hail fm developers :d",350.9
"this game is highly reccommended by me. 100% buy. the game has had a huge improvement from 2014 and the game has come a long way since it first started. 1 huge feature that they have improved is the way your team listen your advice and it can actually make a difference in your. new features making it a more realistic manager simulator. the wide range of players and team availabe and giving you a chance to choose how much of an experienced manager you are. this is a must buy to big football manager fans and dont be dragged into it being a copy of last years version. to me it is a huge improvement from 2014. must buy!",86.5

"i want to like it. really, i do. but im struggling for a variety of reasons... the new interface is nice, ill give it that. but when you sign three new players in preseason and it injures all of them in a friendly you start to think its gonna go badly, and then it does. the game is just so hateful, a fresh injury every game, keepers fumbling the ball into their own net in the last minute against bottom of the league, a 5* striker who couldnt hit a barn door from two yards, half the squad whinging because i sold a terrible 16 year old fullback for a million quid... the list goes on. ill persevere a while yet, hopeful that itll improve, maybe theyll update the match engine and give me a chance. but if they dont, ill go back to fm14 and write this off as 30 wasted.",175.0

"i started a season with man utd and i have constantly been picking up injuries. ive not once had anywhere near a full strength team and falcao even got injured for 6 months. it seems im picking up two injuries a game. other than that the game is very good. the scouting in particular has been greatly improved. on previous versions of fm it almost seemed too easy to find amazing players and judge who was going to be the next big thing. now a lot less players appear when searching for transfers, meaning youll have to send your scouts out to other leagues and teams to gather information. theyve also added the option to scout an individual player for serveral months with more indepth scouting reports. if youre already big into fm and have played previous versions i think its a big enough update from 14 to be worth purchasing and for those whove never played it, the way that si have arranged their tabs and generally neatened up and simplified the layout of the game makes fm 15 the most accesible for a while.",122.9

"having played every version of football manager back to the heydays of championship manager on the amiga, purchasing every year without regret as i always get my moneys worth. they changed the layout for the better this year and did the usual tweaks and as ever it has took a few patches but the game plays as well as ever. highlight for me has been the scouting tweak, made me think how best to get the info i need on players and as in real life the best way is to watch them and also have they come in on trial. its a small thing but that is what makes football manager worthy of purchase each year, all the small thngs that make one great thing. off to don the sheepskin and see what dreams can be acheived.",237.3

"ive only put in about 20 hours (not much considering its the fm series) in the beta so far, but i just feel that i have to counter these complaints about the game engine being worse. for the first time since fm09, i feel that the game engine has improved from last year. im not experiencing these random results at all, and the goals that are scored are can almost everytime be traced to a tactical flaw or strength, as opposed to fm14 where that percentage wouldve been about 50. im not experiencing this whole thing with vast amounts of goals being scored/conceded either, nor the comeback issue people have been reporting. i feel like these issues sound like typical beta issues (remember, it is a beta youve been playing) that will be resolved quickly, but will see. either way, im good. corners have been improved, where tactics and player attributes actually make a difference for once, and it is now finally possible to score on free kicks and longshots again (it was of course possible before - but not even the best players in the world would even be close to a realistically decent conversion rate).",25.5
"i play fm since the 2008 version, and this version has serious problems in relation to reality of the game. matches with a lot of goals and many players injuring easy make this version the worst view of the fm series. among the positive points, unfortunately, can only say an improvement in direct negotiations between players and clubs.",615.3

"the sidebar is welcome. generally the screen layouts have been much improved. however the match engine feels like a bit of a backward step, although i understand that its early days for the motion-capture route their taking. the one thing that drives me mad the most is the sound of ball being kicked; a noise happens every time a player kicks the ball, even if its a mere tap a foot a head of them. this is most fustrating during intra-squad friendlies when there is no crowd noise to ease the pain.",119.5

"bought this game after the december update and regarding the problems many other customers have complained about below i have to say after four full months of the first season i havnt had any problems with crazy amounts of injuries and the match engine is not producing crazy results. its not a perfect game, i think if the developers spent more time and effort on it then the game could be what it should be in the year 2015 after the 23 years of product development time theyve had since i first played cm on my amiga 500 back in the day, not to get to long winded - in my opinion its the best version ive played yet but it should have been this good in 2001. pros - steam workshop, fast gaming experience relative to previous versions, lots of options, not neccessarily overly complicated, match engine is capable of the beautiful game at times and does manage to elicit strong emotions in me, did i mention steam workshop? cons - gks sometimes go mindless for a few seconds in match engine leading to fantasy breaking silly goals this happens maybe once every three games, -having to always watch the kick offs and final whistle highlights in match engine even if nothing interesting happens, -about once a game in the match engine a pointless highlight will show and last too long even though nothing interesting is happening.",41.5
"i have had football manager since 2010, enjoyed playing iit greatly for years. i enjoyed the ability to micromanage the little things in the game mainly the sliders. if my team was getting scored on a great deal move thedefensive line slider back a few notches of which i had twenty. a few years ago they decided to do away with the sliders but keep them optional to simplify the game. fine i still have them... the last few years completly gone, and its obvious to anyone who plays the game that the system is exactly the same, the player and team instructions are still moving sliders in the background. so i am at the point where i am just not interested in the game anymore, i am sure there are people out there that like to tinker and micromanage their games, people that enjoy games like europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2. football manager has been one of my favorite games i hope they can listen to their fans and bring back what we all loved about the game.",42.7

"its decent installment again but nothing much is new. i paid 35 bucks for this and just upgraded from the beta to the full game and i dont notice a single difference... everything still is as shady as in the beta :( this just wont stand... it means theyve probably had this game ready for ages since the changes are just graphical mostly and want to hussle us as much as they can. of course the engine / card / injury system is messed up on launch as usual too ffs why do i keep falling for their scummy tricks... i cant recommend anyone buying this now, get it for 15-20 bucks and after a few patches and maybe then its a decent update. (had to choose thumbsdown until the state of the game changes, then my review might change too) edit: just got a crash dump error for the second time as well, im done with this till they patch it, back to fm14 it is sigh :( edit #2: the only thing fixed are the crash dumps, i no longer get crashes but the match engine is still so random and terrible that i dont even want to play no more. edit 3: 20/12/2014: almost winter and this game is still a mess, you can lose to the number 18 of the league with your best eleven and then 3 days later win against a stronger opponent with your b-squad for no reason at all. si should be ashamed of themselves.",443.5
"its wierd at first and the default skin is terrible but after a few hours into it you start to get used to it. scouting is actually allot more important than ever now and you go into your scouting tab in order to search for players that are transfer listed etc, based on your scouting knowledge. you can see how everything is working allot more now and makes it important to have feeder clubs from different countries to improve scouting knowledge across the globe. touchline instructions are cool in theory but i found it to be pointless and makes your team worse off, just stick with the pre match and half time team talks. match engine is allot better and it feels more fluid with the animations however are there some dodgy stuff that happens especially when 2 or 3 defenders are trying to chase down a loose ball then none of them end up getting it and leave it whilst a surging striker latches onto it and scores when they shouldent of had any chance of getting it. the only bad thing really for me is the default skin but thats a personal thing, as for the game its solid and a solid upgrade. if youve not got a fm game for a while then deffo pick this up, if you get them every year then you should see more improvements this year than you have the previous years to warrent getting it aswell.",314.4

"i have loved this game series for years, and preordered the new one, and even though i would reccomend it, it is slightly bizarre... loads of goals, loads of injuries, loads of yellow/red cards, and sometimes you go on losing streaks that are unrealistic and absolutely impossible to get out of. i finally managed to get ahead in a game and one of my players was sent off so i lost. it sort of seems like they want to make it as difficult as possible. they just need to tone it all down a little bit, and it should be fine. i mean, one player i was against scored 4 in the first half. i mean liverpol are bad the moment, but i think it is slightly unrealistic for abel hernandez to get 4 against me in the capital one cup in less tha 45 minutes. never mind, i can focus on the league. oh wait, it is impossible to win in it. im sure it will improve once the beta period is over.",188.4

"core experience remains the same but an upgraded match engine and a few new features make this a worthwhile addition. much like its predecessor, fm2015 is an evolution of the series rather than a revolution. this is both a bad and a good thing. the main differences between 2014 are mainly numerous small things that i will not mention here. i will mention the two things that stand out to me however. 1.) match engine: this has been in my opinion, greatly improved. matches seem to flow better, there are far more moves, goals scored seem mutch more varied and over all it makes it harder to predict the outcome of a move (something i found i could do with previous match engines due to having seen the same move over and over again). overall i think this is the best 3d match engine they have released. 2.) layout: for some reason they have decided to completly change the layout and all the menus etc. this is still p*ssing me off as the changes seem illogical and now takes me much longer to go to screens than before. i can see no reason for the change apart from for changes sake. it doesnt make things easier or quicker or more intuitive and generally just slows things down as it can take awhile to dig into sub menu after sub menu to look for the page you want. for existing fm2014 fans this may not have enough of a change to warrant a full price purchase but for players of older versions or new players i think the updated match engine do warrant the game for consideration. overall i do recommend the game as overall i find the fm series to be excellent, however note there are not a massive amount of changes compared to the last release.",119.7
"the graphics is great, it more realistic than fm 2014, the engine is great, a lot of cool stuff and great look. but it still like older fm and not quite change a lot. there are still bugs, the most thing that make me hated is the shots. in a match my team scored 18 but 9 on target and 3 goals when they shot 10, 6 on target and 5 goal. and the second thing is injury why is injury happened a lot and crazy like 6-7 months, 3-5 months, 6-7 weeks. but this game is still cool, i really like this game. if you like football and like manage football club, i recommend you to play this!!! for me this game is 7.5/10",45.3

"brillant, the same quaility as each of the last 10 editions! the userface is the best they have had, and the match engine is smoother and some of the players movement is much better! only minor problems is that it seems easier than past editions. but the game is 10/10 as ever.",471.0
"absolutely baffled by some of the negative comments about the game. ive not played fm since fm 12 so maybe the minor improvements over the years impress me more than most. i agree that the training is a liitle poor and needs work and i have only played 15 hours but overall ive found the game very good. its not outstanding like the earlier versions but it is always going to be difficult to develop it so far forward without ruining the gaming or changing it beyond recognition. so far i havent had any major issues with injuries and the match engine is fine with no silly mistakes and goals from all over the pitch. if youve not played fm for a while like myself then buy it but it appears if you have been buying it year in year out then maybe you need to take a break away from the keyboard, get some fresh air, a bit of sun and come back to it in a year or two. oh and some places sell the game for 20 which isnt a lot really.",222.9

"liking it, changes to the game are subtle and things i cant be bothered with like press and training are far too repetitive but in saying that it has it good points, the over feel of the game is good, with the new ui they have made a lot of improvments. a word to the developers, think big, rather than loads of small improvments you guys need to go for a big leap, try and give us regular customers something to get excited about, stadium design or being able to create a club from scratch in the lower leagues of a country and make it a real force over 10 seasons+. but all in all, if your a fan of the series then youll be happy with this...",260.8
"match engine is still absolutely dreadful and it looks as though its been designed by people who have never watched a football match in their entire lives, team instructions are not represented at all during the highlights (goalkeepers and defenders do the usual thing of launching long balls instead of doing short passes) and the players act like complete idiots, wingers shooting from the tighest of angles instead of squaring it to a free team mate for a tap in, training is still practically the same as the previous versions with a couple of minor tweaks that dont add anything meaningful short, medium or long term. basically dont waste your money on this, si are taking the money and having a laugh.",225.4
"will probably be the last football manager i buy, been playing since champ 01/02 and maybe ive been playing fm for too long but the game is just too easy, can take a team from league 2 to the champions league in 5/6 years almost everytime, in lower leagues you can pickup players on free transfers 2 leagues above the standard you play, in the prem you pickup players from argentina/brazil for 4m and sell them for 30m at the end of the season, not fun for me anymore",506.8

"still the best football simulator game.. after i missed the 2014 series, this 2015 series is a much improvement from 2013 series.. the most improved part is: (1) higher complexity in handling players contracts and negotiation with other clubs; as well as (2) the improved tactical variety (players role, etc). while this could be a little bit cumbersome for those who new to this series, i believe the built-in tutorial will be very useful.",99.9

"i love the game very much however there are always some concerns. these are all game play issues: 1) a few players ratings. messi is 20 everything as usual but he didnt have a great last season like he usualy does. some players are quite underrated such as di maria and a few atletico madrid players. ronaldo has 15 acceleration.... (not sure how that works.) 2) some errors made by defenders and keepers are simply unexplainable.(not sure if its a bug or not). sometimes the defenders just heads/pass the ball back towards the keeper and then the keeper just stands there making no attempt of clearing it whilst an opposition is running towards it. 3) when players dribble they run into teamates far too often. which is quite unrealistic as it hardly ever happens in real life. 4) this is a very irritating one. players misses 1v1s far too much, if they have 4-5 1v1 chances theyll manage to score one.... this is very unacceptable as in real life players in top leagues simply dont miss all those chances. you could say that they are having a bad game but its happening consistantly throughout the season. also the opposition always manage to score them when they have the chance. but our players just blast it strait at their keepers. 5) final one so far... players some how manages to score some incredible long shots but they simply just blast it over the goal when they are at the 6 yard box which is again unexplainable (sometimes it is harder to miss then to just get it on target). so far i havnt seen a single finesse shot by my players and only 1 from the opposition. please could you fix these issues. i would be forever greatful.",203.2

"i have had football manager since 2010, enjoyed playing iit greatly for years. i enjoyed the ability to micromanage the little things in the game mainly the sliders. if my team was getting scored on a great deal move thedefensive line slider back a few notches of which i had twenty. a few years ago they decided to do away with the sliders but keep them optional to simplify the game. fine i still have them... the last few years completly gone, and its obvious to anyone who plays the game that the system is exactly the same, the player and team instructions are still moving sliders in the background. so i am at the point where i am just not interested in the game anymore, i am sure there are people out there that like to tinker and micromanage their games, people that enjoy games like europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2. football manager has been one of my favorite games i hope they can listen to their fans and bring back what we all loved about the game.",42.7

"great addition to the series despite a lot of negativity towards it. the new interface is great and improves on last years version, i do agree to an extent that injuries do get a bit ridiculous towards parts of the season - my most memorable being managing wolfsburg and having 7(!) regular starters injured all within a space of 2-3 months. aside from this, everything else has been great. tactics have been spot on, i also tested a few tactics from the workshop and i was surprised at how good some of them were - but it didnt make an instant difference. some tactics took a good 5-10 games to start flowing nicely, otherwise i would find myself conceding at least 2 goals per game. this year i was focusing solely on gaining most of the achievements rather then spending my life going through season to season with my favourite team. ive been an admirer of these games since championship manager 98 and think ive purchased it every year from then. it is true that a lot of the updates could quite easily come into a nice dlc bundle or same game upgrade, however this is not the case. people should note that they are not forced to buy the game every year, their are plenty of dedicated people within the football manager community that focus on updating the databases for older game titles in order for those to keep playing the old game, with the new data. overall i have loved fm15 and am pleased to say that after all these years, sports interactive are still making good progress in providing a richer and more fulfilling football manager.",141.5

"at first i thought this game was a massive step up on fm 14 but after playing for only a few hours i have realised what a massive dissapointment this game really is, i knoiw itss only beta but so many things need changing that i cant see the end products as being that good. first of all injuries are outragious, you are guaranteed to get an injury a game and can find yourself without you key players only 4 games in to the season. second problem is the new match engine the amount of times my players have just stood there and watched charlie adams ping a 50 yard screamer in whilst my keeper does nothing is ridiculos, seriously though the ai rarely do anyting. the transfers are so unrealistic, the value of a player might be 10 million but you will end up having to pay 40 million for a decent player. finally the worst part is the inconsistency of the matches, you can go and play manchester city away and thrash the 6-0 and then lose at home to west brom 4-0 this was a problem in early fm 14 and that got soon fixed, im not saying you should win every game but the game feels too inconsistant, there isnt enough realism in matches. i have been looking forward to fm 15 for a while now and am quite dissapointed so far:( at this stage tbh i wouldt recommend fm 15 untill things have been changed, people are rating this game because i told my player i was gonnna sell him and he got upset that has been in fm for an age and isnt a real addition, there are positives of this game but not enough.",169.5

"i really love this series of games and have played fm since the 2009 edition. this time they have gone a step down in my opinion. the new layout is okay. the interface bar on the left side instead of the top is a great new thing, but from there on its just worse to be honost. the tactic section is clumsy and very few things are better and alot of things are worse. besides from that it seems like the match engine is way worse too. normally there would be some sense of stability, but now i can play as man city and win 8-0 against sporting(por) and then lose againt some 3rd division team 3-6 in the next match. theres an unbelieveable amount of injuries which is so damn frustrating. the search engine has got a makeover that is for the better, although i seem to have a problem finding young players from outside europe without making the leagues playable. all in all a turn for the worse, but most of the problems could be solved with some updates and maybe a choice to chose the old tactics interface (please??). at this very moment i would not recommend it, but as mentioned it could be very recommendable if some fixes come soon. over and out. christian bang",35.4

"first off, i want to say that i was in two minds about getting this game. reviews from the fans didnt seem very positive and as this game has a great community and fan following i was quite shocked. the main criticism has been the frequency of injuries. from what i have seen this is not even true! if anything ive seen fewer injuries than in previous versions. i have been looking closely to see this so called injury problem yet ive never seen more than two key players being injuried at one time and not even for very long! its overall a great and addicting game and my favourite yet if im honest. however, the match engine, although improved, is quite poor and freak goalkeeper mistakes dont seem all that freak anymore as they occur quite a few times each season. however im pretty sure the match engine isnt much to go by (the commentary sometimes says completely different things to what the match engine shows - e.g player shoots really wide but the commenary claims it was almost in) this isnt much of a problem in all honesty and if you had commentary on only you wouldnt ever notice. the new menu layout is really good in my opinion and finding what i want to do is now much easier and quicker making me actually pay more attention to tactics, training and scouting (which i have often ignored to a large extent in previous games) overall id say this game is great and the series is still going strong. so glad i got this game, i would advise you buy it too!",38.6

"bought the game today because there was supposed to be a patch to fix the terrible defence and injury problems. i just started my first ever save and i already have 16 players injured. every time i hit continue i was just waiting to see how long the next injury would be. also, if you thought this game had any semblance of defensive players actually doing anything other than scoring own goals or watching players walk right passed them you are in the wrong place. i realize this is the beta but the release is in 4 days and i dont see them fixing that many problems with a comlpetely broken game. ill play it again on release and the next patch but im back to fm 2014 (not much better) until then. will update review upon full release and/or next patch. edit: next game after writing this review i had 3 players injured during the game. this takes my total to 19 injuries before the season even begins. my reserve squad is nothing but loans and more injured players as well. maybe thats just bad luck but seriously how can this many people be injured long term all at once?!? update: upon playing the full release i can officialy say that the defense is still terrible and starting a new save fresh for the release has resulted in 9 injuries before the end of the preseason with crewe alexandre. so i am no longer playing the beta and as i guessed the problems have still not been sorted out. guess ill just be waiting until they patch more to start again. if im going to lose my life to my football manager addiction it wont be to a severely bugged match engine.",112.4

"playing fm since 2000/2001. the series is my favourite of all time across all genres. the last 3 years however the game has been getting gradually more of an exercise in ambigious tedium than the magical gaming experience it used to be. i appreciate the people at si need to change the game to justify the price tag, i just dont know why they insist on breaking the game to do so. i can only hope the truly awful new features (im looking at you tactics screen) will be patched. they wont though, way too much pride. god what ive give for the return of slide bars. id also love some explanation, no matter how vague, for how the 10 million different variables that can affect the outcome of a match actually work. im certain si changed the way things like tempo work in game for different tactics without mentioning it or eve updating the tips bar. poor form. moreover, having touchline shouts, pressers, player interaction, 3 teamtalks its too much, and its for the most part very very boring. as for the me just like with fm14 and 13 at release, its broken. you would think after 2 poor mes at release si would have the integrity and self respect to deliver this year... i remember when si used to release games that didnt need a single patch. i think the monopoly si have over the genre has made them complacent, its only natural i suppose. do not purchase until they have fixed the game. maybe in mid march 2 months before the season ends :d",299.5
"do not buy this game!! check my games list, you will see that i once loved fm games, not anymore and never again will i buy one. this is the type of unfinished game that steam need to ban from being sold. certain key components dont even work at all, a small example is that there are no penalties from handballs right now. the game fails in every way it could, the me is a poor imitation of a crossing and set pieces simulator not a football simulator. it is worse than the last three years versions upon release and i can assure you that they all had bugs and issues, not this many or this bad. if you really need more just go to the forums and read, not many that will claim this game is anywhere near in a playable state, maybe in 7-8 months from the time i write this si will have released a patch that makes it something like a game. oh if that wasnt enough beware, si and sega are not co-operating and are in fact sending customers with issues back and forth between them. (not me, but check forum if you care) also be aware that si are deleting the vast majority of negative posts, claiming it will affect the way our customers play the game. which is of course true, they wouldnt play it because they would know whats wrong with it.",36.5
"this game has its ups and downs, leading me to an inconclusive decision whether it is the best yet. to me, the match engine is unrealistic, the goalkeepers (dont get me started on the gks) seem to save the first and then be nowhere for the rebound. ive resorted to the classic 2d match engine so i dont have to painfully see these mistakes being made. if you want a prospect youre going to need the capital, as many enquiries i get come back with 57m which no one is going to pay for a 16 year old. although this being said it does make it more realistic in that aspect. overall its an improvement, and linked together with the steam workshop it gives players a chance to post their tactic of dominance in which other players can then implement into their game. all the issues ive stated can be patched up.",335.9

"thank god i only paid 5 for this, prasie the lord for gifts cards!! when playing fm13, i thought that these games were head and shoulders above any other football game in terms of the imersiveness and the elevel of realism. but the last two games since then have been truly discusting. i dont care about the graphics, thats not what the game is about, but the actual realism of the match engine is poor. what is going on with the goalkeepers this year?? about 10-15 of my conceded goals have come directly from rebounds from frankly rediculous saves from the keep, he will just parry the ball away from the most tame shot imaginable and stand there for about a year until the follow up from the opposition striker rolls it in. then he dives. injuries are something which many people are complaining about. i dont feel like my tactical changes have any efect on the game. match stats mean nothing. this is a real shame because i have a lot of time for si but im losing faith by the day. i feel like some things happen on the game just to make you more addicted, becasue lets be honest, its more addictive when your not winnimg, because you cant put the game down until you have sorted it. and why do you have a sudden drop in form ever jan or feb. every team has a bad patch, but i, aloong with many other players have unexplained drops in form where nothing you do can halt the slide. i could go on for hours but i cant be bothered to give anymore feed back because i dont think it makes any differenc so if this review does nothing more than let me take my anger out on it, then so be it",79.0
"ive bought this game for many years and think this might be my last. firstly im not keen on spending 30 a year on something that could be released as an update. the lack of competition in the manager genre has made si very lazy, to the point where they make one or two small changes and market it as a new game. here are some of the points where my problems lie -ridiculous injurys, in my first season there was not one point where i didnt have at least six players injured -how many times in real football does a team make all its subs then a player gets injured and they finish the game with 10 men? well in fm about one in three games but amazingly never to the computer opponent -its almost impossible to generate any momentum anymore in fm, you will be playing well then suddenly lose for no reason -football has always been in the headlines for footballers astronomical wages, thank god its not like fm, youth players who have never made a first team appearance asking for 40k! agents of average players asking for 5mill in fees! -instead of improving things like the ability to see how your players have performed in training during the week to help your decisions on who to play si add tunnel interviews?!? i can imagine the meeting at si so what have the fans on the forums been asking for well their all desperate for more press interviews in the game, they just dont feel theres enough as fans of the series we should treat si like an alchoholic relative and not hand over money to them to continue their bad habits, in this case their bad habits being treating fans like cash-cows that they can just make sub-standard games for and rely on fan loyalty",237.9
