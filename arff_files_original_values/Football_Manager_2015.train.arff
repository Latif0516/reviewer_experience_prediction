"i only recently got this as a prerelease before it comes out on november 7th. i never played any previous fms and this is certainly very addictive. if you like football you will love this game. i didnt even go with a top dollar team :o",33.9
"watching the matches definately ranks up there in some of the most frustrating things youve ever seen. and the defensive tactics are seriously flawed, was 8th in the prem with newcastle and needed some points on the board. so after going 3-0 to west ham(16th) up i hit up my 4-1-4-1 contain tactic, just to not conceed and see the game out with 3 points(35mins remaining), not in football manager 2015, after making my last 2 subs to suit the new formation i pick up 2 injuries and down to effectivley 9men, then draw 3-3. and that is barely the tip of the iceburg.",128.7
"tip: if you are unable to win what seems like a winnable game, vacation for one day.",214.8
"lots of injuries its true (one each game is almost assured), but i managed to stay alive (at least for now, march of my 1st season) cause they were all small injuries save for a couple of players out for months players dont really follow your instructions (short passes and pass to cb for the keeper, and he still always goes with the long ball). youll also concede thousands of goals from corner kicks: usually its corner kick- goal or corner kick-corner kick again-goal or even 3 times in a row and then you concede, and im having this crap more than once every 2 games. the scouting system is the thing that improved the most, and reports are now really useful (even if the final judgement sometimes contradicts the report itself). hope they will fix something in the next patch, but i cant reccomend it as it is now. (player of fm since 2005)",196.9
"only negative i can say is in my 3rd season with man utd i hit some sort of glitch that meant i couldnt win away from home! seriously, my home record was; played 19 won 18 drew 1... away record; played 19, won 3, drew, 6, lost 10. i had scores like loosing 2-1 to brentford (whom had been promoted) leading arsenal 4-1 with 10 mins to go, to drawing 4-4. beat city at old trafford 5-0 and lost at the etihad 5-3. the scores throughout that season just seemed very random, no matter what i did. other than that its very much same old fm (which there is nothing wrong with) already played 71 hours. trying to catch up on the 600+ hours i played of the last edition haha",194.1
"good game , its real i playing using manchester united team and half team is injury .................. thanks for the update , now this game so perfect.......... 10/10",163.5
"been playing fm now for nearly 20 years (way back when it was cm), but this is by far the worsrt version ive evef played( even worse than the version a few years back when everyone got injured) , the ai is terrible, nobody buys your players, you get quoted 25 mil for a player who is then sold for 5 mil to a rival!! match itself has taken a step backwards, players running over the ball in your own box, or gk passing straight to a striker or how about players who simply can not score!!!! worst of all ive give up 2 5-0 half time leads over team talks!! wont be buying fm2016.",362.6
"a must for true football passionees ( passionate people )",246.3
"i cant recommend this game despite it improving in many ways from previous versions. the reason for this is the focus on player interaction this year. players have always got unhappy for not getting enough game time, too much competition etc. this year not only does this happen more frequently but often without any justification. you then get to try to talk them round which almost always ends in half the squad becoming unhappy. at this point team morale is very low (meaning you lose a lot) and the only way to turn this around is to try and sell most of the team before you get sacked. hopefully si will fix this in the next patch.",647.6
"not the best version of this game, but still as adictive as it always has been. the main issue is the amount of injuries players get, even for the slightest of knocks theyre out for months. apart from that, the rest of the game is fine.",117.9
"they built a new engine for the matches: graphics are worse, behaviours are worse and physics is ridiculous. why didnt you keep the old one? id better update the database on fm 2012 and be happy. this game isnt terrible, but its a big downgrade to previous versions.",44.2
"would defonately recommend to the fellow football fan.",592.5
"excellent game if you like football. easy to get into... very difficult to master. be warned..... free time is now a thing of the past and days playing this game will roll over into each other and before you know it, the next one is out!",128.8
"the game is just awesome! really good job from sport interactive! i suggest it 100% careful with crash! i had crash but sega helped me ;) buy this  <3",109.9
"fantastic game. i have never been great at football manager since 2010 but i have had a brilliant season 1, which i will now play plenty more.",125.5
"this game has its ups and downs, leading me to an inconclusive decision whether it is the best yet. to me, the match engine is unrealistic, the goalkeepers (dont get me started on the gks) seem to save the first and then be nowhere for the rebound. ive resorted to the classic 2d match engine so i dont have to painfully see these mistakes being made. if you want a prospect youre going to need the capital, as many enquiries i get come back with 57m which no one is going to pay for a 16 year old. although this being said it does make it more realistic in that aspect. overall its an improvement, and linked together with the steam workshop it gives players a chance to post their tactic of dominance in which other players can then implement into their game. all the issues ive stated can be patched up.",335.9
"ui is damn bad tactics is damn bad bad goal everywhere is damn bad injuries every game is damn bad im feeling bad spent money on this bad game is damn bad my feeling now is damn bad",281.2
"having played twenty-something hours im giving up on this and going back to fm2013. no more horrible interface, with ugly blocky colours, overuse of logos, and player faces that cannot be turned off. no more players sulking for no reason. no more rugby score games. no more daft injuries.",24.1
"i wouldnt recommend buying this game until a few patches are released. the release version is full of bugs, especially the match engine, that makes it almost unplayable. i mean, sure, you can play it, but you just have to cringe at all the goals scored from obvious match engine bugs. at this point, 50% of goals are scored from crosses on the wing that your defenders just dont contest, 30% scored from set pieces, 10% scored on missplaced backpasses to the keeper and 10% for the rest. the defense and goalie are so terrible most matches end with 4+ goals scored. if you want to win, just make sure you have wingers who like to hug the touchline and cross the ball instead of cutting inside should have expected it really, it is the first time i buy fm right on the release date.",251.6
"was finally due to the sale price enticed to buy the game. got pretty excited. i found the new layout to be quite nifty. interactions were nifty. and then it got to the point where i was taking a closer look at my favorite club (which is at point of writing at least still in the top 50 of biggest european clubs . the budget was all wrong, some player names were horribly botched, positions were botched, potential for the academy players and status in the club was just awfully put together. transfervalues were completely messed up (the man whos supposedly the player with the highest value in the squad is actually in real life the most shunned and loathed player who the fans hope the club gets rid of as soon as they can and a substitute at most). the list goes on and on and on. cant recommend something that made me so upset right off the bat.",18.0
"i buy fm every other year, so can only comapre it to 2013. i think the layout of menus has improved (although it takes a little while to get used to). interactions with players, staff and media is a lot better. i wouldnt say that the match engine is vastly inferior to 2013. i recommend this",176.0
"it is a new game, with a new and very easy to use interface imo, together with the gameplay fm15 looks amazing on the outside. i know this is just a beta and i have only played a few hours on this game, i have encountered problems which i dont know whether i am terrible at managing arsenal or that the bugs are really messing me up. 1. lots and lots of own goals, it happened that calum chambers scored a hatrick of own goals against qpr which ultimately lost me the game. 2. injuries, injuries everywhere. at least all my players have been injured once since i have been in charge (4months) and it is getting ridiculous. debuchy was injured for 3 months then i played him once he got fit and got injured again for another 2. it is getting out of hand. 3. goalkeepers. where do i begin? goalkeepers do the craziest  in the entire world, sometimes it can be funny and other times its frustrating as fwuak. it is also not my own gk aswell when i check other games replay, the goalies can be proper (sorry). other than those issues this game has been great for me. i absolutely love the tactics menu, the new scouting system and more player interaction. even though this game does have its issues, it should not be discouraged to play it. i am sure these issues are being brought up by si and they are trying to fix it. personally even with its bugs, it is a better and more challenging game than fm14 7/10 peace <3 edit: si officialy released a patch fixing issues with the goalkeepers and the own goals <3 si",424.9
"arsenal won the league and liverpool won the champions in the same year. 10/10 for realism",150.1
"quite a few glitches but thats because im playing the alpha version. looks like its going to be another succesful instalment to the series!",380.0
"i choose to play man utd. so far all match are good and challenging. just won against arsenal and everton. not much injury so far.",145.0
"ive played most the football managers over the years and to be fair, this is a big step up from fm14 which was awful, i have actually got into this fm and enjoyed every minute of it. i like the new press and scouting features and can see a difference with the game engine, even if its small. for everybody saying its awful, just remeber its still a new release, and comparing with last year its pretty descent. i havent had the trouble of to many goals from crosses. to me, this game is enjoyable and fun.",140.1
"i play fm since the 2008 version, and this version has serious problems in relation to reality of the game. matches with a lot of goals and many players injuring easy make this version the worst view of the fm series. among the positive points, unfortunately, can only say an improvement in direct negotiations between players and clubs.",615.3
"barely playable. its been said 100 times but defending is non existent.",594.9
"there obviously are many problems with the game (too many injuries, last minute aids, freezing, players unhappy when you praise them, etc), but i still enjoy the game. i didnt enjoy fm14 but i think this one is much better, the layout is much better and even though there are lots of bad reviews and problems with the game i still recommend it to people who enjoy football and want to be serious about management.",215.1
"sensationally good game, following in the footsteps of its predecessors. the genius of its improvements are in the constant simplification of its features which makes it equally accessible to either hardcore football fans, casual gamers or indeed both.",247.7
"bought this game after the december update and regarding the problems many other customers have complained about below i have to say after four full months of the first season i havnt had any problems with crazy amounts of injuries and the match engine is not producing crazy results. its not a perfect game, i think if the developers spent more time and effort on it then the game could be what it should be in the year 2015 after the 23 years of product development time theyve had since i first played cm on my amiga 500 back in the day, not to get to long winded - in my opinion its the best version ive played yet but it should have been this good in 2001. pros - steam workshop, fast gaming experience relative to previous versions, lots of options, not neccessarily overly complicated, match engine is capable of the beautiful game at times and does manage to elicit strong emotions in me, did i mention steam workshop? cons - gks sometimes go mindless for a few seconds in match engine leading to fantasy breaking silly goals this happens maybe once every three games, -having to always watch the kick offs and final whistle highlights in match engine even if nothing interesting happens, -about once a game in the match engine a pointless highlight will show and last too long even though nothing interesting is happening.",41.5
"this game will be unplayable: injured player every matches, players unhappy if they dont playing during two weeks. im sad but its the last time i buy this game. the last good version is fm13. fm14 and fm15 are not realists, they are unplayable.",61.6
"just one more match... just... one... more... match... *after match* oh so i got a match versus chelsea? lets play that one just before i go to bed! *after 8 hours* oh right, its time to go to school again *falls asleep*",10.5
"dont buy it, stupid engine, stupid interface. worst fm ever.",350.8
"excellent as per, there are small bugs to fix and changes to be made but there always are at this stage of release. i always find the finished article is when they release the large update after the january transfer window. regardless, definitely worth a purchase.",787.5
"the worst and most bugged release ever. dont buy it until feb. needless to say, my problems are the same of other people: tennis score, conceding a lot from corners etc. this release is a fraud.",111.8
"excellent game i have far too much time playing this it is just that addicting",167.2
"i am a long time player of fm and with so many negative reviews i had some hesitations with this title. bought it though on the recent 33% discount offer. so far, i find it better than fm2014. i guess it has been patched because i didnt encounter any of the problems other players are complaining about (useless goal-keepers, lags and craches, lots and lots of injuries, crazy score lines etc). visually speaking, the 3d simulation of the game is in my opinion the best so far for this game, but you should keep in mind this is not fifa. keep in mind though that im not able of saying if the simulation reflects or not the tactical orders given to the players. what i dislike most is the lack of team logos. when you are asking 50 euros for each new installement at least you could get the proper rights to use the real logos.",196.5
"its quite easy creating a tactic that creates a lot of chances, millions of clearcuts... but, you see, when a clear cut chance is created, the game rolls two dice, and if they aint both a six you do not score. this is a game of chance, and i have had more fun playing heads/tails.",375.2
"miasanmia, lads! good game overall, its better than 2014 imo.",383.9
"if people are terrible at this game they shouldnt be allowed to write reviews for it, which is what 90% of the negative reviews seem to be. great game, so immersive, and a real challenge when starting at the lower leagues. 10/10",156.7
"multiplayer works flawlessly in my experience playing with 3 friends. everything outside of the match engine is significantly improved over last year. the match engine is worse than ever with odd goalkeepers, lots of injuries and extremely glitchy gameplay. when playing online its really funny to see how awful the stadiums, celebrations and general gameplay is and its still a great rpg. in single player its considerably more frustrating but it makes for some funny stories and there isnt a better alternative. if you want a realistic football/soccer simulation, this isnt it; its not even close. however, you really arent going to do any better and you will still get over 500 hours out of it, if its your kind of thing.",203.4
"if you are a fan of football, youll need to play this!",20.3
"very buggy. even simple things like modifying views dont work. the interface is very badly constructed and confusing. overall this is a giant step back from previous versions. it doesnt add anything to the game except bugs. no real inovation over years past. save a little money and get a better version. fm 2013 is pretty good. 2013 is basically identical to 2015, except with fewer bugs, and more cool community mods.",87.4
"microtransactions.... need i say more! will never buy another footy manager, theyve completely lost the plot with this one.",175.4
"as much as i love the franchise and the previous releases, this one just doesnt do it for me. its a horrible game atm.. realism; non existing. its basically fm14 with a sidebar, more time wasted on annoying interviews and an, if you can belive it, even worse match engine (the worst one so far in any fm game imo). it has the potential to become a great game, but it needs so, so, so much work that i dont think si will be able to pull it off before the release of fm16. im not going to recommend this game right now, but if there is a god then it might be worth it to check back in 2 or 3 months to see if anything has improved. cheers..",141.2
"i am playing this game till 98. i am a big fan. till now. 2015 is totally hearhbreaker. i did not like it at all. it supposed to be more realistic then last year but its not. main skin is so bad and also we dont have any other skin in it. last year it was very hard to move bigger clubs. i started my carrier with fenerbahe (former turkish champion) at 2015. first year i won league and turkish cup. next year i won league and i qualifed champions league group. on second round bara came to me. i eleminate 5-4 aggregiate. it was nice. then i received many contract offer from many clubs. sevilla, bilbao and then juventus. i accepted offer from juve. juve had bad year they were 3 and many unhappy players in it. within 2 weeks i received another offer which is not normal. real madrid came to me after 2 weeks at juventus. i did not win anything. i just eleminate psv 8-0 aggragate.. thats it? is this enough for real madrid? 2 league champions turkey, 1 turkish cup, 1 champions league group qualify. man, you need to fix this game as soon as possible.",253.5
"some improvements here and there, but generally a step backwards. in game engine sucks, players get hurt constantly and even the in-game editor i paid 5 bucks for isnt working at the moment. a buggy mess and i hope to get some value out of the purchase after they finally fix their issues.",126.4
"rubbish cant even upload the game and get started!!!",0.3
"have to rage quit almost every time i play because people get injured or big mamdou sakho gets sent off for no reason. also daniel sturridge has 19 finishing but cant score a one on one for . what is the point in stats if they do  all?",27.5
"as always, my next year gonna be wasted on this game.",358.9
"this game is probably the worst ever made.. the skin is confusing, they havent added any new useful options in the game, but worst of all, the game engine..!!! i have never ever, ever!! experienced such a completely useless game engine.. during a match it doesnt matter who you play or whether you play defensive or offensive, the result will always be that the will score at least 2 against you and sometimes you score a lot of goals and sometimes you only score once.. futhermore your players will be injured half of the time.. even when youre on a roll and havent lost 5 games in a row, your team will loose to a team in the bottom..! so much wrong with this game that they really have to make a lot of updates.. and quickly.. even if youre a fan of the series this game is a total catastrophy.. play fm 14, 13 or 12 instead..!",74.7
"overall, fm15 is a good game. different from fm14, providing different tactics and new ways of training. there are also some improvements regarding press conferences, they are shorter compared to fm14 and the question variety is greater. touchline team talks was also a good addition and the overall general layout is technically easier than fm14. saying that though, if you are an experienced fm player be prepared to take a while to get used some minor details, such as making a player avaliable to the under 21 squad is under the development tab instead of a squad tab. the 3d match engine is slightly better, however sometimes the goalkeepers do not behave like real goalkeepers in the 3d match engine. not diving, sometimes the keeper slides across on his two feet to save a shot instead of diving, other than that it is an improvement. however, the game by default does not have badges or logos or many player faces, you have to download that yourself. the tactics are technically more straight foward, if your new to fm you may find them easier compare to previous fms. however, if you are experienced it will take a while getting used to the changes. to conclude, i would reccomend the game, however it is not a big improvement to 14 and it may perhaps be better to wait for 16 or wait for more updates, however if you do decide to buy it, it is still worth it.",181.5
"agree with others here, very inbalanced, no matter what i do i leak in goals like my goal is ten time sbigger than the opponents, just no fun in this game at all, score lines are out of control, just horrid on so many levels, i really do hope they fix this quick, and yes you could have a player with a 18 pace and see someone with pace of 9 catch them with no effort at all.",721.3
"very good game, best of the fm games. shame about the premier league not having the licensed badges, but this can be added using steam workshop.game is more fun when playing online together rather than single player (my opinion) would definitely recommend",103.4
"at the moment, its not enjoyable and borderline unplayable heavily down to the awful match engine. might come back when they decide to publish a finished game, until then ill stick to fm 2010, much better game!",53.6
"i like the new skin, generally a small step forward",135.1
"honestly, ive been purchasing this game for 9 years now and honestly i dont understand why players are never fit. several of my players even the non-injury prone players seem to repeatedly die on the pitch. united seem to be able to be in the relegation and still win champions league i mean honestly utter crap too many offside goals and star ratings arent realistic",671.9
"just up-graded from 2013 (i only do it every 2 years to avoid disapointment lol) and this is the buggiest version to date graphics glitches left, right and centre and very few new exiting features, plust the engine needs sorting out its even worse than the original unpatched version of 2013 and that was poor enough with at least 1 owngoal a match. as it stands with out some heavy patching from si this game is almost unplayable! as for a recommendation all i have to say is dont buy this game yet, wait for some updates to be released.",131.6
"there is certainly a lot more going on in this years iteration of fm - certain elements have been changed massively from the fm14 look, whilst some have received only a mild tweaking. this tends to be the case nearly every year and dont always result in an improved product the changes made this year have largely been pleasing, although in particular i am not a fan of the new tactics board. it seems like the information i need is still there but it is hidden behind extra menus and mouse clicks, generally creating what feels to me like an inefficient system when compared to fm14. the gameplay has remained largely the same and is familiar to anyone who has spent time with the series. the engine seems to have been improved in some areas and regressed in others, again mirroring previous versions of the game. there seem to be more goals going in, more goals from crosses and set pieces, and more defensive errors. the game also seems harder and learns an inflexible managers tactics rather quickly. i only use the 2d classic view so cant comment on the 3d match engine, i have never used it or had any interest in it. fundamentally, its still great fun to build and develop a team, to argue with other managers and to lead your club to glory or glourious defeat. i would definitely recommend this to anyone with more than a passing interest in the franchise and it represents a solid return on investment in terms of new features and gameplay hours.",253.5
"calling football manager the best management sim out there is always a redundant statement. true as it is, its peerless excellence has chased any significant rivals away. but the biggest task is tempting players away from their carefully built career in the previous game. sports interactive know that its games biggest competition remains itself and, as you may tell your team at halftime, they must guard against complacency. fm15s changes tend to contribute to gentle improvement rather than startling disruption, but should do enough to tempt you into starting that managerial journey all over again.",56.6
"there just werent enough changes for me. one thing i wouldve liked to have seen is the ability to practise set pieces. on the last fm i used to concede from corners a lot. i wouldve liked the opportunity to set up a defence vs attack scenario and seen how it played out and then tweaked my instructions based on that. apart from the skin and the tracksuit manager element from what i can see from the beta is that nothing much has changed. i appreciate that you dont want to mess with the format too much but there is scant reason to get excited about this update.",225.4
"when games start asking for more money, than the price paid for the game, then we have a problem. i am not saying you have to spend more money.. but for the option to be there.. well its not needed. its put there for the dummies who are willing to spend in-game money.",235.1
"terrible, just keeps checking and scanning for updates when i try and click play game then i end up back on this page! tried to uninstall steam and install the game by itself but cannot do this any more. when i could actually play the game i consistently had 5/6 players injured. tried to do too much and ruined the game, needs some patches big toime!",50.3
"it is a great game to play and the menus look better it is worth the money",19.3
"massive fm fan and this game will be another great one in the list! however, if you enjoyed fm14 you will be dissapionted! big changes that will take time to adapt to. however i shall put my trust in miles and co.",228.5
"great game. to all you complaining about it, you just need to perfect your tactics instead of expecting to win every single game from the word go. loving everything about it!",359.7
"arsenal finished 4th in the league. i can confirm this is the most realistic football game you can find on this planet.",10.8
"i have been reading through the reviews for this game, yet i cant understand how people have said how rubbish they thing this new release is? of course its going to have some bugs/faults/issues with the game as soon as it comes out, just like any other pc game you buy, none are perfect as soon as theyre released due to companies being pushed to release their games quicker so that they ensure they make a fast profit. you just need to be patient, like i was. once the bugs were fixed and it was all how it was supposed to be, this is a really good game. probably the best one out of the fm series yet, due to you have to actually scout and search for certain player that you want/need. instead of their being a huge list of transfer listed players available, so its hit and miss on whether you get bargains or you end paying the full price. which is extrememly realistic. the 3d graphics have been improved making it more realistic on the pitch especially with the new team talk feature allowing you to shour specific instructions to your team. the only downside is that sega have yet again tried and failed with the media, i started of as a conference north team (chorley fc) yet i have press conferences before and after every game. surely a team that has only just made it to the conference north, shouldnt be having this many press conferences/tunnel interviews if they havent even been fully estabilished by anyone hardly? it just makes it seem like they havent put much thought into the media. overall i am pretty much on this game all the time now, its extrememly addicting, i would advice anyone to purchase this. plus 30 for a pc game is nothing these days? bargain.",98.3
"awful game,full of match engine problems as well as thousand of in game difficulties!!!not recommended,not going to take it anymore!!",150.0
"most realistic football game ever and you get to think like a manager like in the real world of football",207.0
"bought this game at christmas. i bought the download version. when i play a match, there is no sound. sometimes when i validate the game cache, sound does play in match. having to verify my cache everytime i want to play a game is not good, due to the fact that it rartely works, and takes a while. i went into game, the guy tried to send me packing, telling me the usual nonsense that it wasnt bought there etc. anyway, to cut a long story short, the guy phoned up someone (steam maybe) and i was told to contact them with my order number/date etc. its now been 6 days, and i still have had no reply. this is shocking. the game was purchased on the 25/12/14. it is now 14/01/15 and my game is still not even being looked into. also, i have read a lot of bad reveiws/bugs upon researching ways to fix the sound. if you want to be treated like this, then this game is for you.",241.4
"i didnt like the game at all i cant even play it the colors of the background really hurt my eyes i cant look more than 10 mins. i played football manager 13 before and that was much better than this. background is fully black and all the other lively colors make it hard to read. and you cant personalize this. you cant see the additional packs bought in the game. i am really frustrated. i cant see the full pitch while playing in 2d mode. i can not search for players after 2 transfers. what is wrong this year?",154.4
"i think this game is the best fm in years. but its not fun before u learn it properly!",11.5
"short and sweet, you will concede 98% of your goals through the crossing/corner/free kick fault. no matter how many you score you can guarentee the other team, no matter their stature can and probably will pull it back to win by 2 or 3.",93.9
"keepers seem to be really slow at reacting and bad back passes are a reoccurring theme! but overall a solid game.",64.1
"steam workshop is rubbish. sub to a mod and it doesnt even show up in my downloads",8.8
"enjoy it a lot. much better than fm 14. all problem has been fixed.",177.8
"i can not believe i paid $33 for this crap. 2015 game with such graphics? it is just a game for those who do not want to sit infront of the screen, do some adjustments and click on play, go back to your daily works and chech once in a while. other than that not worth a penny.",484.6
"if youre into this football then this is the game for you but look for it at a discount as its quite pricey otherwise one of the best games ive played in a while",291.4
"i think it is time someone creates a new football managment game to give si some competition. this is pretty much the same game weve played for years. a good one i must admit but it feels old and isnt all that existing.",30.7
"time for yet another fm, and instead of the usual praise to the sky; i find myself struggling for words. i played as fc copenhagen, within a month i had 8(!) first/key team members out with injuries - and not just the common cold, mind you - no, oh no. one with a broken ankel, two with damaged tendrons, a broken foot etc. the shortest injury was 3(!!!!) months - i feel like im running a community hospital rather than a football club. anyways, we recover and start winning some matches - except... we dont. for some odd reason it seems like you can dominate a match, to the point where even the opponents fans are rooting for you, and yet they still pull a comeback at the end. draws galore. 1 shot, 1 kill, so to speak. but heck, lets review some of the positives as well... great, realistic scouting system. good layout. aaaaand. yup. id recommend you wait purchasing this game until another update has come out. do it for you own sake, and for ours - the unfortunate souls that purchased this game in good faith that it would be the high standard the game usually is. let them feel the heat, so they can fix this asap.",513.0

"while no significant changes since fm2014, its a worthy improvement, especially with the new ui. some of the earlier issues have been addressed by the latest updates but still the defensive / crossing aspect of the game engine seems rather flawed. also the motivational man management of the squad can be rather annoying to deal with, its just a matter of learning the best responses to the relevant question. scouting has been much improved (in terms of realism) over recent incarnations of the franchise. worth buying but not an essential purchase 7/10.",257.5

"i have to disagree with the majority of reviews. i have played the franchise for years also and i am loving this edition. may be it is because i have just brought it and it has been updated but everything including the match engine have been drastically improved. the injurys are nothing out of the ordanary and i am playing with arsenal. goals per game are very realistic, and i have had only 2 big wins out of 10 games yet i have lost only 1 friendly and the charity sheild against city which ended 2-0. what ever the other reviews said negitivly about this game i have seen none of so far, and to think i almost took note of what people where saying and almost never brought it and i am so glad i did. cdkeys sold it for 20.91 and it was well worth it already. didnt think i liked the dark skin and i was disappointed that it was the only one but after trying a few of the custom light skins i soon went back and love the original dark skin now. my one critic so far is the pitchs look slighly blocky and not smooth enough.",394.6
"this franchise had been in decline for a few years now. fm14 had absolutely terrible defending, and the problem still isnt gone. this is especially clear in lower leagues, where its rare to have a game without at least 4 goals. the match engine does look and work better, in most aspects, than last year, but at the end of the day, the scorelines are still ridiculously unrealistic. the 3d engine is still extremely bad graphically, but whatever, 2d classic is the way to go, i mean it would be, if not for the unrealistic results. i havent played a really good fm in years, and this is not one either.",114.4

"having put in 1000 or so hours into the 2011, 2012, and 2013 versions altogether, i can safely say that football manager 2015 is the worst ive played so far. and not worst as in its still enjoyable, worst as in its just not a good or fun game anymore. something has been changed since those games that i cant explain. sides with the best defence in the leage concede 4 in the first 10 minutes of the game; the top 4 teams in real life lounge around in lower mid table positions; youth players ask for wages of a consistent first team player. and the match engine, dear god the match engine. players are clearly fouled but the referees do nothing. players simply stand and watch as others walk past them. tackles are so few and far between that im not sure playing defenders is worth it. and scores with 8 goals or more are not nearly as rare as they should be. if you want to play football manager, get 2012 or 2013. because this one sucks.",69.0

"at first i thought this game was a massive step up on fm 14 but after playing for only a few hours i have realised what a massive dissapointment this game really is, i knoiw itss only beta but so many things need changing that i cant see the end products as being that good. first of all injuries are outragious, you are guaranteed to get an injury a game and can find yourself without you key players only 4 games in to the season. second problem is the new match engine the amount of times my players have just stood there and watched charlie adams ping a 50 yard screamer in whilst my keeper does nothing is ridiculos, seriously though the ai rarely do anyting. the transfers are so unrealistic, the value of a player might be 10 million but you will end up having to pay 40 million for a decent player. finally the worst part is the inconsistency of the matches, you can go and play manchester city away and thrash the 6-0 and then lose at home to west brom 4-0 this was a problem in early fm 14 and that got soon fixed, im not saying you should win every game but the game feels too inconsistant, there isnt enough realism in matches. i have been looking forward to fm 15 for a while now and am quite dissapointed so far:( at this stage tbh i wouldt recommend fm 15 untill things have been changed, people are rating this game because i told my player i was gonnna sell him and he got upset that has been in fm for an age and isnt a real addition, there are positives of this game but not enough.",169.5

"why is every single injury in this game for me a sports hernia (out for 4-5 weeks). i am 4 seasons in on a save and in the bpl and i have had no injurys that lasted for more than 3 months but at any given time my goalkeeper and at least 2 of my first team players are out with a sports hernia. other than that good game.",174.5

"the graphics is great, it more realistic than fm 2014, the engine is great, a lot of cool stuff and great look. but it still like older fm and not quite change a lot. there are still bugs, the most thing that make me hated is the shots. in a match my team scored 18 but 9 on target and 3 goals when they shot 10, 6 on target and 5 goal. and the second thing is injury why is injury happened a lot and crazy like 6-7 months, 3-5 months, 6-7 weeks. but this game is still cool, i really like this game. if you like football and like manage football club, i recommend you to play this!!! for me this game is 7.5/10",45.3

"--- below is my original review, but i have changed it from recommended to not recommended, because even after patching, the game and match-engine is unrealistic; how could the programmers not realise this? i regret buying it and have gone back to fm14.--- this game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, though it does have its problems. id definitely recommend this to fans of the series. lets go through the pros and cons: pros: - i like the new ui, i think its improved on previous titles, with things like scouting/transfers in more logical places - it runs smoother: you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match; instead it takes less than 2 seconds. this means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time. - i havent seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries; its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me. -player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved cons: - weirdly takes longer to save than fm14. over a minute and a half for me. - the games are too high scoring, and this needs to be patched for realism purposes. i just had 5 games that were 6-3, 6-3, 5-3, 0-0 (lol) and 6-3 again... a bit silly... - goalkeepers are pretty bad, hence the high scores. - it feels like its harder to play a possession game, but that might be just because im leicester. its a fun game; im definitely glad i bought it. good for fans of the series; if patched it could be brilliant. they say theyve solved the issue of too many fks going in, but they dont seem to have",88.9

"i see a lot of negative reviews here, some even from experienced fm players. to be honest, really experienced players dont (seriously) play fm until final patch - that one with winter transfer updates, which also (usually) fixes all unwanted stuff like injuries, corners, woodwork, one-on-ones and other weird things devs did to ruin gameplay (they do it every year btw, youll see the pattern if you continue to play fm  its almost a tradition). just remember that football manager until the final patch is a public beta and youll be ok. as for the game itself, i played one season so far and enjoyed it. there were too much injuries, but it can be considered as a challenge (also rotation and young players were extremelly happy to replace crippled first team members). there were too much woodwork (but several fms back it was much worse). there were some nice goals and dramatic matches. overall, it was typical football manager experience  not ideal, but quite enjoyable. match engine improved a lot  much less scripted goals, much more goal diversity (my player even won goal of the month award  thing i cant remember since introducing 3d match engine). still, we have a lot of morale goals during 46-48 min period, but i guess itll never change. anyway, you can have some fun with fm15 or die from a rage attack. your choice. tl;dr: try it, but starting long-term careers until patch 15.3 is out is unadvisable.",120.4

"issue for me these days with fm is the staleness of the whole experience. there are things wrong with the match engine as others have pointed out, but the whole series has emphasised width over depth since it moved from being cm to fm - ive been playing since domark versions on the amiga. i remember when we only had text based commentary and the tension was incredible, there was the feeling of just being given enough information and let your imagination fill in the gaps. fm2015 in particular gives you so many features it can initially feel overwhelming, until that is, you realise it doesnt really matter. keep your players happy, make sure your tactics are reasonably sane, gradually improve your squad, and well thats it... obviously, you can complicate that as much as you like if thats what you want, but the whole game experience is totally flat now. every iteration just adds a couple more features that arent really fleshed out much on top of a bunch of features from previous iterations that havent been developed further once they have been introduced. all we seem to really pay 40 (assuming you buy on release) for is a data update and a quick polish - it makes no difference if the dev team have put thousands of hours into each version if the end-users experience is so stale - its lost sight of the end-user experience, and thats what hurts so much. the adding of in-game purchases is also a massive turn-off for me (and others who have given up on fm sooner than i inevitably will); seriously, micro-payment to increase your clubs bank balance? buy editor access? purchase no transfer restrictions? whose idea was this? its awful.",209.8

"people often send me messages asking why i am playing this game. so i thought i would post a review to explain why. i will first point out that i have a strong interest in football. i wouldnt say i watch the matches, but i am always reading news stories online and am up to speed with the majority of world football headlines. i will also say i am not a massive fan of the fifa series of games produced by ea. they seem to have a very immature audience whenever i have tried to play them online and that is something which puts me of immediately. football manager (the series), puts you in the office of a football manager (shocker huh?), you take on all the jobs that a football manager does, from setting up tactics, to training sessions all the way to signing new players for your team. personally, i find myself getting very immersed in this game. there is something really special about taking a team from one of the lower leagues, all the way up to being the best team in the world. once you pass the first couple of seasons, the players which are around today all start to retire, move onto different teams etc, this is when the game really begins. the game will create computer generated random players, these are called regens. how good these regens are depends on a number of things, but mostly the training and youth facilities you have at your club. there is nothing more satisfying in the this game, than finding a young 17 year old unknown kid, and training and developing him into a world-class footballer. people may laugh or snarf at this game, but if you enjoy football, and want to find yourself a massive addictive time sync, then football manager is the game for you.",138.3

(not sure how that works.) 2) some errors made by defenders and keepers are simply unexplainable.(not sure if its a bug or not). sometimes the defenders just heads/pass the ball back towards the keeper and then the keeper just stands there making no attempt of clearing it whilst an opposition is running towards it. 3) when players dribble they run into teamates far too often. which is quite unrealistic as it hardly ever happens in real life. 4) this is a very irritating one. players misses 1v1s far too much, if they have 4-5 1v1 chances theyll manage to score one.... this is very unacceptable as in real life players in top leagues simply dont miss all those chances. you could say that they are having a bad game but its happening consistantly throughout the season. also the opposition always manage to score them when they have the chance. but our players just blast it strait at their keepers. 5) final one so far... players some how manages to score some incredible long shots but they simply just blast it over the goal when they are at the 6 yard box which is again unexplainable (sometimes it is harder to miss then to just get it on target). so far i havnt seen a single finesse shot by my players and only 1 from the opposition. please could you fix these issues. i would be forever greatful.",203.2

"i want to play this game. i like fantasy games. but everytime i start it up, i remember that half my team will be injured within the first 3 months. that no matter what i do consistency is not possible and my team will fail to perform and i will fail to have any real impact on that despite the rediculas sometimes over lapping micro-managing aspects that are both too specific and too general. example... exploit the flanks doesnt mean exploit the flanks more, it means only exploit the flanks unless you select other options. in which that ratio cant be controlled. example... you can have multiple coaches for multiple traits and skills but can only have one practice type per day. you can try to teach a player a new move or position; and its up to the player if hes compatable let alone compitent. you will train and trade and chances are players wont want to come to your club in which case the conversational options are minimal repetative and non-impactful. oh and did i mention that some of the user interface is completely bugged? and i mean completely! try organizing your custom view and watch as some of your options *do not appear*. you want to sort by position; sure, wait then why does it sort by ability when i click position? to suggest this game would be to encourage this type of lack luster game developing that is become the norm. im not saying you cant make money, but just publish a game every other year and charge us 100$ for something you can be proud of. instead of dusting off and polishing the same game with improved data.",135.3

"game keeps crashing and is unplayable despite trying all the recommended fixes. getting support for this game is also insanely difficult.",204.6
"i have always been a fan of fm since the days of cm therefore i may sound biased. good: its another new version of the fm series that have grown from strength to where they are right now. the fact is that championship manager and fifa manager are no more in the market shows how strong the monopoly fm has on football management games. bad: the crash dumps are very frequent. so i have to resort to saving the game before every game. (i hope that my save game never get corrupted.) overall, this is akin to an addiction to crack cocaine. you will just keep buying it every time it comes out. the painful part is that how do you start all over again if you are very deep in your game. (im looking at you fm 16.)",752.6
"i bought this yesterday and am in love with the amount of stuff you can do in this game, its crazy ! if you love football and love the idea of managing, then this is the best game for you !",5.3
"can anyone tell me how play on ipad? ive downloaded the game to pc but want it on ipad aswel/instead",226.3
"not sure what all the negative feedback is about, i think this is a good addition to an aready great series. the new player attribute style is alot better than the old everything greyed out of before, the ability to have your team captain help you with player morale issues etc. the match engine has been fine with me and ive logged 54 hours so far.",249.7
"warning: do not buy this game. ive been a loyal fan of fm for almost a decade now. this is by far the worst fm ever produced. loading the menu screen is slow, network games have become intollerable because of the lag, and the injuries have become so frequent that it borders on the absurd. they had one job to do all year since the last fm, which was to update the squads and update the scouting stats. now im angry at valve for having a no refund policy.",38.7
"graphics and interface are great, the challenges and the new features are nice too, but the match engine is still awful. please sports interactive fix that match engine with dumb and bizarre plays. i play fm since the first ones and the match engine and a.i. always sucked, it seems that the newer versions keep the same horrible match engine. anyway, i still recommend the game if you are a football addict.",99.5

"i am a long term fan of this game franchise since the good old champ man 2 days, however in recent years ive really struggled with releases - lots of broken features, and a general feeling of new releases being more of an update than a new version. i didnt have high hopes for this year... im happy to report that ive been proven wrong. the new ui is great, with the google style search bar, and easy to navigate to important information on the menu bar on the left. the whole tracksuit / tactical manager profile option is a great feature, and at lower league clubs, youre able to directly involve yourself in the development of players without needing to hire in un-obtainable coaches, but it doesnt feel like a cheat as you need to surround yourself with motivators, tacticians and probably a director of football. im not sure on some of the new staff role - not really sure what a head physio does over and above a normal physio, but the chief scout is great in removing the micro-management of setting scouting assignments, but it would be useful to be able to override his assignments if you need to. match engine looks good, but still seems to have some bugs - im sure my strikers arent offside half the time its called, and often find muyself screaming never or 1-0 to the referee at my screen, but thats no diferent from when im in the stands on a saturday :) overall, this is a good version of the game, and has re-invigorated my love following a couple of years in the wilderness.",315.2
"i really love this series of games and have played fm since the 2009 edition. this time they have gone a step down in my opinion. the new layout is okay. the interface bar on the left side instead of the top is a great new thing, but from there on its just worse to be honost. the tactic section is clumsy and very few things are better and alot of things are worse. besides from that it seems like the match engine is way worse too. normally there would be some sense of stability, but now i can play as man city and win 8-0 against sporting(por) and then lose againt some 3rd division team 3-6 in the next match. theres an unbelieveable amount of injuries which is so damn frustrating. the search engine has got a makeover that is for the better, although i seem to have a problem finding young players from outside europe without making the leagues playable. all in all a turn for the worse, but most of the problems could be solved with some updates and maybe a choice to chose the old tactics interface (please??). at this very moment i would not recommend it, but as mentioned it could be very recommendable if some fixes come soon. over and out. christian bang",35.4
"the best game out right now. whether it be conquering the ancient world, colonizing a map or planet, winning a world war, or dominating your fictional baseball league; this simulation/strategy for some reason has always been and continues to be more fun and better. if you arent a soccer fan yet, it is only because you havent played this.",87.9

"better than fm 2014 but still awful and unrealistic. terrible passing, countless corners, through balls are very rare, player attributes still has no effect ( mertesacker is faster than bale and ronaldo)",407.3
"the only game where over half of your players will get injured every ing time they play",267.6
"core experience remains the same but an upgraded match engine and a few new features make this a worthwhile addition. much like its predecessor, fm2015 is an evolution of the series rather than a revolution. this is both a bad and a good thing. the main differences between 2014 are mainly numerous small things that i will not mention here. i will mention the two things that stand out to me however. 1.) match engine: this has been in my opinion, greatly improved. matches seem to flow better, there are far more moves, goals scored seem mutch more varied and over all it makes it harder to predict the outcome of a move (something i found i could do with previous match engines due to having seen the same move over and over again). overall i think this is the best 3d match engine they have released. 2.) layout: for some reason they have decided to completly change the layout and all the menus etc. this is still p*ssing me off as the changes seem illogical and now takes me much longer to go to screens than before. i can see no reason for the change apart from for changes sake. it doesnt make things easier or quicker or more intuitive and generally just slows things down as it can take awhile to dig into sub menu after sub menu to look for the page you want. for existing fm2014 fans this may not have enough of a change to warrant a full price purchase but for players of older versions or new players i think the updated match engine do warrant the game for consideration. overall i do recommend the game as overall i find the fm series to be excellent, however note there are not a massive amount of changes compared to the last release.",119.7
"awesome game. still has some minor bugs but it can definately make you spend a lot of hours on it",294.0
"a few hours into the gameplay and 3/4ths of my team are out for 6 or more weeks... dont know if this a bug or not or just realistic that half of united are injured.",64.8
"only got this game yesterday and can i just say wow, always thought of getting footal manager but thought it not going to be to much different to fifa career mode, i am so wrong the levels of depth in the game is amazing, ive problerly played quite a few hours and have only played 3 competitive games so far it takes a long time to set up and manage the team but will be worthwhile soon must reccomend this game 10/10",8.8

"surprised by the amount of bad reviews. i havent experienced the vast amount of injuries and high score lines. admittedly, ive had a few high scoring games but ive also seen my fair share of 0-0s. there are some good little improvements with manager creation, more interaction with players and knock-on effects to other players and the squad overall. is it groundbreaking? no, but i dont think any fm game has been particulary groundbreaking over the past few years. again, there are some good improvements and additions to the game and if you have enjoyed previous fm games, youll enjoy this one too.",177.9
"ive played every single football manager game since the split from championship manager and every single championship manager before that and i have to say, this is the first time ive been massively disapointed in the series - it doesnt feel like fm, its a skewed imposter. some things around the game has improved in subtle ways - match day stadiums looks great, the scouting is more realistic than ever but the good ends there. the matchday engine has slowly become a joke over the years, tolerable but still worsening for the past 3 editions, this one being the worst. injuries are through the roof in this version (even after the hotfix tweaks) and its impossible to keep a players fitness up even with squad rotation. in addition to the injuries the goals are insane your team will score 100 goals a season with anichebe as your main attacking threat but youll also concede just as many with neuer as your keeper. tactics dont seem to matter all that much, after testing it seems the main factor is your familiarity with it. if its low youll drop easy wins without question as your defenders refuse to perform any type of tackle. in all i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone in its current state and i really hope si throw out some massive fixes/improvements and soon.",79.7

"i love football manager, but they really messed up with this version. the transfer screen is a mess and it is hard to find new players. everything has been hiden in strange menues and wen you finally find the thing you want to do, you cant remember where you found it. the live game is like watching a game with kids! it is not uncommen to see 8-9 players in a small area and noone can hit the ball. the keeper has two settings: catch every ball or drop everything. it is not uncommen to see your keeper jumping high and it takes forever to hit the ground again. that makes it so easy for the attackers to score. (it is not a bug its a feature)..... dont get me started with the freekicks! if your player has a higher rating then 1 i freeking you will score if it is nearer then 90 meters from the goal! oh i forgot about the demands from the players. i played my first season as brndby and 8... eight ing players demanden to be sold. that was devestating for the morale of the team, but come on! i cannot sell 8 players in one transfer period! at the end of every season do some different players demand to get sold, and they get angry, and so do the rest of the guys, if you do not let them accept an offer. not just any offer ooooh no, but a offer from the last transfer period. that is just plain stupid. you cannot sell a player in a closed marked! the game sucks bigtime. it is harder then ever, so even if you plays manchester united against bradford, you still are up for a huge chalenge! dont buy this game! its a mess and not worth the money! stay with fm14 i know i will undtil most of the bugs are fixed!",401.8

"thank god i only paid 5 for this, prasie the lord for gifts cards!! when playing fm13, i thought that these games were head and shoulders above any other football game in terms of the imersiveness and the elevel of realism. but the last two games since then have been truly discusting. i dont care about the graphics, thats not what the game is about, but the actual realism of the match engine is poor. what is going on with the goalkeepers this year?? about 10-15 of my conceded goals have come directly from rebounds from frankly rediculous saves from the keep, he will just parry the ball away from the most tame shot imaginable and stand there for about a year until the follow up from the opposition striker rolls it in. then he dives. injuries are something which many people are complaining about. i dont feel like my tactical changes have any efect on the game. match stats mean nothing. this is a real shame because i have a lot of time for si but im losing faith by the day. i feel like some things happen on the game just to make you more addicted, becasue lets be honest, its more addictive when your not winnimg, because you cant put the game down until you have sorted it. and why do you have a sudden drop in form ever jan or feb. every team has a bad patch, but i, aloong with many other players have unexplained drops in form where nothing you do can halt the slide. i could go on for hours but i cant be bothered to give anymore feed back because i dont think it makes any differenc so if this review does nothing more than let me take my anger out on it, then so be it",79.0
"the best version yet, many great new additions. the tactical side is more realistic and you need to make sure you get everything done properly from fitness, especially in pre-season to training and motiation to tactics or youll struggle to win. i have completed my first season and did the double. the best new addition though is australias ffa cup.",35.7

"this game deserves the nobel prize! well, it should deserves a big awards of some sort. the main reason is because of its compelling nature, no one will be able to hop off the fm15 train once they have set foot in. as a big football fan, it is an honour that i get to play and experience one of the most intricated and dedicated football simulation ever. so please if you are ever wondering what to do on a wet and stormy tuesday night, the best solution is to immerse yourself into what is known as fm15.",523.8

"nice game, nice interface, pretty accurate database. i always thought that it was a scissors, paper, rock game and i should just fine the thing to win all games but its not. the thing you do on the bench really affects the players on the field. the 3d is indeed pretty bad but for me it doesnt matter because i use 2d. if i wanted a graphical football game i would have chosen fifa instead. the initial version was full of bugs but now, with the latest updates, it feels good.",212.7
"rediculously addictive, but not without flaws. like the previous release, fm2015 tends to be unstable on anything other than windows. ive had limite success with home streaming. the interface is a bit clunky, and workflow in team management isnt entirely intuitive. that said, im enjoying the hell out of 2015. if 1) you know that football doesnt involve touchdowns and helmets 2) you know that a football is round and usually kicked, not egg-shaped and usually thrown 3) you know your 4-3-3 from your 4-2-3-1 from your 3-5-2 from your 4-4-2 diamond 4) teams are built, not bought 5) are masochistic enough to enjoy a management simulation then you will love this edition of the most famous sport management simulation on the planet. you know a game has made it into the public consciousness when a common insult when discussing tactical elements of the real sport is an accusion of being a keyboard manager that only knows football manager ;)",620.4

"ive been playing football manager since 2005. this is without a doubt the most frustrating and unrealistic installment purely because of a buggy game simulation. sit and watch the 3d matches being played and youll be impressed at some nice new animations, but the game being played infront of you will make you want to put your fist through your monitor... - strikers miss 90% of 1 on 1 chances. - chances that should result in a goal often dont and come around far too often than in real life. - defenders that wander all over the place and dont tackle. - wingers that seem content to run into defenders rather than cross/pass the ball even if a teammate is in tons of space. that just names a few. needs a patch. a big one.",118.3
"the beautiful game just ot a make over. after playing the series for a number of years now, i was expecting the same thing. yet it seems so much improved on things i didnt even know needed improving. 1 example is the competitions menu. it shows where you are in the league and cups. the staff are more helpful and i like the introduction to tunnel interviews. the 3d graphics now involve motion capture in them and look much improved. 1 thing that is really noticeable is tweaking a system. example, my false 9 striker was not getting any goals but i was winning games. i change him to poacher and he gets bucket loads. if you love football and you love the idea of managing your fave team, get this, its a no brainer.",189.5
"excellent game if you like football. easy to get into... very difficult to master. be warned..... free time is now a thing of the past and days playing this game will roll over into each other and before you know it, the next one is out!",128.8
"a lot of people over the years have hated certain new installments of football manager. however, for an addict who has been playing since the first cm came out everything is as beautiful as it should be every year - unless you play with the 3d graphics on, which is absolutely horrid but then again you can never go wrong with 2d. of course, there are some bugs during matches and some inequities but when youre a manager you know that life aint fair. keep on managing till you cry blood when you score with your underdog team against one of the big guys of football and have that mental  when your months of tactical work pays in the end. the best  that has been changed are the ui, scouting and the tactics panel. i absolutely love the new circular star things over the players in the tactics screen. im an fm addict so whatever you give me i will play but those of you who feel the same about it will surely love and play this game anyway. we need that fix yo.",419.7
"im playing fm since the old cm 2000/2001 every year and this is the worst fm ever!! half of the squad injured, the tactic did work in the first season but in the second and third i have results like in the lottery and i didnt change the whole squad only new players who plays fm knows that this is unrealistic to have such results when you u once have found your perfect tactic. this are the main bugs but there are a lot of more thats probably the lack of competition between the producers of football managers.",85.3
"love this game, not much difference from last year, and my cons are that im liverpool ,beat bayern munich 4-1 had like 20+ shots , beat chelsea 2-1 had 15+ shots played crystal palce my striker missed two sitters -this stiker has finshing of like 19, losted 3-1 there striker score hatrick with finshing of like 13 makes sence, i had 25+ shots they had 5 , 4 on target",156.2
"constant crashing issues, not just the game closing but also ends up closing steam. ive never had an issue running a fm game since now. this needs to be fixed",402.6
"good game, but you cant really compare it to other football games like fifa and pes. this is a very tactical game, and you can easely get fired, but overall a very good football game, ratings: graphics - 6/10 - nice interface and layout, but when you play a match, it isnt as good to look at. gameplay - 8/10 - tactical and very good! mods - 8/10 - nice amount mods and tweaks to this game, and they are working absolutley fine. overall - 6.7/10 (let me know to other things to judge) (i know of the youtubers footymanagertv and statapp, comment more people!)",13.2

"arrived today. was pretty excited... but feel a bit disappointed. the interface is awful! it is definitely not an improvement. the bos advertises new features, but fails to let you know they have removed a few features and made the interface virtually un-navigable!",76.4
"6 hours into this game, and i must admit, they really improved the game, a lot. game looks better, and feels better with the new layout, and the in-game matches are much more fluent, and nice-looking, compared to the earlier match engines. i usually spent 500 hours+ each year on football manager games, and this will be no different. game looks massively good, runs perfect, even though i have a huge database with 13 countries, and 34 leagues. well done, si. update: i am now 36 hours into the game, and i stand by my original review. the game is amazing, and really addicting, and thus far i havent really experienced any bugs. fantastic game.",210.9
"it wont even start on my computer. problem after problem. a waste of cash",50.5
"great game. veteran player of football manager series and i feel this game lives up to the football manager reputation. i got it at christmas time so missed reported bugs that now mainly seem to be fixed. as ever match engine can be tweaked to make it better but overall football manager 2015 will provide many hours of fun.",111.0
"this game, in a word, is *addictive*. i find myself losing hours to this spreadsheet simulator, which to all my better judgement seems to be a random number generator which calculates football scores, completely detatched from the rest of the tactical, managerial business behind the scenes. and yet there is a chance that the tweaks you make to the team that lost 2-1 last time away to brentford, would transform the team into chelsea beaters and take you to the fa cup final and win glory for your beloved team. and that emotional empathy this game creates is as close to the real thing as watching a real football match on the tv. superb.",101.0
"my game is not working give me your saport.........",188.1
"hi, pro : all the stuff that was shown by developers previous was done: interface, coach experiance, etc... negative : there are 2 thing that i consider really bad, game results and percentage of shoots on goal, i am wining and loosing games tennis stile, i am wining with 7-0 but also loosing with 7-4... for this, i wouldnt recommend still fm2015 because, beside the updated database, the game is still not a decent evolution form fm2014.",273.9
"what can i say? the game is awesome way more tricky and challenging than the last few years. if you enjoy football then grab this game.",206.1
"waited til christmas to get it cheaper. dont see what the fuss is about, the game works fine and the ui is more intuitive. i played cm through to fm for over 10 years, although ive been skipping a few since it became fm. all those who complained about injuries and letting it soft goals are just not playing it right. i managed to clear all injuries several times, to a point where my backup/rotational players were complaining that they werent playing enough games. as for gameplay, i havent experienced any atrocious situations that a lot of reviews described. set your tactics and preparations right, get good coaches, manage your players motivation, and ration your training. you shouldnt encounter silly problems.",96.7
"i changed my mind about this game. yes, its about injuries. the injuries are annoying. so annoying. many my players injured. after one player return to training, one other player injured. yes, its injury simulator for now.",154.3
"i very bored with engine. i cant win trophy if iforget save before match. ai very cheat. i never played more than 30 minute per time. because i angry with engine. and i sayi will not buy football maneger again",239.9
"liking it, changes to the game are subtle and things i cant be bothered with like press and training are far too repetitive but in saying that it has it good points, the over feel of the game is good, with the new ui they have made a lot of improvments. a word to the developers, think big, rather than loads of small improvments you guys need to go for a big leap, try and give us regular customers something to get excited about, stadium design or being able to create a club from scratch in the lower leagues of a country and make it a real force over 10 seasons+. but all in all, if your a fan of the series then youll be happy with this...",260.8
"got the game on saturday, lost about 17 hours in these past three days to the game. abandoned all social obligations trying to get leeds united to the premier league. currently sitting comfortably in 8th place in the championship at around january. havent been this addicted to an fm like this before. i wont stop until i get leeds up or i get sacked. 10/10 feeling sleep deprived, yet slighlty content with my efforts in the game. liam marching on together",24.8
"i have played the last 3 football manager games and football manager 2015 is an improvment it more challenging then the last but at the same time it not impossible to win titles with the smallest club thanks to the complex match engine it all about how you use this game to get the most out of it 9/10",386.5
"i recommend this game. i love football maneger, and this one its one of the best. some bugs of course, but nothing to worry about with.",57.2
"not sure there are bug or not.. but average booked 4yellow card per match. wth btw overall still is a good game.",292.5
"generally its a good game, but there is way too many unrealistic results in the game. for an example i played a game where i was man utd against spurs and i won it 10-7. i also think that there is scoring way too many goals by crosses and rebound goals, but i also think that they have improved the game. there is a lot more features in football manager 15. for an example i think that it is great that i can see my own manager skills and i also think that the jobinterviews has gotten a lot better and more realistic. but there is still too many unrealistic things in the match simulator, that i really hope they will improve. from a scale from 1-10 ill give it 6 :-)",506.8
"look, no game can be perfect. yes there are some issues with the new interface and match engine, but for a simulator such as this, fm is frankly amazing. overall, i have to say that football manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all football fanatics. if you are a past fm player and have been dissapointed with past versions, i honestly beg you to revisit your perspective and try out fm15 (please..)! it is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money. 9/10",105.6

"i have play fm since 2007 and totally fall in love with this game. the last year sega release fm14 which is the worst in my opinion. but they release fm15 and i think its better than the old one, i love the new skin, although the match engine not much better but overall i recomended this game",433.6
"when you see your gk stop the ball from going out for a goal kick and tap it to the opponents striker, its time to say rip football manager, you used to be a good game. now if youll excuse me, ive got much better things to do like watching paint dry.",431.4

"a good game but has a few issues (e.g. clean sheets). takes a bit of time to get used to the new layout. overall a worthwhile buy but if you have football manager 2014 it may be worthwhile to wait until football manager 2016 is released.",317.5
"absoutely love the new interface. only thing i dont like is that there is a large emphasis on scouting this year, much much more so than last years edition.",123.4
"as a seasoned fm gamer & previously cm, i am hugely dissapointed with the match engine, i have yet to go three straight games without either a goalkeeping howler/ glitch (for either side) & atleast once a game the keeper will push a ball onto the post where the ball will stop dead to either a slide tackle goal or slide tackle clearance. coupled with 6 strate game in which 2 or more goals were conceded in the last ten mintes with the stench of innevitability. unfortunately due to our loyalty there is no major competitor in site that i could recommend either so you will probably just buy it anyway . . . as i did . . . . and will probably will again",213.7
"another crap fm , its got worse and worse every year",63.4
"absolutely awful game. it makes no difference who you play, who you sign, or how you play, you will end up having a ridiculous amount of shots on/off target. (most games in the high teens or even 20s) and still somehow lose. theres no such thing as consistancy in the game at all (beat athletico madrid with liverpool 3- 0 then subsequently went on to lose to burnley and stoke with same team/tactics for example) i had the same issues with the previous game but thought id give this one a go anyways. i regret my decision massively. 20 down the drain. i wouldnt buy this game again if it was 2. do youself a fabour and avoid this game like the plague.",86.1

"couple things need tweaking, some games it like every shot is a goal, injurys can go from 1 a week to 3 or 4 a game for weeks on end, i like a lot of the new features and new side bar, but also find it hard to find some things , i played this game since before the orignal split of devolpers on the amiga and been a fan ever since the very 1st championship manager and stayed with the devolpers who make football manager since, there is still a few features i would love to see added , but maybe in next years they might get added, but would say for any football fan this is a must , either managing fleetwood town or man city , or some team in india, this game has something for every football fan , bye bye outside and hello football manager :d",281.7
"crash dump everytime. waste of money as cant play it. had the same problem with fm05 or 06 but at least with those you could get a few seasons out of it",108.3
"i have had football manager since 2010, enjoyed playing iit greatly for years. i enjoyed the ability to micromanage the little things in the game mainly the sliders. if my team was getting scored on a great deal move thedefensive line slider back a few notches of which i had twenty. a few years ago they decided to do away with the sliders but keep them optional to simplify the game. fine i still have them... the last few years completly gone, and its obvious to anyone who plays the game that the system is exactly the same, the player and team instructions are still moving sliders in the background. so i am at the point where i am just not interested in the game anymore, i am sure there are people out there that like to tinker and micromanage their games, people that enjoy games like europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2. football manager has been one of my favorite games i hope they can listen to their fans and bring back what we all loved about the game.",42.7

"ive played every fm (and champ manager before they split) and while some have set the bar low and some have had glitches, this is by far the worst. both single and multiplayer games seem to have the worst ai ive ever seen passes going off in random directions at least 10-15 times per match and every match win lose or draw in multiplayer having at least 6-8 goals. i pre-ordered and am really dissapointed that i did, i expect subsequent patches to vastly improve the quality of the gameplay but in the meantime id have to say dont buy this until its fixed. we have given up our usual multiplayer game because it is almost unplayable.",125.9

"well in my opinion this is by far the best football manager to date. the graphics on the 3d match are really good the gameplay seems alot smoother goalkeepers actually make really good saves. ive seen alot of people moaning about the beta version what you all need to understand is the whole point of this is so any problems that do occor you let them no they fix it and to be fair there are a few faults. 1. theres way to many injuries within pre season. 2. theres been to many times when the ball is in the box and the strikers or defence dont really do anything about it too many realistic goalscoring chances missed. 3. ridiculous transfer fees i no in fm14 it was the same but it seems unless you have 40 million to spend on one half decent player then you aint getting a half decent player. theres a few more things but i reckon the developers will fix all this before the game is actually released so im not worried. its well worth the money and if your a die hard football manager player then once this little things are fixed youll love it.",272.3
"could be better. its not that bad, but it may not be worth purchasing if you already own fm14. dont bother buying the in-game editor dlc, the freeze attributes option will magically untick every once in a while. besides it kills the enjoyment of the game to make all a players attributes 20.",577.9

"i have played fm/cm since 2001 and this honestly is the worst one, i cant understnad why si would release a game thats not finished (other than miles jackobsons inapt abillity to ajust). i waited a few weeks to buy the game after seeing lots of negatives about it but thought it cant be that bad - well unfortunately it is. i dont know where to start, the graphics are terrible and cartoon like (i have a top spec pc amdfx8350 radeon r9 series graphics) the injurys are beyond a joke, im getting 3 or 4 serious injurys every game. the oi tactic screen doesnt work which is a joke. said screen is now on the tactics tab but when you set the oi it doesnt do anything in the game build up beacuse you have to renter the oi anyway before the team talk. you cant adjust the finances and budgets anymore (why remove it? seriously) and little things like .tac files can no longer be applied to the game. i hate to say it but this is a step back not a step foward for fm. im so dissapointed.",239.7
"unfortunately the makers of fm have not learnt from their mistakes last time. they have yet again released a game with so many bugs there is no point buying the game until around february when all the patches have been released to correct the bugs. the testing process before the game is issued is terrible - is there actually one at all?. this could be such a good game, but is really bad. and they insist on players using this ridiculous steam platform to run the game through. hate it.",9.9
"really dont understand how the me gets worse. 2012 was ok, just needing a bit of tweaking. 2013 onwards have been shocking, with the latest being the worst. i fully understand that fm is a management simulator, and that si will say it isnt meant to be fifaesque in terms of graphics etc., but that isnt my gripe. the major issue i have with the me is what you see happening in no way relates to your instructions or the stats at the end. for example, you concede too many from balls over the top, so you set the team to defend deeper. but when you are viewing the match, the back four are still in the halfway line. what is the point in having the facility to change something if the me doesnt reflect that change? same with ratings; a keeper drops one into his own net then kicks a ball stright to the opposition to score. his rating is a 7. from what i see, he is at fault for two goals, yet if i discipline or drop him, he thinks its unwarranted as the stats say he played well. nothing you see happening relates to stats. some of the interplay is laughable. world class players look like baby deer trying to kick a ball and the decision making completely at odds with what players (especially good ones) would do in those situations. only real benefit of th game its updated database. aside from that its a poor imitation of previous versions. save your money",136.7

"you can have even more control over your players during the game",273.2
"the most frustrating fm ever. can batter teams and still lose. have a 3 goal lead, winning easily and then somehow draw. im afraid its all too predictable. for example, was getting beat at home 3-1 by spurs. clawed it back to 3 a piece but i knew it was going to let them score a winner in the 90th minute and it did. really unimpressed and wish i never bothered buying it. if youre thinking about buying it stick with fm2014 because this version is piss poor.",78.6

"i see all these negative reviews about fm 2015. and i strongly disagree with most of them. first of all yeah there are a decent amount of injuries during a season. i played quite a few seasons and after looking the average amount of injuries that occure both ingame and in real. i must say it has been made quite realistic. the amount of injuries i got a season appear to be just below the average in real. so i must say this is quite good. the amount of own goals has been a big complaint aswell but compare it with the amount the average top team of each league gets it is just a bit more than in real. that is mainly because in real they dont count everything a own goal that has been last touched by a defending player while fm 2015 does. i could go on for a while with ruining peoples their complaints but in general this version of fm is better than all of the previous ones. the menu is amazing now and the possibilities are endless.",287.7
"im having a love-hate relationship with this version of the game. theres some stuff to love, and a bit more to hate. but heres the main points: pros: +switching between two teams when managing a club and country is easier +considerably more realistic +sidebar, and game in general, is neat. everything is tidy, easy to look at, easy to find cons: -the team selection screen is so, so clunky -3d match engine is still awful. i still play on 2d because i cannot deal with the mistakes that will happen on 3d, like defenders passing in to their own net far more regularly than irl",168.2
"will probably be the last football manager i buy, been playing since champ 01/02 and maybe ive been playing fm for too long but the game is just too easy, can take a team from league 2 to the champions league in 5/6 years almost everytime, in lower leagues you can pickup players on free transfers 2 leagues above the standard you play, in the prem you pickup players from argentina/brazil for 4m and sell them for 30m at the end of the season, not fun for me anymore",506.8
"i feel fm 15 to be exceptional i believe the match engine to be very modern and that the new user interface is revolutionary.i played the beta which i found brilliant,but there were some probs but im glad to say they have been fixed for the full game. i was falling away from fm for a bit dispite play each of the last 5 but fm15 has brought me right back to why i fell in love with football manager",428.2

"playing fm since 2000/2001. the series is my favourite of all time across all genres. the last 3 years however the game has been getting gradually more of an exercise in ambigious tedium than the magical gaming experience it used to be. i appreciate the people at si need to change the game to justify the price tag, i just dont know why they insist on breaking the game to do so. i can only hope the truly awful new features (im looking at you tactics screen) will be patched. they wont though, way too much pride. god what ive give for the return of slide bars. id also love some explanation, no matter how vague, for how the 10 million different variables that can affect the outcome of a match actually work. im certain si changed the way things like tempo work in game for different tactics without mentioning it or eve updating the tips bar. poor form. moreover, having touchline shouts, pressers, player interaction, 3 teamtalks its too much, and its for the most part very very boring. as for the me just like with fm14 and 13 at release, its broken. you would think after 2 poor mes at release si would have the integrity and self respect to deliver this year... i remember when si used to release games that didnt need a single patch. i think the monopoly si have over the genre has made them complacent, its only natural i suppose. do not purchase until they have fixed the game. maybe in mid march 2 months before the season ends :d",299.5
"not as good as previous years. the layout is not simple, illogical format in certain situations. but, still love the concept of the game, and so always play it; but the previous years are much better!",230.6
"thank you sports interactive for supplying with my latest yearly dosage of stress and sleep deprivation. my goalkeeper could not catch ebola in sierra leone and my midfielders do as good a job of controlling the ball as the world health organisation controlling the spread of it. same thing as every year but will still play it because i am hopelessly addicted and socially frustrated. 21/10",426.0
"always love the football manager series and like the new features on fm 15. alot have complained about the match engine but with the latest update and a tweak of your tactics you can games with no issue. maybe some have an issue with only using one tactic for every match which is never going to work given the improved ai.",349.3

"thoroughly enjoyable and easy to get stuck into great game for me.",582.0
"been playing this game for more then 15 years, from back when it called championship manager, this will be the last year i bought it, there are almost no improvements and i am deeply dissapointed in that, i was a big fan.",415.1
"terrible, why is it that game makers have to go one step forward and a million back, the graphics are poor quality, stadiums are ok, too many injuries, too many red cards match engine is poor quality, think i might go back to fm 2014 as it was much better than this crud.",114.7
"ive owned cm/fm since the early nineties and would reccomend this edition. its a big improvement on last years edition. match engine is better than its been for a while. football manager classic has also improved and is a welcome break from the full fat edition, a bit like the cm of old that was fast paced. biggest con is still the media press conferences, been in the game for a while now and they are complete crap.",654.7
"i really want to like this game, but i just cant! was a waste of 30 if im honest. ridiculous scorelines, too many injuries, the referees are far to card happy and they constantly give stupid penalties. the match engine is rubbish and abit predictable at times. the game is overcomplicated in certain areas. im forcing myself to play it due to the fact it cost 30 and thats 30 im not prepared to let go for nothing! i just cannot recommend this game at all!!",20.7
"its just not ready. i really like the new look, sidebar, scouting, match graphics its all very nice. its going to be a great game. its playable but i wouldnt start a long term save until some of the problems get sorted out. injuries, for some, are out of control. crosses are overpowered, too many long range shots, too many goals a lot of 5-0, 7-4 games. every year you get a release that needs to be patched before you can fully enjoy it. this year is no different. you see a lot of people upset and give bad reviews, understandable. if i paying for a game i want a finished product. im half way into a chelsea save and have seen a lot of injuries early when the players were out of shape, training was heavy and tactics were fast. after some tweaking they stopped. i am seeing overpowered crosses, terry scores a hattrick! some high scoring games. once those issues get patched, hopefully soon and not feb, which seem to be just adjustments this game is going to be a great game. buy it, check out the new features, get all your pics and logos ready, test out tactics and play a few test games so youll be ready.",195.0
"this game sucks! in the match mode players will just stand and let the opposition get the ball. goalkeepers will let the ball slip through them, not just once but this happens virtually every game, which it just wouldnt in the premier leauge. defenders just dont tackle and let players run past them. whatever good work si have done in the past few years has been un-done by this abomination!",268.0
"honestly theyve had problems this year. cons: - horrible goalkeeping - atrocious defensive positioning - lackluster finishing - corner glitches - cannot win headers - you can 65 shots and still end the game without a goal. - your opponents only need one shot to score - key players gets mad because you sold a player with no potential - ronaldo and jese are willing to join arsenal after i finished 6th in my first and second season.... cant see that happening in real life .... .... .... and worst of all once i start a game it gets boring really quickly (though thats my problem). pros: - its a football game",459.8
"i have alway been a fan of football manager, when igo t this game i was dead excited. if there is anyone who enjoys taking control of tactics, training and team talks and is avid football fan then i wojld recomend this game as its enjoyable and challenging at the same time.",170.9
"i would heavily reccomend this years version of football manager. in my opinon it is quite a bit better than last years version. the bugs in the match engine have been fixed and it plays better than ever. the new ui is nice and slick, very useable and saves me a lot of time. the biggest improvement is the scouting system though, its much more dynamic and genuinley interesting compared to before.",482.4
"this is way better than football manager 14, where you had to get a perfect start for your club or get sacked within a couple of months! ive played so many games and havent been sacked by cellino yet.",157.3
"worst fm ever. dont buy ! even on sale. there is nothing to enjoy, nothing realistic. yes, theres good new features i think. but the fundemantels are missing. im a fm fan for like 15 years, i played every version of it and i say there is no fun and no realism. only thing youll experience in this game injuries. 5 in one match or 3 players goes between matches etc. im telling you dont throw your money out and dont buy this one..",67.9
"awesome game as always, football manager 15 is the best fm so far , keep it up :d! any old fm fan should get this !",0.2
"top eleven was my introduction to football sim, i really liked the concept but always wanted to do more. well football manager delivers. i always go in thinking, ill only play one week worth of games, but stick around for hours!! the only complain that i have is the fact the fact that players always want to leave because im not matching their ambition? we just got promoted twice show some loyalty!! hahaha but thats what happens in real life doesnt it? highly recommend it to those fifa players that try to play career mode but its not enough.",109.5
"my girlfriend says why this... it i dont have a girlfriend, but i am a successful and rich manager 1000/10",197.3
"its wierd at first and the default skin is terrible but after a few hours into it you start to get used to it. scouting is actually allot more important than ever now and you go into your scouting tab in order to search for players that are transfer listed etc, based on your scouting knowledge. you can see how everything is working allot more now and makes it important to have feeder clubs from different countries to improve scouting knowledge across the globe. touchline instructions are cool in theory but i found it to be pointless and makes your team worse off, just stick with the pre match and half time team talks. match engine is allot better and it feels more fluid with the animations however are there some dodgy stuff that happens especially when 2 or 3 defenders are trying to chase down a loose ball then none of them end up getting it and leave it whilst a surging striker latches onto it and scores when they shouldent of had any chance of getting it. the only bad thing really for me is the default skin but thats a personal thing, as for the game its solid and a solid upgrade. if youve not got a fm game for a while then deffo pick this up, if you get them every year then you should see more improvements this year than you have the previous years to warrent getting it aswell.",314.4
"ever get excited during a transfer window? ever wanted to build and manage a world class team? look no further, another great tweeked version of fm.",232.9

"buen juego... pero lamentablemente los resultados de los partidos estan tocando lo ridiculo. hubo partidos que gane 8 a 0. y el mismo dia hubo resultados de 6 a 4 y 7 a 5 esto es futbol o tenis?. deben corregir esto y pronto porque sinceramente te quita las ganas de jugar. good game... but sadly the match results are ridiculous. there were some games that i won 8 - 0. and in the same day there were some final results like 6-4 and 7-5 is this futbol or tennis?. they should fix this soon because honestly... after this issue nobody wants to keep playing the game.",180.0
"10/10. this game has ruined more of my hours than anything else.. have been playing football manager games even before steam ! absolutely sucks you in. the best part is when the players you scouted and picked up in game for cheap become super stars in real life :)",167.8

"actually feel ive been robbed of 30 and angry enough to bother posting a first review. dont think ive played a cm/fm game thats been this broken before. ive tried playing lower and higher division teams (started 4 games so far and struggled to play even a couple of regular season games) but there doesnt seem to be any consistency in how tactics/ players affect a game. to think i quit my most recent fm14 game 13 seasons in for this...",223.1
"this game is the worst football manager so far. the steam engine is very poor and i cant contact steam support to help me with any of my issues. i uninstalled the game and tried to reinstall it but it says its already purchased so i cant even see if that works. the maintenance on the game is shocking the previous games have never been this bad i will strongly consider never going near steam ever again after this shambles id recommend everyone stay away from this game if you have no time for terrible help and no maintenance.",858.0
"this needs fixing! match engine totally sucks guys, worst 30 spent ever on a game!! well dissapointed, i feel as though ive been ripped off :(. just not enjoyable at the moment, fix it si do not buy!! bring back championship manager.....and now after the latest update patch (27/11/14), my game keeps on crashing!?! i didnt have no problem with this before the patch!!!! and i dont see any improvement whatsoever on the pathetic goals being scored, op crosses still prevelent, injuries still there (every game) match engine still messed up, so what exactly did the latest patch do ???? because im confused as to what you have improved?",123.3
"i cant enable in game community to access the in game editor. can someone help?",152.2
"the ui takes a lot of getting used to, even if youre a veteran fm player. even the best players in the world seem to struggle to play properly, for some reason. i dont believe they really went above and beyond with fm15, but it is still an addition to the franchise. its decent but not leaps and bounds above fm14. if you are just getting into the series, pick it up. if you already own fm14 and want a new challenge, its pretty good for that too. i would recommend it.",254.7
"i have to start this review by saing i have had every version since the championship manager 92/93 game on my old amiga 500 i loved the football manager games since they split in 2005 i think the first title was i have logged 1000s off hours over the last 10 years although this one not so much! i have this title but oh boy oh boy this game has caused me to file for divorce as off the other day i could not believe what happened ok i was 7-0 up at half time with arsenal in the champions league play off 1st leg against some obscure european side i cant pronounce let alone even attempt to spell and what do you think happened by full time????? thats right it finished 7-7 i turned the game off and will not be returning to it also there is the constant injuries and know matter how good your team is or how great ur tactics are u will lose to the worst teams constantly i mean if this is how the future of football manager is heading i for one will not be returning in the future. save your money!",99.2
"still very buggy and some of the player positioning in the match engine is just plain horrible. i would recommend waiting for them to patch this a bit more before shelling out your cash unless you are a complete football manager tragic like me.",313.6
"well, after fm 14 i didnt think that m going to buy another fm but i decided to give it another chance. and i m proud of my decision. even in beta its a better game than fm 14. interface is nice and clean with a lot of information. scouting is really good. and match engine is really smooth with motion capture. even in beta this game is the best fm game ever.",186.2
"constant runtime errors, have done everything recommended to fix the problem but it still persists after a few games. there are problems with this game every single release i had decided not to buy this year as it is a total pain every year waiting for all the bugs to be fixed. as usual it will be january before the game is playable..............stop releasing broken games.",843.5

"it all comes together after years of being a wierd disjointed experience.",253.9
"if you have played the others your soon know how addictive these games become, in terms of is it better than 2014? well at first its not simply because of getting used to the new layout but once you master this then yes all the way. better player interaction and match engine, and simply more behind the scenes as well to tweak. the staff on this game have been improved and how you utilise them, while still providing a challenging experience. 10/10",221.7
"the most realistic version yet to real life football. i have played every version of the fm franchise and this is the best yet. im looking forward to the next installment of the fm franchise. im currently using the barclays premier league swapped with the conference north/south by kingpazza (goldenfm) as i think its the best database on the steam workshop and well with checking out.",733.5

"apparently someone who makes the match engine died because the whole ing thing is a disaster. the most realistic football simulation game offers realistic scorelines such as 7-3, 6-2, and ive even seen an 8-8 draw. defending is non existent. goalkeepers take about 10 minuites to get up after they make a save and the whole thing is just broken. i lost 5-0 when my team had 15 shots 6 on target and they had around 5 shots 3 on target. 2 of them were own goals and the rest were rebounds from the keeper. if you call that realistic i have no idea what league you are looking at. i hate when people say its your tactics; ive tried every tactic possible just to get some results and nothing works. i started about 3 saves now. i like the new layout and the game mechanics. but the match engine is godawful and unfinished to the point where i question if its a football game. why the  is the match engine so bad when it was amazing on fm14? go back to 14 everybody where you can get realistic scorelines. tl;dr , nobody can score, nobody can defend, goalkeepers are apparently disabled. dont buy it until a patch comes out.",386.4
"new patch, urgently! change the match engine to make the game playable.",397.9
"to easy to score frome crosses i dread the ball coming in the box i hope they fix this as it really spoils the game. otherwise i would recommend the game",87.7
"when reading about the reviews of this game i thought it would be bad but it is acutally very fun and isnt as bad",67.5
"good game, plays well. there arent too many injuries as some have suggested, nor is it too difficult. with a well devised tactic and a solid training plan, success is very possible. having said that, there is now a bug that prevents the loading of the game at all. steam yet again is proving to be an utter abortion of an application. why on earth im compelled to use this third party trash to load my game is completely beyond me.",329.1

"cant seem to get started again after beta version but was good upto that point!",200.3
"ive been playing this game since i was a child and i cant say anything bad and wrong about it. this seasons version, is way more faster than the others, more realistic, and more difficult. which is good. be aware of the gamers saying that is too difficult, the havent understood the beauty of this game at all, yet. if you like football, this is s must have and a must play!",363.6

"only complaint for fm15 is ridiculous prices for players tried to buy shaquri from bayer and they wanted 67 million no way is he worth that 15-20 max ,then tried to buy kovacic from inter and they wanted 51 and lucas leiva this is ruining the game with stupid prices hope they can sort this out",241.5

"football manager 2015 is the best version yet of the greatest football management game on earth. it takes you deeper than ever into the world of football management and is extremely addictive. the best feature is the 3d match view allowing you to see your players on the pitch actually score goals. keep up the good work sports interactive, and lets hope the 2016 version is even biggedr and better.",603.8
"buy this game, hire roy keane as assistant manager. this game have done something completely new to the series. it has managed to perfectly capture the personality of roy keane. im so amazed at how everything this game makes him say or do matches reality 100%. the brutality of his tactical advices, his ability to motivate, his no-nonsense way of dealing with reporters. also, hes a mental coach, so theres the fitful juxtaposition roy keane (mental) in every advice tab. ive not had any bugs, and everything is running smoothly! great game!",283.3

"this is the worst fm of all time. i think the designers should burn in hell.",217.5
"played football manager since its inception in 84 on the zx spectrum, this is one of the worst in the series for multiple reasons. the devs seem to have the notion of more is constantly better whilst getting the fundamentals of the game which always stood it above the rest completely wrong. i have thousands of hours in football manager games and never been compelled to write a negative review. although playable is not great, the series has gone downhill the last few years in my opinion.",117.7

"its good. everyone complaining that its the same game, thats the case every year. i dont know why some people want or expect an entirely different game, personally i would be upset if they drastically changed things. pros: -new and improved graphics and animations -requires real tactical planning, simply throwing top players out there without careful strategic planning will result in losses -improved, more streamlined interface (except for the tactics screen for some reason they made it worse and you have to click more stuff) -improved scouting and player potential system -improved training options -its m f ing football manager cons: -tactics screen is worse now -some early bugs (will be fixed in the coming months most likely) -too many goals are scored from set pieces -some wonky things with the match engine, players kick balls directly in to players in front of them way too often, and the ball will ping-pong off of players randomly too much in the box",717.8

"in spite of what people have said, i would say this is a very intuitive and interesting addition to the series.",206.1
"where do i begin. i have been trough it all lately. inevitable injuries to key players, constant leaking goalies, the ridiculous crossing goalies, 7-4 defeats to non-league teams that i should have stomped on and of course some disasterous defending by my players ai. but still i come back to it again and again. hitting my head against the same bloody brick wall day after another. and for some reason it has worked. i have had couple of saves which have gone fantastically so far. the ai still is kinda  but way better than at launch. new additions such the sidebar and more in-depth scoutin have taken a another small step towards realism and i feel like the abnoxious pre and after game journalist mlestations are easier to handle. so i am going to give it a recommendation for what it is, but please make the game properly and dont leave it all for beta testers to get trough i had one save on the beta and it was abnoxious and almost unplayable. it might have ruined the game for some players before it even came out.",780.4

"is this worth your purchase? yes is it worth your purchase if yopu have fm2014? no so bottom line you get your normal squad updates etc. they has been a change of the screens but really you get the same information just presented in a slight diffrent way. the 3d engine is the best improvment its fine to watch now but still not perfect. so yes i like this game but kinda wished i had spent my money on something else as for me this is not a massive upgrade to last years. this is just my thoughts and you might think diffrent. its your choice.",80.9
"very addicting game, love every minute of it. if you love football, you will love this game. although this years version takes some getting used to, i definitely rate it higher than fm14.",769.9
"based on beta - played all games since day 1 and most have had there issues but then its very hard to wipe out all problems with such a variation of methods. nothing i would class as gaming breaking occured and any issues with 3d engine can generally be ignored or altered tactics wise to suit. easily the best and most comprehensive version thus far, much improvement to gui, scouting etc and requires more patience when lower league. think all the changes are for the better and enjoying new challenge of working out all the new nuances and mechanics.",606.5

"so far so good. lots of new features to play with. couple of downsides so far though; new layout seems more cluttered than before. stock skin is horrible on the eyes, hoping someone makes a nice clean skin like fm2014 was. easy on the eyes. playing as a club with red as a primary colour if very difficlut to do. as are some of the other colours. not so bad with white.",100.3
"this game is really atrociously bad. tactics are stupid, the players are stupid and what can you say about the match-engine.... is just action after reaction after reaction - ask your team to tackle a player hard - get sent off after 2 min - go 2 up - get 2 pegged back - then score 3- 2 - or go 2 down - peg 2 back - then lose 3-2 - teamtalk, press conferences - whats the point of it all... seriously - i want my money back - the last good fm was also the first one - 2005... 10 years of garbage and its just keeps getting worse by every year - i will never buy fm again.",9.9

"i love this game and have been playing it for around 12 years. although i do enjoy this version there is still alot wrong with it. the game day match engine is just not good enough and if it doesnt improve they should just revert back to the old days of watching circles run around the pitch. the stats for your manager at the beginning mean nothing as i won promotion with sheffield wednesday and the following season i was outside the relegation zone and looking like staying up (my objective was to fight against relegation) and they still sack me. additional to this i was making the team money. this has happened to me twice with two seperate teams. the stats i choose at the beginning were for a top manager and there is no way a team in that situation in real life would sack a top manager in that position. the top clubs sign all the best players but these players would not be happy to be sat on the bench and not playing games at all, just not realistic). and the amount of injuries i am faced against, at one point i had 8 of my first team players out for 2 months or more. like i said i do like the game though and will continue to play the gaem. i just hope our comments are heard and the game next year is better than ever and back to its origins at the top of the pile for its genre.",163.8

"i absolutly love football manager and have spent many hours ticking away the hours playing these games. with fm15 the developers have reverted to the sidebar which foir me seemed a step in the wrong direction but after a few weeks of getting used to it its fine many hardcore fmers would argue it spoils the layout but this change i believe is a good one. now to the game itself! fm15 lets get the bad bits out of the way..i say bad its not that bad but the match engine is still in the finetuning stage. from fm 13 which is the last fm i played it has been completly overhauled which in my opinion is a gamble but there is progress and its going forward allbeit slowly..lets not mention the nearpost corner glitch and stupid idiotic backpasses that go out for a corner, all that aside its a work in progress. football manager is about progress, not revolution, which is arguably what its audience wants, and exactly what this years game provides.",867.7
"pros -new ui (while it may take some getting used to its superior to the old one) -scourting (much better and more realistic than the old system also great new scouting reports) -stadium view with banners -chatting with players board journalists etc improved -new tactics creator much better both vissually and technically cons -need some patching -goalkeepers seems to be completely useless (even the top ones) plus their reactions in 3d game engines reminds me of kidengarden kids tring to goalkeep (they make me wanna go to 2d games again). -the new generic logos for the non lincenced leagues are bad (guess well have to wait for workshop to fix)",45.4
"some improvements here and there, but generally a step backwards. in game engine sucks, players get hurt constantly and even the in-game editor i paid 5 bucks for isnt working at the moment. a buggy mess and i hope to get some value out of the purchase after they finally fix their issues.",126.4

"so i have played fm15 after previously having the 2013 and 2008 versions. when i got my self on the 2013fm i saw a lot of changes between it and 2008. the 2015 hardly brought any changes at all. there are maybe 2 or 3 new speches in team talk, some more advanced conversations with players which are actualy harder to talk to and overal the personal chat has been developed. yes theres also a 3d game play shown rather than 2d which actualy does not add anything to a manager expirience and in my opinion is nice but unnecesary. there are few minor bugs with the game, theres also a fair play requirements to get into european competitons but other than that theres not a lot of new suprises. this is still my favourite football manager game but other than few little changes, updated squads and competition rules this game is preety much the old 2013 manager to me. its still a good game worth a buy if your upgrading your football manager 6/10. just because i expected a bit more new features. 10/10 if this is going to be your first one or much older than 2013.",853.2
"still not realistic considering what you see on the pitch. but still, the best manager game there is by far.",221.2
"man alive there is a lot of goals and injuries in this game. the match engine makes your players look like theyre skating on ice. most my games finish 5-3. 4-3 etc. if im down 2-0 at half im not all that worried cause theres a chance i might score 4 goals in the 2nd half. i hope they fix some of these issues in the january update.",51.6
"dont be put off by all the helpful negative reviews, they were made when it was still in beta/just after beta. the game is very good, and i have found it to be the most enjoyable game yet. the 3d match engine has been slightly imporved (players do skills, back heels), and the layout is just aesthetically pleasing.",291.5
"where to start...its a fantastic game, just like the previous however this one adds a bit more immersion with the team talks. for example i was 1-0 down to hull at halftime with west ham, i drilled into the lads and as it happens with got the equalizer howeer i wanted more, i wanted the 3 points to pursue the league title. i clicked the team talk tab and aggressiely demanded more from the lads and out of nowhere mark noble with a fantastic volley from a corner rattled it home giving me a 2-1 win. at the end of the day if youre an fm fanatic why havent you bought this? and if youre looking for a new challenging strategy game and you have an undying love for football then look no further and purchase this beauty and get into it as i can guarentee you the next one will be better and more advanced!",336.8
"way too many injuries. played as manchester united as my first save as is tradition. before my first game of the season falcao, rvp, rooney, mata, di maria, jones and de gea were all injured. this carried on throughout the entire season.",177.6
"im managers fan since world soccer on atari 65xe and i have solid history with all cm/fm series releases. with all that i can assure you this version of fm is another milestone ( somehow like fm 2008 was ). at the start of beta/early access the game was a bit buggy and match engine needed a lot of tweeks but yet another time si and their team step up to the challenge and actualy listen to the community. in last 14 days they hotfixed most of the issues and game is very enjoyable. surely the most realistc one to date. cant wait for todays release to play with my friend on multiplayer. if you are series fan you cant miss it. match engine is fun to watch, game is pretty challenging, and once again you can feel almost like a harry redknap or sam alardyce standing next to the touchline. my score is 92/100 - if multiplayer will turn out to be bug-free then its 99/100 cheers.",657.7
"its like fifa but take away you controlling the players and you actually have to think on how to win games 10/10",16.5
"cant actually load it for the minute. will post a proper review when i can!",16.3
"ive purcahsed every football maanger since 2011 and i have to say this one is unplayable! the amount of injuries which as far as i can tell they dont plan on fixing is rediculous. i wont be opening this game again and going back to football manager 14",335.0
"they should actually try to make a good 3d so we could watch the games instead of just reading the comments or watching balls vs balls :p and the injuries ... anyway i enjoy 90% of the time playing it so its cool :)",524.8
"jos mourinho just won premier league with chelsea in 2015, then decides to apply for everton manager vacancy only to end up at napoli. carlo ancelotti leaves real madrid for tottenham. andr villas-boas leaves zenith for fiorentina only to declare interest for atltico madrid job a couple of days later...very realistic, not! argentine premier league rules are totally fictional, etc. si games seem to have totally lost its mojo with this game.",1.5
"i bought this game a little while after its release and have to say i had some issue initially....i think its very very different from earlier games and that was an initial turn off. but now iam abit more into it i think its wonderful,as addictive and fluid as ever, time to change my underwear as before :)",260.0
"just bought this game a few days ago. after installing, cannot launch the game. been trying updating all my drivers, uninstall and reinstall again and again. why this problem occur??????",107.7
"two main things really get me angry about the fm series. first off the match engine is not something to be expected for a anno 2014 game. without getting more detailed, it is obvious that si doesnt want this to be improved, as modern technology at tjis point really could offer something a hundred times better. wake up si, were not handheld here. ps: praise the lord that this sh*t is still better than eas fifa manager.... . the second most important thing for me is the pretty low amount of team licences offered by the game. this really bugs me because, even if you play a manager game for the management style, you still have that favorite team, it really bugs me how si doesnt have team licences for first division teams across europe....",150.0
"very good game tbh but, such a complex tactics.. still using other tactics than my own heheh",156.4
