"miasanmia, lads! good game overall, its better than 2014 imo.",383.9
"decent sports sim game, does have the drawbacks of quiet a steep price for what youre getting due to a certian amount of repetitivness. all in all a fun game though and if youre into football and want something different to fifa 15 a decent buy.",39.0
"another great edition of the most complete management game for both on the pitch tactics and off the pitch man management. steam workshop just makes this so much better. buy. play. love.",50.2
"i bought this game expecting to be hired by a real football club however im still waiting this is slower than amazon",62.5
"rubbish cant even upload the game and get started!!!",0.3
"i thought it would be a good idea to spend a fair amount of money on this game.... how wrong was i. its just boring to play and sh*t, i thought playing with my friends would make it a bit more fun..... yet again how wrong was i, having to wait all the fu*king time just for some c*nt to press continue. the gameplay is w*nk, poor graphics and not even real names of the clubs are used. if you want to buy this game as something fun to play then dont its sh*t.",28.9
"graphics and interface are great, the challenges and the new features are nice too, but the match engine is still awful. please sports interactive fix that match engine with dumb and bizarre plays. i play fm since the first ones and the match engine and a.i. always sucked, it seems that the newer versions keep the same horrible match engine. anyway, i still recommend the game if you are a football addict.",99.5
"very disappointed with this years game. lots of screens have been changed and they are now harder to navigate and make the changes you need that before - seems like a bad change to me. a few of my grievances: the squad selection screen, you now cant left click on a substitute to chose who to swap them with you cant create custom views for the opposition instructions screen - why?!? who thought that was a good idea? im also not really a fan of the new match engine but i cant put my finger on what i dont like. is it too bright, choppy (even with graphics levels set low). *sigh* on the whole, i wish i hadnt bought it.",859.7
"great game. veteran player of football manager series and i feel this game lives up to the football manager reputation. i got it at christmas time so missed reported bugs that now mainly seem to be fixed. as ever match engine can be tweaked to make it better but overall football manager 2015 will provide many hours of fun.",111.0
"bought this game after the december update and regarding the problems many other customers have complained about below i have to say after four full months of the first season i havnt had any problems with crazy amounts of injuries and the match engine is not producing crazy results. its not a perfect game, i think if the developers spent more time and effort on it then the game could be what it should be in the year 2015 after the 23 years of product development time theyve had since i first played cm on my amiga 500 back in the day, not to get to long winded - in my opinion its the best version ive played yet but it should have been this good in 2001. pros - steam workshop, fast gaming experience relative to previous versions, lots of options, not neccessarily overly complicated, match engine is capable of the beautiful game at times and does manage to elicit strong emotions in me, did i mention steam workshop? cons - gks sometimes go mindless for a few seconds in match engine leading to fantasy breaking silly goals this happens maybe once every three games, -having to always watch the kick offs and final whistle highlights in match engine even if nothing interesting happens, -about once a game in the match engine a pointless highlight will show and last too long even though nothing interesting is happening.",41.5
"hi, pro : all the stuff that was shown by developers previous was done: interface, coach experiance, etc... negative : there are 2 thing that i consider really bad, game results and percentage of shoots on goal, i am wining and loosing games tennis stile, i am wining with 7-0 but also loosing with 7-4... for this, i wouldnt recommend still fm2015 because, beside the updated database, the game is still not a decent evolution form fm2014.",273.9
"awesome game. still has some minor bugs but it can definately make you spend a lot of hours on it",294.0
"me likes. nice tweaks and updates from previous titles, nothing groundbreaking perhaps but solid update and in my opinion worth the yearly upgrade.",55.4
"sports interactive have really made a mess of this game. if you dont want to have a stroke because burnley are playing like real madrid and your keeper parries the ball to opposition feet then avoid buying it. far too many injuries leaving you to play with your worst players, tactics you set seem to be ignored. players are too easily offended. if ......and its a big if you get things going your way youll soon be slapped back down again by overall poor performances or injuries. awful. players also moan too much about game time which puts everyone on their period and you have to walk on egg shells. my god if i could swear on this i would. i have an alienware pc and with fm14 i could set the graphics to highest settings and it would play smoothly all day long, this pc eats up the system requirements and asks for seconds but on fm15 (exactly the same requirements) i have to leave it on medium otherwise the match engine struggles! ive loved all the fms and it rarely disappoints but fm15 has really let me down. angry with it in fact. extremely disappointed with it. ill return to fm14 to allow my blood to come off the boil and simmer",376.0
"i started a season with man utd and i have constantly been picking up injuries. ive not once had anywhere near a full strength team and falcao even got injured for 6 months. it seems im picking up two injuries a game. other than that the game is very good. the scouting in particular has been greatly improved. on previous versions of fm it almost seemed too easy to find amazing players and judge who was going to be the next big thing. now a lot less players appear when searching for transfers, meaning youll have to send your scouts out to other leagues and teams to gather information. theyve also added the option to scout an individual player for serveral months with more indepth scouting reports. if youre already big into fm and have played previous versions i think its a big enough update from 14 to be worth purchasing and for those whove never played it, the way that si have arranged their tabs and generally neatened up and simplified the layout of the game makes fm 15 the most accesible for a while.",122.9
"still not realistic considering what you see on the pitch. but still, the best manager game there is by far.",221.2
"much better than recent fm offerings! fm 2015 is the best yet!",167.4
"i love the football manager series but once again this years has bugs which have ruined it for me. conceding crazy goals, lots of goals via crosses aand defending set pieces is a joke. i wouldnt bother.",349.1
"even better than 2014 one. the management style, interface, player search and scouting; these and many other changes makes it awesome.",659.9
"warning: do not buy this game. ive been a loyal fan of fm for almost a decade now. this is by far the worst fm ever produced. loading the menu screen is slow, network games have become intollerable because of the lag, and the injuries have become so frequent that it borders on the absurd. they had one job to do all year since the last fm, which was to update the squads and update the scouting stats. now im angry at valve for having a no refund policy.",38.7
"do: play this game if you like bashing your head against your keyboard whenever your defense plays a horrible backpass and the other team scores dont: play this game if you want to have a social life",177.5
"great game, would recommend it. very addictive, (already played 500+ hours on it)",563.6
"great fm game has some issues which get sorted out soon anyway but its fun as hell",70.8
"much better than last years version. im not a massive fan of the interface though, some menus arent easily accessible enough for new users, all in all, a quality game though.",87.5
"the best way to ruin your life. with newest feature: the daily injuries one of my players got fractured ribs after receiving a lob pass from teammate. physio manager 2015 9.5 / 10",521.3
"player asked to leave because he wasnt getting first team football. complained when i transfer listed him. 10/10",171.3
"awesome game, love it! just wish there was more variety in the workshop. the game needs alot of things, like the kits, logos, etc. but still an amazing game to play alone or with friends.",94.0
"love football manager since the cm series. too bad i can not use my steam wallet for in game purchase this time. keep give me error code 1",96.8
"sensationally good game, following in the footsteps of its predecessors. the genius of its improvements are in the constant simplification of its features which makes it equally accessible to either hardcore football fans, casual gamers or indeed both.",247.7
"excellent game i have far too much time playing this it is just that addicting",167.2
"do we even need a goalkeeper in our team? it seems that we dont. because it doesnt make much difference if we had one in our team - we will still concede silly goals anyway. the match engine is rubbish. the worse fm i have ever played.",252.3
"hooked already. great game, and love most of the changes.",442.1
"how can i reccommend this game when i cannot find the editors anywhere on this site?",17.8
"this game is just amazing ! if you fan of football then buy this. you will like this : )",148.7
"this is my first fm i have got on pc, i have previously had it on hand held. i find the game fun but it can be rather unrealistic. i play a game and there might be 7-8 goals in a game its ridiculous. i find it very fustrating. i also find that signing players is to hard, this could be that i am just new to fm and just not very good but all the clubs seem to want 4 times the players value. hope there will be an update soon.",212.3
"i have had football manager since 2010, enjoyed playing iit greatly for years. i enjoyed the ability to micromanage the little things in the game mainly the sliders. if my team was getting scored on a great deal move thedefensive line slider back a few notches of which i had twenty. a few years ago they decided to do away with the sliders but keep them optional to simplify the game. fine i still have them... the last few years completly gone, and its obvious to anyone who plays the game that the system is exactly the same, the player and team instructions are still moving sliders in the background. so i am at the point where i am just not interested in the game anymore, i am sure there are people out there that like to tinker and micromanage their games, people that enjoy games like europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2. football manager has been one of my favorite games i hope they can listen to their fans and bring back what we all loved about the game.",42.7
"in every game 1-3 player gets injured. this game kicks your nut sacks as long till you want to play a totally different game. long winning streaks followed by long losing streaks. even the league bottom dwellers hits you with 6-0. too many goals (4-5 on average). horrible execution tackles inside penalty areas almost never leads to a penalty shot. but penalties come from errors which you cannot even see. fm15beta is faulty as hell. good job si! ok, this is beta, but it has to be a totally different game on next friday, when the official release date is. best goal : my goalie was called by referee. goalie walked there and received an yellow card. then my goalie started jogging towards his work place and meanwhile the opponent gave their corner kick and scored an empty netter. rather play fm13. beyond earth and this pre-purchased and regret both. never again a pre-purchase. not. even. one.",460.3
"horrible new layout. take a lot of time to get use to the new keys, buttons. might as well switch back to play 2014.............................................",3.2
"i quite like this games and i play it lots although im quite bad but my excuse is that i do it or the banter.",92.4
"overall, this year was a disappointment for me. first, i dont like the dark skin. but well, its just my taste. -injuries. everyone mentions about it. i think its not just the number of players injured which is the problem. the problem is the duration of those injuries. while playing with corinthians at some point i had 7 players out for 5-6 months with broken legs. all happened during matches. and i play this game at a good level for 6 years i know how to reduce them. it is just broken. -players are just . just 3 weeks after some jackass signs a new contract, he becomes unhappy with his contract and asking for a new one. if a player is playing well, he becomes unhappy in any case, he wants more salary, a new challenge or is flattered by interest of a bigger club. player is on international duty for 40 days and he becomes unhappy for not being in the first team. same goes with injured players. -i have a squad of 24 players. 21 of them are on international duty and i have a semi final match. game is simply absurdly ed up. you cant make any alterations on your fixture, you cant interact with the fa or your club board for most cases. after all, i could write down a 50-page list on things that are  in the game. i wont. i just want to tell everyone who considers buying the game: i feel like they intentionally made it so  so that we will be forced to buy the ingame editor. there is no way you can play this game unless you buy the ingame editor. keep it in mind.",183.5
"absolutely love this game, andforthose tothose who want realism from a simulation game, get a grip people, first and foremost its a game....it aint supposed to imitate the real thing to perfection!",591.8
"nice game, nice interface, pretty accurate database. i always thought that it was a scissors, paper, rock game and i should just fine the thing to win all games but its not. the thing you do on the bench really affects the players on the field. the 3d is indeed pretty bad but for me it doesnt matter because i use 2d. if i wanted a graphical football game i would have chosen fifa instead. the initial version was full of bugs but now, with the latest updates, it feels good.",212.7
"this is football manager and thats it... by reading this quote you should know this game is amazing. if you love football and you are looking for a real life football simulator this is the game for you... super realistic the players play like they do in real life. get ready for adiction",46.8
"played fm14 before, and will gladly stick to 14. longshots and headers dominate in this edition, with possession-based tactics falling by the wearside to be replaced by route-one and direct stuff. the match engine is ridiculously inaccurate, and keepers are as good as an u12 sunday league keeper. wish i never spent full retail price on fm15, hopefully patches balance it out",468.9
"i see all these negative reviews about fm 2015. and i strongly disagree with most of them. first of all yeah there are a decent amount of injuries during a season. i played quite a few seasons and after looking the average amount of injuries that occure both ingame and in real. i must say it has been made quite realistic. the amount of injuries i got a season appear to be just below the average in real. so i must say this is quite good. the amount of own goals has been a big complaint aswell but compare it with the amount the average top team of each league gets it is just a bit more than in real. that is mainly because in real they dont count everything a own goal that has been last touched by a defending player while fm 2015 does. i could go on for a while with ruining peoples their complaints but in general this version of fm is better than all of the previous ones. the menu is amazing now and the possibilities are endless.",287.7
"really enjoying the game right now, i like starting with a lower league team and rising them up to the top league. im currently playing as stoke after being offered a job there because i promoted york city to the championship! loads of possibilities, my only issue is that there should be some fmc features in the normal fm mode apart from that good game.",38.4
"agree about the injuries, after two games i have half of my squad injured for at least 3/4 weeks, it needs sorting asap, and as for the layout, it can be confussing at first but once you get used to it, it works well.",341.7
"never had a problem with years of fm from 2008 but fm 2015 will not work on my computer the sinc and graphics are not watchable and you cant keep track of ball or goals",438.3
"calling football manager the best management sim out there is always a redundant statement. true as it is, its peerless excellence has chased any significant rivals away. but the biggest task is tempting players away from their carefully built career in the previous game. sports interactive know that its games biggest competition remains itself and, as you may tell your team at halftime, they must guard against complacency. fm15s changes tend to contribute to gentle improvement rather than startling disruption, but should do enough to tempt you into starting that managerial journey all over again.",56.6
"having played every version of football manager back to the heydays of championship manager on the amiga, purchasing every year without regret as i always get my moneys worth. they changed the layout for the better this year and did the usual tweaks and as ever it has took a few patches but the game plays as well as ever. highlight for me has been the scouting tweak, made me think how best to get the info i need on players and as in real life the best way is to watch them and also have they come in on trial. its a small thing but that is what makes football manager worthy of purchase each year, all the small thngs that make one great thing. off to don the sheepskin and see what dreams can be acheived.",237.3
"fantastic game,so addictive.managed to win championship title with norwich city,now doing ok in the premiership.wish neil adams could manage norwich as well as i have.think its time for me to take over as manager of norwich in real life.",103.4
"good game, plays well. there arent too many injuries as some have suggested, nor is it too difficult. with a well devised tactic and a solid training plan, success is very possible. having said that, there is now a bug that prevents the loading of the game at all. steam yet again is proving to be an utter abortion of an application. why on earth im compelled to use this third party trash to load my game is completely beyond me.",329.1
"it has beautiful match engiene, some glitches but overall its fun to play. the scorelines do seem to be unrealistic at times but i love how everything has unfolded beautifully in 2015. you have that thrill playing against the rivals and getting new big name player. id love it to be bit harder and have some more tactical and traning settings.",11.1
"shocking ! the game always fails to load ! either steam or football manager need to fix the problem !",9.6
"i see a lot of negative reviews here, some even from experienced fm players. to be honest, really experienced players dont (seriously) play fm until final patch - that one with winter transfer updates, which also (usually) fixes all unwanted stuff like injuries, corners, woodwork, one-on-ones and other weird things devs did to ruin gameplay (they do it every year btw, youll see the pattern if you continue to play fm  its almost a tradition). just remember that football manager until the final patch is a public beta and youll be ok. as for the game itself, i played one season so far and enjoyed it. there were too much injuries, but it can be considered as a challenge (also rotation and young players were extremelly happy to replace crippled first team members). there were too much woodwork (but several fms back it was much worse). there were some nice goals and dramatic matches. overall, it was typical football manager experience  not ideal, but quite enjoyable. match engine improved a lot  much less scripted goals, much more goal diversity (my player even won goal of the month award  thing i cant remember since introducing 3d match engine). still, we have a lot of morale goals during 46-48 min period, but i guess itll never change. anyway, you can have some fun with fm15 or die from a rage attack. your choice. tl;dr: try it, but starting long-term careers until patch 15.3 is out is unadvisable.",120.4
"vert good football manager simulation, but a game that costs 50 cannot have this column disappearing bug that makes the game unplayable. now i cannot see my roster. totally unacceptable.",25.5
"a few hours into the gameplay and 3/4ths of my team are out for 6 or more weeks... dont know if this a bug or not or just realistic that half of united are injured.",64.8
"so frustating. i dont know whats wrong. i feel like i lost my ability to play this game. i am noob all over again. (been playing since 2001). - my team keep shooting didnt score. the enemy 1 bullet to the heart! and of course i lost the game. - my wing back keep dribbling until byline wont cross, and if he do the crosses hit enemy foot and goes corner kick. frustating. - my goalie is dumb, enemies goalie is all neuer! unbeatable. i need. or we all need major fixes. please. :(",112.9
"i was really disappointed with the previous football manager (2014) so i couldnt bring myself to pay out of my own wallet for it this year. i got this as a gift for christmas and thought you know what, lets give sports interactive another chance. i started as unemployed and took the morcambe job in the middle of the season, i spent the best part of an hour and a half setting up training, bringing in coaches, creating a good tactic and getting to know my squad. within 20 minutes of my first match my keeper catches a lazy effort from 30 yards out, only to turn around stroll back into his own net with the ball clutched in hands. quit game, uninstall.",9.3
"this sums the game up in my opinion.. last two games rangers 4-4 dumbarton 9 yellow cards, 6 red cards - 3 each!!, all but 1 of the 8 goals were own goals. rangers 4 - 2 motherwell 3 red cards, 1 own goal riddled with bugs, need major improvement",523.7
"the game definitely has some issues but it is still your bog standard footy manager and i am enjoying it",28.9
"currently slightly buggy/crashy but it is still in beta and have upmost faith it will work perfectly within a couple of patches. once again, a great game with extra features, a definite upgrade from fm 14.",104.2
"i didnt like the game at all i cant even play it the colors of the background really hurt my eyes i cant look more than 10 mins. i played football manager 13 before and that was much better than this. background is fully black and all the other lively colors make it hard to read. and you cant personalize this. you cant see the additional packs bought in the game. i am really frustrated. i cant see the full pitch while playing in 2d mode. i can not search for players after 2 transfers. what is wrong this year?",154.4
"this game has single handedly ruined my life. i love it!!",74.0
"this game has its ups and downs, leading me to an inconclusive decision whether it is the best yet. to me, the match engine is unrealistic, the goalkeepers (dont get me started on the gks) seem to save the first and then be nowhere for the rebound. ive resorted to the classic 2d match engine so i dont have to painfully see these mistakes being made. if you want a prospect youre going to need the capital, as many enquiries i get come back with 57m which no one is going to pay for a 16 year old. although this being said it does make it more realistic in that aspect. overall its an improvement, and linked together with the steam workshop it gives players a chance to post their tactic of dominance in which other players can then implement into their game. all the issues ive stated can be patched up.",335.9
"one of the best football management sims out there. actually challenging to get a team to work properly together, a proper simulation game. also i love it how si still improve the game, how they listen to peoples complaints about bugs on their forums and actively seek to improve their game. not all companies would fully support their games for a whole year.",546.0
"im a addict have been for years and it just keeps getting better and better",775.1
"not really an improvement from 14 and there are 2 major gameplay issues i have singled out: -free kicks it is highly unlikely that you will have a normal direct freekick/goal ratio in a team without a top (yaya toure, ronaldo etc) fk taker. -disallowed goals it is irritatingly common to score >1 disallowed goals in a game.",14.8
"ive played most the football managers over the years and to be fair, this is a big step up from fm14 which was awful, i have actually got into this fm and enjoyed every minute of it. i like the new press and scouting features and can see a difference with the game engine, even if its small. for everybody saying its awful, just remeber its still a new release, and comparing with last year its pretty descent. i havent had the trouble of to many goals from crosses. to me, this game is enjoyable and fun.",140.1
"love this game so far. engine may be a little bit buggy at the moment but i expect them to fix that. definitely recommend picking it up.",147.3
"great game i played so far the new design is refreshing giving a new hole experience on this amazing saga of conquests!",56.7
"the game has many improvements but untill they sort out the news feed which literally hurt my eyes and stopped me from contiuning due to not being able to read i cannot reccomend this game any more. sorry but the new design looks like its been designed by kids!",178.7
"this game contains a lot of detail. compared to other football games such as fifa and pes, this is surperior in team managment, transfer negotiations and it also contains meetings and press confrences (which you can skip if you`re not to fond of that sort of stuff). this game i great mate, 8/8",235.4
"this i my first time buying and playing a fm game. i usually play fifa on ps4. however this is a breathe of fresh air! love the layout and how you actually have to think unlike fifa or pes. co-op is awesome and great with friends! would definetly recommend and i will be buying future ones for sure! wonderful game.",88.3
"excellent game if you like football. easy to get into... very difficult to master. be warned..... free time is now a thing of the past and days playing this game will roll over into each other and before you know it, the next one is out!",128.8
"ive put the beta version on my laptop but now ive purchased the actual game on disc but after i install the game ,it still says this is the beta version on the bottom left of screen , so does this mean my disc hasnt installed or how do i play the disc version",572.9
"what happened?? i played the beta-version, but i have some major issues with it. for instance everybody gets fired.. van gaal, guardiola, klopp, mazarri, inzaghi, ancelotti, rutten(feyenoord).. the press conferences are wieird, the interface is (imo) terrible.. if this beta is anything like the endproduct i am going to stay with fm 14",288.1
"a good game but has a few issues (e.g. clean sheets). takes a bit of time to get used to the new layout. overall a worthwhile buy but if you have football manager 2014 it may be worthwhile to wait until football manager 2016 is released.",317.5
"at the moment, its not enjoyable and borderline unplayable heavily down to the awful match engine. might come back when they decide to publish a finished game, until then ill stick to fm 2010, much better game!",53.6
"i would 100% recormend this game to anyone that likes gamemodes like career mode on fifa 15 but football manager goes into fare more depth and more teams and player even though the graphic arnt great the game makes it back with many fetures that they offer. this year it is made easyer to navigate the menu. the best new feature is when setting up a new carear you change your past history from a no body to a ex-world class player.",259.2
"what can i say? the game is awesome way more tricky and challenging than the last few years. if you enjoy football then grab this game.",206.1
"it is a great game to play and the menus look better it is worth the money",19.3
"so far i loved the game, really good and fair enough to play it this year. graphics really good, teams nice, players awesome and perfect training system in my opinion! just the best fm till now! awesome guys, really deserved the 50. my review is 9/10.",102.8
"this is the best fm ive ever played. some wonderkids really can make a difference despite of their young age. the game machine is getting better.",188.9
"dont understand why i have to login in to steam servers to play a game i have bought and played numerous times already. so frustrating to not be able to play my game because your servers cannot cope!!!!!",228.3
"time for yet another fm, and instead of the usual praise to the sky; i find myself struggling for words. i played as fc copenhagen, within a month i had 8(!) first/key team members out with injuries - and not just the common cold, mind you - no, oh no. one with a broken ankel, two with damaged tendrons, a broken foot etc. the shortest injury was 3(!!!!) months - i feel like im running a community hospital rather than a football club. anyways, we recover and start winning some matches - except... we dont. for some odd reason it seems like you can dominate a match, to the point where even the opponents fans are rooting for you, and yet they still pull a comeback at the end. draws galore. 1 shot, 1 kill, so to speak. but heck, lets review some of the positives as well... great, realistic scouting system. good layout. aaaaand. yup. id recommend you wait purchasing this game until another update has come out. do it for you own sake, and for ours - the unfortunate souls that purchased this game in good faith that it would be the high standard the game usually is. let them feel the heat, so they can fix this asap.",513.0
"i dont understand why so many negative reviews i havent found anything bad this is my first ever time playing any football manager and i found it farely easy to understand the only problem is when they take corners theyt stand there for about 5-10 seconds but then they go back to normal but then its fine for ages. great game",57.7
"fm used to be a great football manager, now it has become a great kindergarden manager, if that is what you are looking for. trying to keep footballers happy will either drive you insane or push you towards the ultra-vanilla classic mode. i wouldnt mind a slightly less realistic game if it was slightly more enjoyable to play.",448.6
"man alive there is a lot of goals and injuries in this game. the match engine makes your players look like theyre skating on ice. most my games finish 5-3. 4-3 etc. if im down 2-0 at half im not all that worried cause theres a chance i might score 4 goals in the 2nd half. i hope they fix some of these issues in the january update.",51.6
"excellent as per, there are small bugs to fix and changes to be made but there always are at this stage of release. i always find the finished article is when they release the large update after the january transfer window. regardless, definitely worth a purchase.",787.5
"apparently someone who makes the match engine died because the whole ing thing is a disaster. the most realistic football simulation game offers realistic scorelines such as 7-3, 6-2, and ive even seen an 8-8 draw. defending is non existent. goalkeepers take about 10 minuites to get up after they make a save and the whole thing is just broken. i lost 5-0 when my team had 15 shots 6 on target and they had around 5 shots 3 on target. 2 of them were own goals and the rest were rebounds from the keeper. if you call that realistic i have no idea what league you are looking at. i hate when people say its your tactics; ive tried every tactic possible just to get some results and nothing works. i started about 3 saves now. i like the new layout and the game mechanics. but the match engine is godawful and unfinished to the point where i question if its a football game. why the  is the match engine so bad when it was amazing on fm14? go back to 14 everybody where you can get realistic scorelines. tl;dr , nobody can score, nobody can defend, goalkeepers are apparently disabled. dont buy it until a patch comes out.",386.4
"football manager   .    .     .   ,    ,   .  ,   ,   .       .           ,   . thanks, fm!",74.6

"pretty good so far. i have been a devotee since fm 2010 and buy this every year. i never really got into fm 2014 but so far i am liking fm 2015. the high score line games is a bit of a bug but it is being worked on so i dont doubt soon enough games will revert to more sensible score lines. the new interface is really good and very easy to navigate and the overall appearance of the game is attractive. at this point it still is a little buggy but i would think in due course it will be sorted out and will be a solid addition to the fm line up.",71.7
"two main things really get me angry about the fm series. first off the match engine is not something to be expected for a anno 2014 game. without getting more detailed, it is obvious that si doesnt want this to be improved, as modern technology at tjis point really could offer something a hundred times better. wake up si, were not handheld here. ps: praise the lord that this sh*t is still better than eas fifa manager.... . the second most important thing for me is the pretty low amount of team licences offered by the game. this really bugs me because, even if you play a manager game for the management style, you still have that favorite team, it really bugs me how si doesnt have team licences for first division teams across europe....",150.0
"i am a long term fan of this game franchise since the good old champ man 2 days, however in recent years ive really struggled with releases - lots of broken features, and a general feeling of new releases being more of an update than a new version. i didnt have high hopes for this year... im happy to report that ive been proven wrong. the new ui is great, with the google style search bar, and easy to navigate to important information on the menu bar on the left. the whole tracksuit / tactical manager profile option is a great feature, and at lower league clubs, youre able to directly involve yourself in the development of players without needing to hire in un-obtainable coaches, but it doesnt feel like a cheat as you need to surround yourself with motivators, tacticians and probably a director of football. im not sure on some of the new staff role - not really sure what a head physio does over and above a normal physio, but the chief scout is great in removing the micro-management of setting scouting assignments, but it would be useful to be able to override his assignments if you need to. match engine looks good, but still seems to have some bugs - im sure my strikers arent offside half the time its called, and often find muyself screaming never or 1-0 to the referee at my screen, but thats no diferent from when im in the stands on a saturday :) overall, this is a good version of the game, and has re-invigorated my love following a couple of years in the wilderness.",315.2

"good game, but you cant really compare it to other football games like fifa and pes. this is a very tactical game, and you can easely get fired, but overall a very good football game, ratings: graphics - 6/10 - nice interface and layout, but when you play a match, it isnt as good to look at. gameplay - 8/10 - tactical and very good! mods - 8/10 - nice amount mods and tweaks to this game, and they are working absolutley fine. overall - 6.7/10 (let me know to other things to judge) (i know of the youtubers footymanagertv and statapp, comment more people!)",13.2

"the best version yet, many great new additions. the tactical side is more realistic and you need to make sure you get everything done properly from fitness, especially in pre-season to training and motiation to tactics or youll struggle to win. i have completed my first season and did the double. the best new addition though is australias ffa cup.",35.7
"honestly, ive been purchasing this game for 9 years now and honestly i dont understand why players are never fit. several of my players even the non-injury prone players seem to repeatedly die on the pitch. united seem to be able to be in the relegation and still win champions league i mean honestly utter crap too many offside goals and star ratings arent realistic",671.9

"playing fm since 2000/2001. the series is my favourite of all time across all genres. the last 3 years however the game has been getting gradually more of an exercise in ambigious tedium than the magical gaming experience it used to be. i appreciate the people at si need to change the game to justify the price tag, i just dont know why they insist on breaking the game to do so. i can only hope the truly awful new features (im looking at you tactics screen) will be patched. they wont though, way too much pride. god what ive give for the return of slide bars. id also love some explanation, no matter how vague, for how the 10 million different variables that can affect the outcome of a match actually work. im certain si changed the way things like tempo work in game for different tactics without mentioning it or eve updating the tips bar. poor form. moreover, having touchline shouts, pressers, player interaction, 3 teamtalks its too much, and its for the most part very very boring. as for the me just like with fm14 and 13 at release, its broken. you would think after 2 poor mes at release si would have the integrity and self respect to deliver this year... i remember when si used to release games that didnt need a single patch. i think the monopoly si have over the genre has made them complacent, its only natural i suppose. do not purchase until they have fixed the game. maybe in mid march 2 months before the season ends :d",299.5
"waste of my time and money. i should have known after a mediocre fm 14 this wasnt gonnabe an improvement. i loved these games once, all the way back to the very first cm ever. the last one i enjoyed must have been fm 11 or earlier. the more new game additions, the more bugs and crashes, match engine sucks, 3d is awful ( never seen a player skip sideways on a pitch before). its ok to add 3d, but do it right or not at all. i dont think ill buy another fm for a while. cant enjoy this, i think i have champman 04/05 on an old pc. ill play that, 10 year old game is much better than this terrible bugfest.",105.1

"still the best football simulator game.. after i missed the 2014 series, this 2015 series is a much improvement from 2013 series.. the most improved part is: (1) higher complexity in handling players contracts and negotiation with other clubs; as well as (2) the improved tactical variety (players role, etc). while this could be a little bit cumbersome for those who new to this series, i believe the built-in tutorial will be very useful.",99.9

"only negative i can say is in my 3rd season with man utd i hit some sort of glitch that meant i couldnt win away from home! seriously, my home record was; played 19 won 18 drew 1... away record; played 19, won 3, drew, 6, lost 10. i had scores like loosing 2-1 to brentford (whom had been promoted) leading arsenal 4-1 with 10 mins to go, to drawing 4-4. beat city at old trafford 5-0 and lost at the etihad 5-3. the scores throughout that season just seemed very random, no matter what i did. other than that its very much same old fm (which there is nothing wrong with) already played 71 hours. trying to catch up on the 600+ hours i played of the last edition haha",194.1

"i wouldnt recommend buying this game until a few patches are released. the release version is full of bugs, especially the match engine, that makes it almost unplayable. i mean, sure, you can play it, but you just have to cringe at all the goals scored from obvious match engine bugs. at this point, 50% of goals are scored from crosses on the wing that your defenders just dont contest, 30% scored from set pieces, 10% scored on missplaced backpasses to the keeper and 10% for the rest. the defense and goalie are so terrible most matches end with 4+ goals scored. if you want to win, just make sure you have wingers who like to hug the touchline and cross the ball instead of cutting inside should have expected it really, it is the first time i buy fm right on the release date.",251.6

"having played many fm games over the years, i didnt think that the match end could become more painful to watch. seeing your own players move out of the way of the ball has been in the game for ages and its really time this kind of nonsense was fixed. watching a match is like pulling teeth, as your players walk to tackle, move out of their way and let the opposition clean through on goal. had this not cost 17, i would never have bought it because no fm game is worth 30. the game has become so bloated that it has forgotten its core values of what made fm such a great.",35.1

"this game is nowhere near as good as previous seasons. they have screwed up on some of the most basic things like for example there are no arrows to scroll down lists, you cant switch between manager profiles properly anymore and things that were easily accessible before im struggling to find now. i am also having all the same problems as other people like 3 injured players in 1 pre-season friendly (joke) and after that 1 friendly my game crashed and now wont re-load. i have also bought every football manager since its split from champ man and this is easily the worst. i sell games for a living and have always championed fm but from what i have seen so far i am extremely disappointed and wont be advising others ton get it.",47.4

"this game is really atrociously bad. tactics are stupid, the players are stupid and what can you say about the match-engine.... is just action after reaction after reaction - ask your team to tackle a player hard - get sent off after 2 min - go 2 up - get 2 pegged back - then score 3- 2 - or go 2 down - peg 2 back - then lose 3-2 - teamtalk, press conferences - whats the point of it all... seriously - i want my money back - the last good fm was also the first one - 2005... 10 years of garbage and its just keeps getting worse by every year - i will never buy fm again.",9.9
"same game as the last couple of years. its a little better with the newest patch but a lot of things still dont matter. - the teamspeeches dont seem to do anything or you get negative results from it even though the game says you should say that to them. - clubs controlled by the game buy up all of the best players and then dont even let them play, making it very diffecult for you to create a team that can win big prices. the players how go to those clubs and the after a year are put on the transferlist dont want to move to your club because they are playing at a better club even though they didnt play a single match. - scouting uses a system where you can see what percentage your knowledge of a player (0-100%) is but there is no option in the scoutingmenu to say scout to a 100%. and even then at 100% sometimes the players potential still isnt completly scouted. - when asking the board to raise the salarycap for staff members it gets raised by 200 euros which isnt nearly enough to get any improvements. - whenever one of your players get injured during a match its never the games fault. it never gives itself a red or even a yellow card. but you get red cards constantly. - still cant reload my save during matches. its an offline single-player game. if i want to reload my save during a match who cares. these are the main problems. and yet its still very addictive, the best football management game out there and i cant stop playing.",499.1

"i had this sitting on my wishlist for more than a month before i decided to risk everything and buy it. i was hoping to get it on sale but i got so bored with my other games i couldnt wait any longer. being a long time player of the ea fifa manager series (now discontinued) and a one time player of fm years ago, and read all the recent bad reviews i thought i was going in with my eyes open. i knew what i wanted in a football manager game and this one just didnt deliver - particularly on the matchday experience. everything was cool to begin with, having to go for job interviews to get a manager gig, etc. i thought that was unique. the whole build up to match day was good, choosing tactics, and formations, etc. its all very very detailed. i was quite happy to tinker for hours before i decided to plough through to a friendly match. then i was presented with the most god-awful ui for match day, and a 1980s 3d rendition of a football match which i eventually turned it 2d mode because i couldnt stand it. for a game that has been around for how long, this 3d match engine is appalling. they would be much better off just having a text ticker for gameplay rather than a half-a55ed attempt at a 3d game engine. i hated the interface for actual match play. way too much clutter, nothing intuitive. you could only have 1 or 2 widgets up and running at a time. it really hasnt been thought out well. i wish i could take the ui and match engine from fifa manager and plug it into this - it would be much more appealing to me. *sigh* another wasted $50. they do refunds around here? update: ironically within hours of this review it went on sale in steam *aaaaaaarghhhhh*",6.4

"liking it, changes to the game are subtle and things i cant be bothered with like press and training are far too repetitive but in saying that it has it good points, the over feel of the game is good, with the new ui they have made a lot of improvments. a word to the developers, think big, rather than loads of small improvments you guys need to go for a big leap, try and give us regular customers something to get excited about, stadium design or being able to create a club from scratch in the lower leagues of a country and make it a real force over 10 seasons+. but all in all, if your a fan of the series then youll be happy with this...",260.8

"there is certainly a lot more going on in this years iteration of fm - certain elements have been changed massively from the fm14 look, whilst some have received only a mild tweaking. this tends to be the case nearly every year and dont always result in an improved product the changes made this year have largely been pleasing, although in particular i am not a fan of the new tactics board. it seems like the information i need is still there but it is hidden behind extra menus and mouse clicks, generally creating what feels to me like an inefficient system when compared to fm14. the gameplay has remained largely the same and is familiar to anyone who has spent time with the series. the engine seems to have been improved in some areas and regressed in others, again mirroring previous versions of the game. there seem to be more goals going in, more goals from crosses and set pieces, and more defensive errors. the game also seems harder and learns an inflexible managers tactics rather quickly. i only use the 2d classic view so cant comment on the 3d match engine, i have never used it or had any interest in it. fundamentally, its still great fun to build and develop a team, to argue with other managers and to lead your club to glory or glourious defeat. i would definitely recommend this to anyone with more than a passing interest in the franchise and it represents a solid return on investment in terms of new features and gameplay hours.",253.5
"ive played until the end of the january transfer windows in my first season in the premiership. basically, my opinion is that the game has no realism as previous fms have been. the game is competely full of injuries, penalties and high scoring games that would simply no happen in real life. having read reviews of other gamers of fm15, it would appear that im not alone on this. a update is badly needed for this!! as for the 3d match engine, it looks like a cross between table top football and subbuteo.... fm has been using the 3d match engine for many years now, and it would appear that it has hardly been improved despite all the techology available these days. im afraid that the game is no longer enjoyable. i would recommend anyone sitting on the fence about buying it to avoid it. stick to fm14 until they sort this out.",42.8
"i have always been a fan of fm since the days of cm therefore i may sound biased. good: its another new version of the fm series that have grown from strength to where they are right now. the fact is that championship manager and fifa manager are no more in the market shows how strong the monopoly fm has on football management games. bad: the crash dumps are very frequent. so i have to resort to saving the game before every game. (i hope that my save game never get corrupted.) overall, this is akin to an addiction to crack cocaine. you will just keep buying it every time it comes out. the painful part is that how do you start all over again if you are very deep in your game. (im looking at you fm 16.)",752.6
"started with football manager 2013 just out of curiosity (one of the top played games on steam being a soccer management game, lolwut?) since then ive been hooked though, this series continues to be the best management simulation game ive ever experienced, and this year only gets better. match engine and tactics are far better than in 2014, from what ive experienced so far, and its a great game overall, like always.",31.9

"where do i begin. i have been trough it all lately. inevitable injuries to key players, constant leaking goalies, the ridiculous crossing goalies, 7-4 defeats to non-league teams that i should have stomped on and of course some disasterous defending by my players ai. but still i come back to it again and again. hitting my head against the same bloody brick wall day after another. and for some reason it has worked. i have had couple of saves which have gone fantastically so far. the ai still is kinda  but way better than at launch. new additions such the sidebar and more in-depth scoutin have taken a another small step towards realism and i feel like the abnoxious pre and after game journalist mlestations are easier to handle. so i am going to give it a recommendation for what it is, but please make the game properly and dont leave it all for beta testers to get trough i had one save on the beta and it was abnoxious and almost unplayable. it might have ruined the game for some players before it even came out.",780.4

"ive picked up fm 2015 after 5 years abstinence and im hooked again. match engine has improved since the release with each patch, but again there is still room for improvement. every new patch states that keeper reactions are fixed but i still fear every shot on goal and slow keeper reactions after the save. everyone is complaining about tactical incosistency, how you can beat real madrid and loose next match against a lower league team, but its good to change up your formation and tactics from time to time. for me at least it is something that i like and keeps me playing. ui is useful and easy to learn. overall game speed is ok, im usualy playing with 7-8 different nation leagues and didnt experience any lag. i have no complaints on training and youth development. i dont like high transfer values and money spent for weekly/monthly wages but then again thats how it works in reality. does it have that addiction spice in the whole mix? yes it does, at least for me it has :). ive been playing fm (old cm) since i was 13 years old and now im 35 :). is it worth 50 euros? no, it certainly is not. but then again i didnt have any problem spending that ammount of money, because i want to support developers for making one of my favourite games :).",451.7

"this game, in a word, is *addictive*. i find myself losing hours to this spreadsheet simulator, which to all my better judgement seems to be a random number generator which calculates football scores, completely detatched from the rest of the tactical, managerial business behind the scenes. and yet there is a chance that the tweaks you make to the team that lost 2-1 last time away to brentford, would transform the team into chelsea beaters and take you to the fa cup final and win glory for your beloved team. and that emotional empathy this game creates is as close to the real thing as watching a real football match on the tv. superb.",101.0
"really dont understand how the me gets worse. 2012 was ok, just needing a bit of tweaking. 2013 onwards have been shocking, with the latest being the worst. i fully understand that fm is a management simulator, and that si will say it isnt meant to be fifaesque in terms of graphics etc., but that isnt my gripe. the major issue i have with the me is what you see happening in no way relates to your instructions or the stats at the end. for example, you concede too many from balls over the top, so you set the team to defend deeper. but when you are viewing the match, the back four are still in the halfway line. what is the point in having the facility to change something if the me doesnt reflect that change? same with ratings; a keeper drops one into his own net then kicks a ball stright to the opposition to score. his rating is a 7. from what i see, he is at fault for two goals, yet if i discipline or drop him, he thinks its unwarranted as the stats say he played well. nothing you see happening relates to stats. some of the interplay is laughable. world class players look like baby deer trying to kick a ball and the decision making completely at odds with what players (especially good ones) would do in those situations. only real benefit of th game its updated database. aside from that its a poor imitation of previous versions. save your money",136.7

"ive played football manager since ever (1999). i appreciate the updates and all the effort to have the most realistic experience. this version (as well 2014) disappointed me. negative experience: - too many players became superstars. - injuries way too many, even with proper turnover, training infrastructure and trainers (killing the game esperience) especially when the player complain because didnt played 2 match since the injury. - we cannot manage the stadium. - headcoach (player) has always respect from the board, in fact they never changed idea. i.e. i trained a.s.roma for 10 years, winning 3 champions league, 3 world cup for clubs, 6 championship and 5 national cup (without counting european super cup 2 and 7 national supercups) in the real world a.s.roma is building the new stadium. in the game i asked 5 times and has been rejected, i even ultimatum them nothing...

"the sidebar is welcome. generally the screen layouts have been much improved. however the match engine feels like a bit of a backward step, although i understand that its early days for the motion-capture route their taking. the one thing that drives me mad the most is the sound of ball being kicked; a noise happens every time a player kicks the ball, even if its a mere tap a foot a head of them. this is most fustrating during intra-squad friendlies when there is no crowd noise to ease the pain.",119.5

"i love this game and have been playing it for around 12 years. although i do enjoy this version there is still alot wrong with it. the game day match engine is just not good enough and if it doesnt improve they should just revert back to the old days of watching circles run around the pitch. the stats for your manager at the beginning mean nothing as i won promotion with sheffield wednesday and the following season i was outside the relegation zone and looking like staying up (my objective was to fight against relegation) and they still sack me. additional to this i was making the team money. this has happened to me twice with two seperate teams. the stats i choose at the beginning were for a top manager and there is no way a team in that situation in real life would sack a top manager in that position. the top clubs sign all the best players but these players would not be happy to be sat on the bench and not playing games at all, just not realistic). and the amount of injuries i am faced against, at one point i had 8 of my first team players out for 2 months or more. like i said i do like the game though and will continue to play the gaem. i just hope our comments are heard and the game next year is better than ever and back to its origins at the top of the pile for its genre.",163.8

"ive played every single football manager game since the split from championship manager and every single championship manager before that and i have to say, this is the first time ive been massively disapointed in the series - it doesnt feel like fm, its a skewed imposter. some things around the game has improved in subtle ways - match day stadiums looks great, the scouting is more realistic than ever but the good ends there. the matchday engine has slowly become a joke over the years, tolerable but still worsening for the past 3 editions, this one being the worst. injuries are through the roof in this version (even after the hotfix tweaks) and its impossible to keep a players fitness up even with squad rotation. in addition to the injuries the goals are insane your team will score 100 goals a season with anichebe as your main attacking threat but youll also concede just as many with neuer as your keeper. tactics dont seem to matter all that much, after testing it seems the main factor is your familiarity with it. if its low youll drop easy wins without question as your defenders refuse to perform any type of tackle. in all i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone in its current state and i really hope si throw out some massive fixes/improvements and soon.",79.7

"core experience remains the same but an upgraded match engine and a few new features make this a worthwhile addition. much like its predecessor, fm2015 is an evolution of the series rather than a revolution. this is both a bad and a good thing. the main differences between 2014 are mainly numerous small things that i will not mention here. i will mention the two things that stand out to me however. 1.) match engine: this has been in my opinion, greatly improved. matches seem to flow better, there are far more moves, goals scored seem mutch more varied and over all it makes it harder to predict the outcome of a move (something i found i could do with previous match engines due to having seen the same move over and over again). overall i think this is the best 3d match engine they have released. 2.) layout: for some reason they have decided to completly change the layout and all the menus etc. this is still p*ssing me off as the changes seem illogical and now takes me much longer to go to screens than before. i can see no reason for the change apart from for changes sake. it doesnt make things easier or quicker or more intuitive and generally just slows things down as it can take awhile to dig into sub menu after sub menu to look for the page you want. for existing fm2014 fans this may not have enough of a change to warrant a full price purchase but for players of older versions or new players i think the updated match engine do warrant the game for consideration. overall i do recommend the game as overall i find the fm series to be excellent, however note there are not a massive amount of changes compared to the last release.",119.7

"it is a new game, with a new and very easy to use interface imo, together with the gameplay fm15 looks amazing on the outside. i know this is just a beta and i have only played a few hours on this game, i have encountered problems which i dont know whether i am terrible at managing arsenal or that the bugs are really messing me up. 1. lots and lots of own goals, it happened that calum chambers scored a hatrick of own goals against qpr which ultimately lost me the game. 2. injuries, injuries everywhere. at least all my players have been injured once since i have been in charge (4months) and it is getting ridiculous. debuchy was injured for 3 months then i played him once he got fit and got injured again for another 2. it is getting out of hand. 3. goalkeepers. where do i begin? goalkeepers do the craziest  in the entire world, sometimes it can be funny and other times its frustrating as fwuak. it is also not my own gk aswell when i check other games replay, the goalies can be proper (sorry). other than those issues this game has been great for me. i absolutely love the tactics menu, the new scouting system and more player interaction. even though this game does have its issues, it should not be discouraged to play it. i am sure these issues are being brought up by si and they are trying to fix it. personally even with its bugs, it is a better and more challenging game than fm14 7/10 peace <3 edit: si officialy released a patch fixing issues with the goalkeepers and the own goals <3 si",424.9
"for all the people on here complaining about goal bugs etc, they have almost all been fixed. this is clearly the best football manager yet, much more in depth, and yes there are a few flaws, but if youd care to name me one decent videogame without a few flaws id be much abliged to hear. if you are a fan of football management sims, get this game! its as simple as that ;-)",531.2

"im managers fan since world soccer on atari 65xe and i have solid history with all cm/fm series releases. with all that i can assure you this version of fm is another milestone ( somehow like fm 2008 was ). at the start of beta/early access the game was a bit buggy and match engine needed a lot of tweeks but yet another time si and their team step up to the challenge and actualy listen to the community. in last 14 days they hotfixed most of the issues and game is very enjoyable. surely the most realistc one to date. cant wait for todays release to play with my friend on multiplayer. if you are series fan you cant miss it. match engine is fun to watch, game is pretty challenging, and once again you can feel almost like a harry redknap or sam alardyce standing next to the touchline. my score is 92/100 - if multiplayer will turn out to be bug-free then its 99/100 cheers.",657.7
"this game is probably the worst ever made.. the skin is confusing, they havent added any new useful options in the game, but worst of all, the game engine..!!! i have never ever, ever!! experienced such a completely useless game engine.. during a match it doesnt matter who you play or whether you play defensive or offensive, the result will always be that the will score at least 2 against you and sometimes you score a lot of goals and sometimes you only score once.. futhermore your players will be injured half of the time.. even when youre on a roll and havent lost 5 games in a row, your team will loose to a team in the bottom..! so much wrong with this game that they really have to make a lot of updates.. and quickly.. even if youre a fan of the series this game is a total catastrophy.. play fm 14, 13 or 12 instead..!",74.7
"match engine is still absolutely dreadful and it looks as though its been designed by people who have never watched a football match in their entire lives, team instructions are not represented at all during the highlights (goalkeepers and defenders do the usual thing of launching long balls instead of doing short passes) and the players act like complete idiots, wingers shooting from the tighest of angles instead of squaring it to a free team mate for a tap in, training is still practically the same as the previous versions with a couple of minor tweaks that dont add anything meaningful short, medium or long term. basically dont waste your money on this, si are taking the money and having a laugh.",225.4

"while no significant changes since fm2014, its a worthy improvement, especially with the new ui. some of the earlier issues have been addressed by the latest updates but still the defensive / crossing aspect of the game engine seems rather flawed. also the motivational man management of the squad can be rather annoying to deal with, its just a matter of learning the best responses to the relevant question. scouting has been much improved (in terms of realism) over recent incarnations of the franchise. worth buying but not an essential purchase 7/10.",257.5

"i ve been playing fm for so many years. after the last two disappointing versions (13, 14) i expected fm15 to be improved. i was wrong. fm15 is poor. the match engine is totally unrealistic. its the same match engine like in fm14. the only improvement are the animations. nothing else. not going to buy fm again in the future. this year was the last time. enough is enough. every year the game is released unfinished. i do not recommend fm15. waste of time and money. also the new menu interface is poor. if si wanted to convince people not to buy fm15 they did it. last, the usual steam issues are another reason not to buy any game that need the steam. waste of money and time guys. dont buy fm15. february and still fm15 is not fixed.",460.4
"based on beta - played all games since day 1 and most have had there issues but then its very hard to wipe out all problems with such a variation of methods. nothing i would class as gaming breaking occured and any issues with 3d engine can generally be ignored or altered tactics wise to suit. easily the best and most comprehensive version thus far, much improvement to gui, scouting etc and requires more patience when lower league. think all the changes are for the better and enjoying new challenge of working out all the new nuances and mechanics.",606.5

"the ui takes a lot of getting used to, even if youre a veteran fm player. even the best players in the world seem to struggle to play properly, for some reason. i dont believe they really went above and beyond with fm15, but it is still an addition to the franchise. its decent but not leaps and bounds above fm14. if you are just getting into the series, pick it up. if you already own fm14 and want a new challenge, its pretty good for that too. i would recommend it.",254.7

"issue for me these days with fm is the staleness of the whole experience. there are things wrong with the match engine as others have pointed out, but the whole series has emphasised width over depth since it moved from being cm to fm - ive been playing since domark versions on the amiga. i remember when we only had text based commentary and the tension was incredible, there was the feeling of just being given enough information and let your imagination fill in the gaps. fm2015 in particular gives you so many features it can initially feel overwhelming, until that is, you realise it doesnt really matter. keep your players happy, make sure your tactics are reasonably sane, gradually improve your squad, and well thats it... obviously, you can complicate that as much as you like if thats what you want, but the whole game experience is totally flat now. every iteration just adds a couple more features that arent really fleshed out much on top of a bunch of features from previous iterations that havent been developed further once they have been introduced. all we seem to really pay 40 (assuming you buy on release) for is a data update and a quick polish - it makes no difference if the dev team have put thousands of hours into each version if the end-users experience is so stale - its lost sight of the end-user experience, and thats what hurts so much. the adding of in-game purchases is also a massive turn-off for me (and others who have given up on fm sooner than i inevitably will); seriously, micro-payment to increase your clubs bank balance? buy editor access? purchase no transfer restrictions? whose idea was this? its awful.",209.8
"its decent installment again but nothing much is new. i paid 35 bucks for this and just upgraded from the beta to the full game and i dont notice a single difference... everything still is as shady as in the beta :( this just wont stand... it means theyve probably had this game ready for ages since the changes are just graphical mostly and want to hussle us as much as they can. of course the engine / card / injury system is messed up on launch as usual too ffs why do i keep falling for their scummy tricks... i cant recommend anyone buying this now, get it for 15-20 bucks and after a few patches and maybe then its a decent update. (had to choose thumbsdown until the state of the game changes, then my review might change too) edit: just got a crash dump error for the second time as well, im done with this till they patch it, back to fm14 it is sigh :( edit #2: the only thing fixed are the crash dumps, i no longer get crashes but the match engine is still so random and terrible that i dont even want to play no more. edit 3: 20/12/2014: almost winter and this game is still a mess, you can lose to the number 18 of the league with your best eleven and then 3 days later win against a stronger opponent with your b-squad for no reason at all. si should be ashamed of themselves.",443.5
"im having a love-hate relationship with this version of the game. theres some stuff to love, and a bit more to hate. but heres the main points: pros: +switching between two teams when managing a club and country is easier +considerably more realistic +sidebar, and game in general, is neat. everything is tidy, easy to look at, easy to find cons: -the team selection screen is so, so clunky -3d match engine is still awful. i still play on 2d because i cannot deal with the mistakes that will happen on 3d, like defenders passing in to their own net far more regularly than irl",168.2
"same game as the last couple of years. its a little better with the newest patch but a lot of things still dont matter. - the teamspeeches dont seem to do anything or you get negative results from it even though the game says you should say that to them. - clubs controlled by the game buy up all of the best players and then dont even let them play, making it very diffecult for you to create a team that can win big prices. the players how go to those clubs and the after a year are put on the transferlist dont want to move to your club because they are playing at a better club even though they didnt play a single match. - scouting uses a system where you can see what percentage your knowledge of a player (0-100%) is but there is no option in the scoutingmenu to say scout to a 100%. and even then at 100% sometimes the players potential still isnt completly scouted. - when asking the board to raise the salarycap for staff members it gets raised by 200 euros which isnt nearly enough to get any improvements. - whenever one of your players get injured during a match its never the games fault. it never gives itself a red or even a yellow card. but you get red cards constantly. - still cant reload my save during matches. its an offline single-player game. if i want to reload my save during a match who cares. these are the main problems. and yet its still very addictive, the best football management game out there and i cant stop playing.",499.1
"i cant recommend this game despite it improving in many ways from previous versions. the reason for this is the focus on player interaction this year. players have always got unhappy for not getting enough game time, too much competition etc. this year not only does this happen more frequently but often without any justification. you then get to try to talk them round which almost always ends in half the squad becoming unhappy. at this point team morale is very low (meaning you lose a lot) and the only way to turn this around is to try and sell most of the team before you get sacked. hopefully si will fix this in the next patch.",647.6
"nope. i love fm since it came out many many years ago, but this version makes me angry. too many shots (up to 50 per match), too many posts hitten (i got 7 in one match). bizarre results (arsenal - qpr 9-5 i.e.). its almost impossible to figure out if you are bad or if it is just the system randomizing too much. reserve players (with a reserve contract) harassing cause they dont play. nope, i am really disappointed :(",329.1
"could be better. its not that bad, but it may not be worth purchasing if you already own fm14. dont bother buying the in-game editor dlc, the freeze attributes option will magically untick every once in a while. besides it kills the enjoyment of the game to make all a players attributes 20.",577.9

"at first i thought this game was a massive step up on fm 14 but after playing for only a few hours i have realised what a massive dissapointment this game really is, i knoiw itss only beta but so many things need changing that i cant see the end products as being that good. first of all injuries are outragious, you are guaranteed to get an injury a game and can find yourself without you key players only 4 games in to the season. second problem is the new match engine the amount of times my players have just stood there and watched charlie adams ping a 50 yard screamer in whilst my keeper does nothing is ridiculos, seriously though the ai rarely do anyting. the transfers are so unrealistic, the value of a player might be 10 million but you will end up having to pay 40 million for a decent player. finally the worst part is the inconsistency of the matches, you can go and play manchester city away and thrash the 6-0 and then lose at home to west brom 4-0 this was a problem in early fm 14 and that got soon fixed, im not saying you should win every game but the game feels too inconsistant, there isnt enough realism in matches. i have been looking forward to fm 15 for a while now and am quite dissapointed so far:( at this stage tbh i wouldt recommend fm 15 untill things have been changed, people are rating this game because i told my player i was gonnna sell him and he got upset that has been in fm for an age and isnt a real addition, there are positives of this game but not enough.",169.5
"i really love this series of games and have played fm since the 2009 edition. this time they have gone a step down in my opinion. the new layout is okay. the interface bar on the left side instead of the top is a great new thing, but from there on its just worse to be honost. the tactic section is clumsy and very few things are better and alot of things are worse. besides from that it seems like the match engine is way worse too. normally there would be some sense of stability, but now i can play as man city and win 8-0 against sporting(por) and then lose againt some 3rd division team 3-6 in the next match. theres an unbelieveable amount of injuries which is so damn frustrating. the search engine has got a makeover that is for the better, although i seem to have a problem finding young players from outside europe without making the leagues playable. all in all a turn for the worse, but most of the problems could be solved with some updates and maybe a choice to chose the old tactics interface (please??). at this very moment i would not recommend it, but as mentioned it could be very recommendable if some fixes come soon. over and out. christian bang",35.4

"as jesus or god or somebody once said, the football manager is my shepherd, i shall not be in want. he makes me feign injury in green pitches, he leads me beside vociferous supporters, he restores my morale. he guides me in paths of tactical righteousness for his names sake. even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of relegation, i will fear no referee, for you are with me; your well fitted suit and your piercingly strong jawline, they comfort me. amen.",216.9
"ive bought every football manager game after the big split and a fair few champ man ones before that. have to say im slightly disappointed by this years offering. very little of interest has been added. sure more conversations to be had but the quickly boil down to the same six or seven answers yourre always giving. the management style is fun but quickly seems pointless and gaining the licenses if little more that a tick box exercise. the engine does look better and although far from perfect the board interaction is more detailed but with the bugs still there. what has to be the most annoying part for me though is the amount of time the game wants you to do basic hr work. from the exciting world or contact negotiations to micro managing every action your apparently half witted staff carry out is long winded. its made even more annoying by the fact your backroom staff rarely follow you and often the first few weeks at a new club (admittedly usually lower league for me) is spent waiting to get a assistant manager before being able to do anything at your new club. all in all its more of the same and the updates are enough to keep me interested.i hope that more effort is but into making the game more fun for those of us who like played 10/20 seasons into the future. more interesting press conferences with much more answer variety and maybe the ability to negotiate not just a move for you but your whole backroom staff. its a begrudging yes vote from me but hopefully with improvements in the future.",944.6

"well in my opinion this is by far the best football manager to date. the graphics on the 3d match are really good the gameplay seems alot smoother goalkeepers actually make really good saves. ive seen alot of people moaning about the beta version what you all need to understand is the whole point of this is so any problems that do occor you let them no they fix it and to be fair there are a few faults. 1. theres way to many injuries within pre season. 2. theres been to many times when the ball is in the box and the strikers or defence dont really do anything about it too many realistic goalscoring chances missed. 3. ridiculous transfer fees i no in fm14 it was the same but it seems unless you have 40 million to spend on one half decent player then you aint getting a half decent player. theres a few more things but i reckon the developers will fix all this before the game is actually released so im not worried. its well worth the money and if your a die hard football manager player then once this little things are fixed youll love it.",272.3

"--- below is my original review, but i have changed it from recommended to not recommended, because even after patching, the game and match-engine is unrealistic; how could the programmers not realise this? i regret buying it and have gone back to fm14.--- this game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, though it does have its problems. id definitely recommend this to fans of the series. lets go through the pros and cons: pros: - i like the new ui, i think its improved on previous titles, with things like scouting/transfers in more logical places - it runs smoother: you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match; instead it takes less than 2 seconds. this means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time. - i havent seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries; its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me. -player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved cons: - weirdly takes longer to save than fm14. over a minute and a half for me. - the games are too high scoring, and this needs to be patched for realism purposes. i just had 5 games that were 6-3, 6-3, 5-3, 0-0 (lol) and 6-3 again... a bit silly... - goalkeepers are pretty bad, hence the high scores. - it feels like its harder to play a possession game, but that might be just because im leicester. its a fun game; im definitely glad i bought it. good for fans of the series; if patched it could be brilliant. they say theyve solved the issue of too many fks going in, but they dont seem to have",88.9
"as much as i love the franchise and the previous releases, this one just doesnt do it for me. its a horrible game atm.. realism; non existing. its basically fm14 with a sidebar, more time wasted on annoying interviews and an, if you can belive it, even worse match engine (the worst one so far in any fm game imo). it has the potential to become a great game, but it needs so, so, so much work that i dont think si will be able to pull it off before the release of fm16. im not going to recommend this game right now, but if there is a god then it might be worth it to check back in 2 or 3 months to see if anything has improved. cheers..",141.2

"as a seasoned fm gamer & previously cm, i am hugely dissapointed with the match engine, i have yet to go three straight games without either a goalkeeping howler/ glitch (for either side) & atleast once a game the keeper will push a ball onto the post where the ball will stop dead to either a slide tackle goal or slide tackle clearance. coupled with 6 strate game in which 2 or more goals were conceded in the last ten mintes with the stench of innevitability. unfortunately due to our loyalty there is no major competitor in site that i could recommend either so you will probably just buy it anyway . . . as i did . . . . and will probably will again",213.7
"i dont know what people are crying about. i havent noticed any problems with the injuries and ive started several saves both in top and bottom tier football. overall this is by far the best football manager thats released to date althought theres still a few bugs here and there like theres pretty much every year. by the january update the game will most likely be pretty much a bug free, which is when most people buy the game anyway. the new match engine is very promising and i think its already better than in the previous versions. the new touchline team talks also seems to be working pretty well and the add another dimension to the game. the new scouting system is also superior compared to the previous versions. and then the new ui... its again way better than before and having the side panel back just makes its so much easier to navigate through the menus. so overall i think its the best football manager game to date, although it still have a few bugs here and there. if you are a fan of the football manager franchise then this is definitely a must buy. remember that the christmas sales are coming soon so its probably worth waiting till then if you havent got the game already by now. and this was written by someone who spents 1000-1500 hours with football manager each year and i own each and every game of the serie including quite a few versions of cm too.",868.5

"i love football manager, but they really messed up with this version. the transfer screen is a mess and it is hard to find new players. everything has been hiden in strange menues and wen you finally find the thing you want to do, you cant remember where you found it. the live game is like watching a game with kids! it is not uncommen to see 8-9 players in a small area and noone can hit the ball. the keeper has two settings: catch every ball or drop everything. it is not uncommen to see your keeper jumping high and it takes forever to hit the ground again. that makes it so easy for the attackers to score. (it is not a bug its a feature)..... dont get me started with the freekicks! if your player has a higher rating then 1 i freeking you will score if it is nearer then 90 meters from the goal! oh i forgot about the demands from the players. i played my first season as brndby and 8... eight ing players demanden to be sold. that was devestating for the morale of the team, but come on! i cannot sell 8 players in one transfer period! at the end of every season do some different players demand to get sold, and they get angry, and so do the rest of the guys, if you do not let them accept an offer. not just any offer ooooh no, but a offer from the last transfer period. that is just plain stupid. you cannot sell a player in a closed marked! the game sucks bigtime. it is harder then ever, so even if you plays manchester united against bradford, you still are up for a huge chalenge! dont buy this game! its a mess and not worth the money! stay with fm14 i know i will undtil most of the bugs are fixed!",401.8
"when they are going to improve the game engine to match up with the new powerful proccessors ?",873.2
"great addition to the series despite a lot of negativity towards it. the new interface is great and improves on last years version, i do agree to an extent that injuries do get a bit ridiculous towards parts of the season - my most memorable being managing wolfsburg and having 7(!) regular starters injured all within a space of 2-3 months. aside from this, everything else has been great. tactics have been spot on, i also tested a few tactics from the workshop and i was surprised at how good some of them were - but it didnt make an instant difference. some tactics took a good 5-10 games to start flowing nicely, otherwise i would find myself conceding at least 2 goals per game. this year i was focusing solely on gaining most of the achievements rather then spending my life going through season to season with my favourite team. ive been an admirer of these games since championship manager 98 and think ive purchased it every year from then. it is true that a lot of the updates could quite easily come into a nice dlc bundle or same game upgrade, however this is not the case. people should note that they are not forced to buy the game every year, their are plenty of dedicated people within the football manager community that focus on updating the databases for older game titles in order for those to keep playing the old game, with the new data. overall i have loved fm15 and am pleased to say that after all these years, sports interactive are still making good progress in providing a richer and more fulfilling football manager.",141.5

"i rate 8/8. but seriously though this is a great game. for the past two years ive spent way too many hours on football manager games and i reckon this wont be any different. yeah there are some problems, yeah it could be better in some ways. but hey, its a brilliant game other than these miniscual problems. i fully recommened it to anyone intrested in football as its a game with so much depth you wouldnt beleive. pros + detail/depth (the database is used by real clubs its accurate!) addictive (you just dont get bored) challenging (its much more challenging than in recent years) interactions (its nice to see much more options in interviews) 3d match engine (yeah its got its problems, explained below, but its still good) new ui design (the new user interface is so much easier to navigate, give it a couple of hours and youll never want o go back) cons - 3d match engine (the only reason its a problem is if your tactics arent good enough it makes the players make stupid mistakes and can be quite unrealisitic and frustrating. but if it was 2d it wouldnt be as bad just because you cant see the mistakes as much. just get your tactics right. match engine (so hard to defend, so easy to score. expect lots of high scoring games for no reason) crashes (this has happened 3/4 times since i got it on the 29/10 happens at any time, hope it gets sorted soon. just set it to save every fortnight and youll be fine) so overall another great game which i much prefer over the recent games and fully recommend.",184.8
"im a big fan of fm games but last few years seems your main enemy is injuries, this version ive been getting 1-2 a game, they start to add up. also why do so many games have huge scorelines like its the norm now, i dont lose often but when i do its by 4-5 goals, this seriously needs sorted out, because im not playing till this and injuries are fixed. i appreciate alot of stuff like updating stats every year that people dont realize how long it takes but still these are fundamentals that can break the whole experience. like i said i do love these games but its just not worth it this year, nothing new that makes it worth another purchase. i prefer to use 2014 and get updates for it.",367.6
"i purchased this game two days ago while it was in the beta version and then today clicked to play and had to wait for a download (which i assume would be the fully updated game) and i have found it is exactly the same as the beta version. i am talking about things like the team badges (prem leauge) in the beta version they are made up and have seen videos on youtube of people playing fm2015 with the teams having the real and correct badges. can anyone tell me how this is and where i am going wrong......i have looked for another update for the game with no luck. the spanish teams have their real crests but most other countries do not so i feel steam have robbed me as i cannot find a way to contact them.",205.0
"i do not like writing about the games i have not completed,but... its rather hard to complete any fm series game. i have already spent some time with the game and i can say, that fm 2015 is good as always - which means perfect. i had some problems to get used to a bit new look of the menus after spending hundreds of hours in the previous edition, but after 5 hours i realized, that it is now even more clear and comfortable. there is no need now to click through three windows to find interesting stats or anything else. the authors added even more tactical features, which make the impression, that you have even greater control of the way the team plays the matches. the graphic got better, though its the least important part and of course the data base is updated adding thousands of new players, managers and more.. its impossible to describe this game shortly and there is no sense in writing poems about it. if you have never played any football manager game and are at least a bit interested in football, then give it a try. and if you have played, then you probably do not any recommendation.",213.2

"unfortunately the makers of fm have not learnt from their mistakes last time. they have yet again released a game with so many bugs there is no point buying the game until around february when all the patches have been released to correct the bugs. the testing process before the game is issued is terrible - is there actually one at all?. this could be such a good game, but is really bad. and they insist on players using this ridiculous steam platform to run the game through. hate it.",9.9

"so i have played fm15 after previously having the 2013 and 2008 versions. when i got my self on the 2013fm i saw a lot of changes between it and 2008. the 2015 hardly brought any changes at all. there are maybe 2 or 3 new speches in team talk, some more advanced conversations with players which are actualy harder to talk to and overal the personal chat has been developed. yes theres also a 3d game play shown rather than 2d which actualy does not add anything to a manager expirience and in my opinion is nice but unnecesary. there are few minor bugs with the game, theres also a fair play requirements to get into european competitons but other than that theres not a lot of new suprises. this is still my favourite football manager game but other than few little changes, updated squads and competition rules this game is preety much the old 2013 manager to me. its still a good game worth a buy if your upgrading your football manager 6/10. just because i expected a bit more new features. 10/10 if this is going to be your first one or much older than 2013.",853.2

"unsure on which way to swing with this game, its good but so broke, in saying that though 14 was broke up until january. what annoys me about this game is how awful your goalkeeper becomes when your 1-0 up with 10 mins left, the amount of games ive drew or lost being 1-0 up with 10 mins left is unreal. but because i have faith in si id say buy it but when its in a sale or something cause 30 is far too much for a game that is still broken",145.5

"absolutely baffled by some of the negative comments about the game. ive not played fm since fm 12 so maybe the minor improvements over the years impress me more than most. i agree that the training is a liitle poor and needs work and i have only played 15 hours but overall ive found the game very good. its not outstanding like the earlier versions but it is always going to be difficult to develop it so far forward without ruining the gaming or changing it beyond recognition. so far i havent had any major issues with injuries and the match engine is fine with no silly mistakes and goals from all over the pitch. if youve not played fm for a while like myself then buy it but it appears if you have been buying it year in year out then maybe you need to take a break away from the keyboard, get some fresh air, a bit of sun and come back to it in a year or two. oh and some places sell the game for 20 which isnt a lot really.",222.9
