"amazing, the mods keep the fun going. becareful with console commands some can screw you over but i highly recommend this game",9.0
"didnt like much, ok game but too many fillers, followers badly managed it was a stupid idea to have followers death only from your attacks, combats get tedious rather soon, main story fail grab, and the abuse of dragons is a terrible design.",95.7

"this game is the best u can be in your own world in this game. if you like free rome then u will love this game",152.9
"great game, first off i recommend mods as they add new experience to the game. second of all, youll enjoy the new open world the company bethesda has created. for those who have played oblivion, the interfaces is a bit different but as you play you will get use to the changes.",54.0
"very good game takes about 20-30 minutes to install in the very begining it sucks a bit but than it starts to ger kickass.....",18.2
"great game, graphical not so good, but gameplay fantastic! getting tired of playing games that you need to do the main quest to unlock special things? not in this game! here you can go from dragonborn to just a normal farmer in no time! and with amazing side-quests this game will just become unstoppable!",258.4
"a great game for adventure aswell as messing about! anything thats not in game can just be modded in very compatible and very easy to get the way you like!",182.6
"a very enjoyable game, hours of gaming and stuff to find out, plus theres the workshop and other kind of mods so you can add more interesting or not logical stuff to the game! :p",37.7
"dragonborn, dragonborn by his honor is sworn to keep evil forever at bay! and the fiercest foes rout when they hear triumphs shout, dragonborn, for your blessing we pray! hearken now, sons of snow, to an age, long ago and the tale, boldly told, of the one! who was kin to both wyrm and the races of man with a power to rival the sun and the scrolls have foretold of black wings in the cold, that when brothers wage war come unfurled! alduin, bane of kings, ancient shadow unbound, with a hunger to swallow the world! but a day, shall arise, when the dark dragons lies, will be silenced forever and then! fair skyrim will be free from foul alduins maw! dragonborn, dragonborn by his honor is sworn to keep evil forever at bay! and the fiercest foes rout when they hear triumphs shout, dragonborn, for your blessing we pray!",604.9
"amazing game soo much better having access to mods",31.0
"skyrim is the first elder scrolls game i have ever played, and i must say its amazing! i am personally not a guy who likes magic or fantasy games but skyrim puts in a little realism and fantasy to give a wonderful experience to the players. i love the enviroment and soundtrack that make up the ultimate world. i definitley recomend this game if your a fan of the fallout series by bethesda. the game could inlcude a few glitches but you can always get unofficial patches which fix these glitches. overall this game is amazing with exciting and interesting quests, defenitlly recomend.",103.7
"after putting in 100+ hours on the xbox 360 version, i still bought this game a second time through steam. even after 2 years since its release, im still loving this game. its just one of those games you can always go back to and find something new to try out.",90.7
"i was attacked by a dragon before i even reached riverwood, before it blew fire at me it said ima need about tree fiddy. now it was about this time that i realized what i thought was a dragon was an 8 story tall crustacian from the paleozoic era. i yelled to it i aint givin you no tree fiddy you damn monster! and it then retreated into the wilderness, never to be seen again. 11/10 would paleozoic era again.",76.9
"best game i have ever played you will never run out of quests and if you do you can always take over a bandit fort. the game never gets old",526.9
"i just love the smell of dragon breath in the morning!",208.6
"tell me lies tell me sweet little lies haha no seriously todd where the  are my spears",634.0
"as a huge elder scrolls fan, i am pathetic when it comes to how many versions of this game i own. i have played skyrim on ps3, xbox 360, and then now on pc. its a very well made game and i whole-heartedly love it. the open world and countless quests provide days or even weeks of fun rather than hours. ive noticed there are mods galore for the pc version so its like adding even more time to that.",93.3
"if your reading this review because you dont know what skyrim is then 1) your not a gamer 2) stop reading and go buy it... now! in my top 5 games of all time.. so far",60.3
"greatest game ever thanks to the modding community",1006.2
"this is one of the time consuming games ive ever played, the lore is fantastic, the scenery is awe inspiring, and the amount of freedom it offers is unprecedented. if youve got the cash, get this game.",331.5
"tbh, i was dissapointed with oblivion. it was not the fantasy alien work of morrowind. skyrim is like a spoof of oblivion. the dialogue is obnoxious compared to the past serious es games. the map, once you have seen it, that is the end of interest pretty much, there are alot of areas on the map that i thought were a fail. strange but oblivion and fallout3 were much better designed games. believe it or not. skyrim is not terrible, but i found it impossible to interact, like or believe any of the character npcs. definitely not enough khajit.",6.3
"its skyrim. do anything you want, go where you want, be what you want to be.",113.7
"skyrim is one of the best games. as you can deviate from your course and do what ever the hell you want.",371.6
"on both content and game play this game has it all. although i get tired of the dragon slaying theme skyrim has outdone itself since oblivion/elder scrolls 4.",173.5
"skyrim is one of the most engaging and vast action rpgs to date. if you love games, this game merits a play for any gamer.",773.5
"incredible rpg with tons of things to do, places to explore and suprises to uncover. 10/10",230.5
"best game ever you are not a gamer until u play this",150.4
"in the first hour of playing the game i acidently killed a chicken then everyone in the town came to get revenge for it. 20/10",141.3
"for those who loves open world games, this game is a perfect choice. travelling around, killing people, you can do anything.......not everything tho. so yeah.",70.7
"instructions unclear. caught dragon in ceiling fan",15.3
"pure awesomness! very nice rpg - a little bit buggy (as all of bethesdas ones), but great. so many stories inside, so you can play for many hours before you actually move along with the main story line.",287.7
"if you put a pot on someones head, the person magicly forgets you, but dont steal butter knives 10/10",300.8
"i cannot put into words how amazing this is, but i will try for the sake of this review. in the elder scrolls v: skyrim, you are the mighty dovahkiin, dragonborn. you can battle with the ancient, and powerful dragons, shout in the tongue of dovah, solve a civil war, and you can even have a beard! but, seriously, chracter customization has increased greatly. not that i really care for such a thing.. the quests are sublime in all aspects, if only buggy at times, along with the rest of the game. the scenery is immersive, and more realistic than any of the elder scrolls. there is a massive amount of content, even more with the dlcs, and the dlcs are worth the extra fourty dollars. upon the dlc remark, i did feel that the dawnguard questline was a little lacking, but the added features make up for that. the lore of skyrim is also very interesting. these are my words of truth, outlander. until i inform you again, talos guide you.",141.8
"awesome rpg!!! has loads of mods for pc as well, so if you get bored with the default skyrim story line, then you can just easily install mods. overall, you have no excuse not to buy this game.",50.0
"you can assasinate their leaders, murder their people, steal their wealth. but you better not kill that ing chicken or they will come after you without remorse. 10/10, wouldnt dare to pluck a feather off that chicken.",45.3
"so many of you know me as a hardcore gamer and i am. i have played numerous games over a period of 25 years and i can tell you that this game is easily in the top 3. skyrim is a masterpiece that has easily 200 hours of content. basically, it is a single player mmo.",417.4
"super fun! you guys have to get it, the only thing that bothers me is that i should have waited to buy it when it went on sale! still a fun game andtotally worth the $20, plus you can mod it which adds so much more once youve completed the game!",66.6
"awesome game. when you play it you become attached and pretty much lose yourself in the mythical land of skyrim.",193.0
"awesome game will keep you on the computer for quitea bit",16.9
"...i...cant...stop...playing...please...help...me... 11/10",675.0
"too many bugs and should be recalled if bugs are not fixed",777.5
"great game! a definite improvement in an awesome series. if youre a fan of elders scrolls then theres no question you will enjoy this game.",87.7
"!!! warning !!! this game will suck up all of your time !!! skyrim has been an amazing game through and through. i highly recommend this game as a time waster/consumer/eater. no matter what i do, everytime i play this game i play for five minutes and 5 hours have past, as most games that are moddable, this game can be greatly enhanced (whether by hd graphics or by actual gameplay) by mods. tl;dr great game, really worth it.",62.4
"buy this game! but be warned, you will not see sunlight again.",117.9
"theres no doubt that skyrim was awesome on my game console but since i built my gaming rig, gaming has never been the same since. plus the fact that i can pretty much mod skyrim how i please makes it a far more better gaming experience than in any game console. i definately recommend this game for those who wish to get more out of skyrim and keep one playing for hours hours and hours.",910.6
"the best game bethesta has came out with! so much to do and the detail of this game is fantastic. some buggs but definitely worth getting! 9.5/10",78.3
"again, why am i writing a review? who does not like skyrim?",121.6
"dont be fooled by my puny play time, i play offline most of the time due to my bad internet connection, the truth is i have spent well over a hundred hours playing this epic game, seriously just buy this game, this game is worth more than $60, there is literaly hundreds of hours worth of play time on this game, not considering multiple playthroughs, dlcs, and mods so many freakin mods!!! buy this game and i guarantee your friends and family wont be seeing you for a couple of months",119.8
"i accidentaly press e on coin and steal it the guy started killing me he chased me i got enough of that  i reborn dead and laugh my  off fair enough 11/10 - ign",3.5
"although its an old game, it is still a great game.",33.9
"easy to get lost in the land of skyrim with all its characters and open world gameplay. one of the few games that rewards you for exploration. a must try for any gamer!",324.9
"i havent been this excited to play a game in at least 10 years.",63.2
"amazing game thats full of adventure and excitment. and jump scares when a skeever comes out of nowhere",22.3
"ran my horse into a dragon, died about 2 seconds later. still trying to get better armour than iron. 11/10",26.1
"best game ever <3!!!! epic fights, tons of things to do, and arrows to the knee! you know you want it so buy it!!!!",24.2
"if this game was a banana, it would be a good banana",247.6
"although i only recently purchased skyrim, i must thank a good friend of mine to give me his copy. i accumulated over 600hrs since 2012, and i had to buy the game for myself. skyrim is not without its flaws, suffering from a bland main plot and some bugs. but this is one of those games that you will never put down. like all other elder scrolls games, the world and lore is giant and immersive. after completed the main storyline quickly, i was a little disappointed. the main storyline leaves much to be desired, but that is not what kept me playing skyrim. there are multiple story arcs that you may complete that do not necessarily contribute to the main storyline, some are great, others are tetius. i only put maybe 30hrs into the main storyline, and after that is when skyrim really begins to shine. exploring skyrim is amazing, reading lore, discovering dwemer ruins, participating in a civil war, it never gets old. at this point, modding is a great idea. installing an enb makes it look better than some games released in late 2013, mods that add quests and expand on the world, with mods the game is truly endless. i will never stop playing skyrim. 9.5 near perfect.",295.7
"bethesda makes another masterpeice dominateing over all other games 10/10",118.7
"love this game hours of fun and never stops ending with the mods that keep coming out.",67.0
"played this game for over 1000 hours on ps3 way better on pc. a must have for any action/adventure/rpg game fan. i would recomend this game as it has tons of content and lots of replay vaule a true gem as any elder scrools game is.",58.6
"its decent on its own, but this game shines when mods are installed. it is as if the game was purposefully left baren so the community could fill it in. 4/5, was worth the ten bucks i paid",127.4
"a lot has been said about skyrim, and i wont start reiterating. from my own experiences, skyrim did not achieve what it was tasked to do: creating an immersive world. dont get me wrong, it is still a good game, but it is not space rangers. mostly the problem is that the game is crafted for the player. the world is a stage, a facade, and the npc:s are actors on it. there are no events outside the players control and the world does not feel vibrant and lively. i understand that requesting a living, dynamic game world is unreasonable for a game with as intensive graphics as skyrim, but still... but yes, skyrim is the best elder scrolls-type game yet made. it is a very pretty sandbox full to the brim with detail and places to go. it is a sandbox adventure game of best quality. and a roleplaying game of mediocre level, at best.",122.1
"i had a life but then i took an arrow in the knee. best-game-ever-period.",619.2
"decent game, but the pc version isnt without console-ridden features that annoy mouse/keyboard users like myself. hopefully a modder will address this issue. skyrim in no way threatens morrowind goty as my all-time favorite elder scrolls game. there is some fun to be had in skyrim but be warned its very streamlined and built for the masses instead of niche open world rpg lovers specifically. the price at $60 is a bit steep but you can get many hours out of this game, despite bugs and streamlining, and numerous annoying console-esque run-ins with the interface/menu.",1137.1
"best game ever played, the mods make the possibilities infinite! can kill dragons 10/10",62.8
"absolutely awesome game! the current price (13,59 for the legendary edition) is nothing compared to the adventures u are going to see. endless mods will cause hundreds of gameplay hours full of joy, fascinatiion, beauty and epicness. i reallly recommend this game to all of you! if u like rpg`s ull love this version :)",53.2
"the base game is okay. not amazing, not terrible, enough to keep you entertained for a decent amount of time. like its counterparts in the elder scrolls and fallout series developed by bethesda, however, it is saved by a large and vibrant modding community. granted, there is a bit of learning to do before leaping in, so as to make sure you dont crash all the time, but it is well worth the effort. first of all, there exists a series of patches that fix the vast majority of the games bugs. on the graphics side, there are countless retextures, remeshes, and, for those with better rigs, enbs to make the game look beautiful. there are also plenty of gameplay changes and fan-made items and quests if youre looking for something a bit meatier. for example, as of june 11th, fully functioning dwarven jetpacks have been available for download. i could go on about all the cool mods available, but really, if you wouldnt pay $5-7(or whatever it goes on sale for now) for jetpacks in skyrim, you might just need to reevaluate your priorities.",80.0
"modded it until it broke, reinstalled it and started modding again. 10/10",197.6
"best rpg iv played next to oblivion , having the ability to mod makes this game timeless.",145.2
"a very worthy sequel to oblivion. the scenery is beautiful, gameplay simple and as always the storyline is quite immersive. however there are intermittent crashes which can get annoying if you havent saved that often.",50.4
"amazing game, truly worth the investement. great characters (with the exception of nazeem), stunning landscapes.",138.4
"awesome game never gets old especially when you get mods 11/10",160.5
"what do you get if you take oblivions aesthetics and trim out the fat and extraneous elements, take morrowinds vast amount of stuff to stumble upon in your explorations, and then make the combat not suck? well probably a mess given oblivion is a piece of software and therefore not possessed of fatty lipids to trim out, so now you probably have lard all over your floor or something and that greasy crap is really hard to scrub out plus itll go rancid and everything. oh yeah skyrims pretty good also.",304.1
"an awesome game, with plenty of quests, stunning landscapes and incredible background stuff !!!",131.5
"i fully recomed this game because its really fun and sometimes very hard",15.3
"if you enjoy elder scrolls, this one is amazing. played through it a few times and still running into things i didnt know about. all around great rpg with a lot of variety for different play styles.",281.7
"so. much. stuff! overwhelming at times, in a good way. highly detailed open world for all of us to explore. years of replayability and storylines upon storylines upon storylines. another masterpiece from bethesda. the only thing i find odd from them is the way your character walks around with his weapons out like hes going to hand them to the enemy. minor issue, so minor its actually amusing to me now. oh, you want this!? of course my really liking this wonderful game doesnt stop me from calling it fallout and the holy grail. looking for castle anthrax to administer some spankings.",150.5
"the game is quite the graphical achievement but it fails to deliver on the deeper levels that an elder scrolls game or any rpg should went you look past the inherited lore assets. from a technical and modder standpoint the game goes above and beyond the mess that gamebryo engine games have been known for leaving it a very buggy and difficult game to mod which is the only saving grace of the game: almost anything thats wrong with the game can be changed through modding. notice how i say changed not fixed. the amount of hours you are bound to put into the game before realizing its faults are well worth the value of the game but i cant bring myself to recommend it as their are many other games on the market capable of the same thing. dlcs however are not worth their value for the play time they offer by any means however.",602.6
"over 400 hours of play time. nothing more to say! but its only _real_ fun with mods like skyui (the inventory-overhaul), the unofficial patches, 2k hd-textures and locational damage, for example. you should really look into mods before you start playing. installing them is not that tricky! i recommend the homepage skyrim nexus (-> google) with its mod manager.",425.6
"one of the best experiences in gaming, add in mods and its also one of the most creative and it looks great to boot.",70.5
"with amazing graphics, great gameplay, and an amazing story, + a massive world with tons of weapons, spells, and armor types. and top that off with a massive modding comunity. set aside some minor glitches, and i recomend it.",38.9
"go back and  urself dragon age, here comes the ture rpg!",44.2
"dropped a cabbage and the entire town started fighting over it. 10/10 in the end i decided to keep the cabbage.",137.3
"with a little imagination you can lose hundreds of hours in skyrim. 5/5*",164.1
"best game developed by bethsteda!!!! i give the game 4.5 stars / 5 stars. i wish the game had a longer story line because i feel there can be so much more implemented into the game.",118.1
"the best elder scrolls game and the easiest to play. the replayability is high as you try different things. note that you will need that 1gb video card and quadcore or higher cpu just to play this game. the only drawback is the menu interface, but there are mods for that. i also highly recommend all 3 expansions (dawnguard to increase the peril; dragonborn to add item variety and eliminate gameplay annoyances (such as friendly fire); and hearthfire to expand your characters domestic life (and add more npcs)). although there are still a few bugs, dont be discouraged as this game with expansions is well worth $45.",625.0
"100+ hours of gameplay! what more can you ask for? pick it up when it goes on sale for $5.......win",54.6
"this game is f*cking awesome! there is no better singleplayer game in the world. only thing i dont like on this game is there is some small bugs. and co-op multiplayer would be awesome on game like this.",60.9
"another great game from bethesda. tis a shame that steam has to be running to play it (i would rather have the overheads used by steam to shove more mods into skyrim).",572.7
"this game is amazing! it features a large open world to explore, and many quests to complete. a large variety of armor and weapons is availabe as well. i would recommend this game to anyone wishing to play an exciting rpg.",58.9
"by far one of my favourite games of 2011. this game is addictive, lengthy and fun as hell and keeps you wanting more and more as you trudge through ever side-quest possible.",144.6
"a mod here, a crash there, and im spiderman flying with some hot chick in a rainbow dash mustang 4.5/5",68.4
"i am the dragonborn. i am the mudcrab. koo koo kachoo. why are you not playing this? i bought and downloaded this with slightly barren expectations towards this game after the previous fallout and oblivion games that bethesda has released from their studios. recalling clunky animations and a loose combat system, i was only mildly enthused. and then i looked outside and noticed it was dark and i hadnt eaten in twelve hours. utterly immersive, the animations are fantastic-- provided you dont zoom the camera out. callback to the other bethesda games-- horrible jump animation, go! but seriously, there is so much to do in this game, that you will never be done. ever. and if you are, you arent a real person, you forfeited that right about 2,532 hours ago. go outside.",215.4
"the definitive sandbox rpg. the best of the series so far",192.0
"great mods, huge map, midieval age like gta, tones of submissions, freely messing around, pick pockets, break into npcs house, kill the city guards, non-essential npcs being killed and their house is become to you. sh*t! this must be the best game i had ever played.",180.6
"my dad was playing skyrim right? so he was using the xbox360 controllerr for pc and he was trying to store his random ingredients in his cabnit. so he thought he was storing it all but... he ate deathbell,human heart,giants toe,nightshade,butterfly wings and more!!!!! he was pressing a! a is eat x is store!!! that ends my tragic tale. 10/10",306.2
"third time i bought this game (different systems) and still loving every bit of it. i must admit that the pc version has been the most fun because of the posibility of modding the bejesus out of this game, making it even better :d must buy!",95.5
"elder scrolls v, well, lets see here... fantastic performance on most computers, resolution quality is also very nice & supportive. the 5th is very much like the last game oblivion holding few differences but also lacking in areas the old oblivion had complete. mod support has always been there for elder scrolls, however, its the first to have a workshop on steam that allows simple access to mods without 3rd party websites. sadly, the workshop only allows so much in file size and not every mod can be found leading to a down point for this. the game: the game is great, 2 hand control, dragons, fire, magic, beautiful skys & weather. the game has alot to offer including a new map and characters for a new story. the game does lack some features but can be fixed with mods. the game also has users wondering what happened to all the skills we had in the past elder scroll games, but slowly we forget about that after mods. mod support is really what makes this pc version alive. :) graphics: 8.0 soundfx: 8.5 gameplay: 8.0 fun factor: 7.0 total rating: 8.0",71.8
"its very anticlimactic and lame at times, but the ability to have an adventure with so many opportunities for doing things how you want to is very, very addictive.",1138.6
"it does not feel as good as morrowind back in the day, but surely takes place as one of the most amazing single player rpgs with open world.",212.7
"buy this game. now im serious, this is a matter of life or death. buy this game or my review shall forever haunt your very soul. 10/10 (in case you werent paying attention)",188.1
"hello everybody!! today we have a game, and this game is called.................. the elder scrolls v: skyrim!!!!! its got action packed babes and motheras who like kill u and stuff so just get it when on sale baby!!!!!!!",135.9
"awsome! amazing but dont have time to play it many time, but it is little boring in begining",11.7
"great game with quality dlcs. i never go more than a day or two before hopping back into that world.",271.7
"so i put off buying this game for a long long time. i picled up the legendary edition at the christmas sale. now i wish i had bought it on release. with all the mods available and the awesome modding community on reddit, this is the most fun ive had since half-life was released... playing a game. would buy again!",135.3
"this game is absolutely amazing, there is a reason why its rated 94 out of 100!",23.7
"hands down one of the best games of all time! the lore, the world, the gear!!! this game is amazing! you can spend hundreds and hundreds of hours in this game, with the same save, and still find dozens of new npcs, dungeons and miscellaneous quests! the combat is fun and satisfying. the voice acting can tend to get a little dull at times seeing as pretty much everyone is voice acted by this same small amount of people. the in game secrets, references, and easter eggs are brilliant. especially the three billy goats gruff easter egg. there are dozens of books to read which add plenty of extra lore and history to the games continents and world called nirn. skyrim is an amazing province, with its massive mountains, swamps, grasslands and so on. the dlcs are also brilliant! adding dozens to hundreds of hours of extra gameplay! the worst parts about the game has probably got to be the common quest glitches, which stop you from starting or proceeding in a quest. some quests also dont have quest markers at times. the levelling up also takes hours. 215 hours and im level 62. its gonna take a while to reach level 80. anyway, this game is brilliant and a must own. buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy",289.2
"yes i recommend this game to all! this is a amazing game with awesome graphics! i enjoy playing every second!",41.7
"what an amazing game! for all rpg fans, a must have! you can play it in your own way, no stupid locked classes. immense world and lots of missions (and submissions) to play. great music in landscapes, battles, etc. you got a great map to explore and many adventures. if you want other things you can simply download new-mods in the workshop! ( there are also other mods online, but keep in mind, not everything is trustable! ) or if there arent fun things, you can create it yourself with the creation kit. tes:v is a really fun game! my metascore: 9.2 / 10.0",114.5
"this is probably one of the best games that i have eve rbought, if youre thinking about buying this, dont hesitate. its one of the best!",211.8
"i dont have a life anymore because of this game. but damn i love it.",578.3
"i had play the game on xbox 360 for more then 130 hours, but wow with the special at 20$ for all the package and the free hd texture package its a bargain for me. i will restart a new adventure from the scrath of one of my best game ever !!",2.3
"beautiful landscaping, intense battles and quests, elegant storylines, and a soundtrack to die for. i  you not when i say i bought the whole album on itunes (yes its on itunes. go get it.) i never used to like old medievela games with dragons and  like that but this game grabbed my attention faster than a farmer grabs a cows balls. 15/10 i totally recommend",7.9
"you need talos, you need his love inside of you. you need all of the nine divines inside of you.",70.3
"game of the year 2011. i am not surprised. i like the way they shifted away from the confusing stat system. lots of freedom in the game allowing you to play how you like. there are a ton of mods that make this game even more great. dawnguard dlc is almost a must if you plan to be a part of any supernatural clan.",667.5
"amazing game, the moddability makes it epic! get nexus mod manager though, it is far better. you can get the game to load mods from both the steam workshop and nexus with a bit of work, as long as you are careful about conflicts. cannot wait for tes6, with next-gen graphics and tesselation it is going to be beautiful.",243.8
"i would recommend this game. it will take up a lot of your time playing it, but worth it.",30.4
"its never too late to buy this game. buy it right now. now. now. now!",116.5
"got over encumbered after picking up a feather 11/10 would pick up more feathers",260.0
"never got tired of this game, because of its immensity, variability and beauty. the music is epic, charming and relaxing. a downside of this game, are the few but annoying bugs, but the majority of them can be easily fixed. the vanilla game itself can get repetitive sometimes, but with the addition of mods, the game is practically infinite. 8.5/10",624.6
"best rpg ive ever played, despite its early bugs and glitches this game has surpassed expectations and is to be considered an instant classic. 95%",276.1
"this game is super fun.it provides hours upon hours of new quests and adventures all around skyrim",38.8
"this game is awesome. i can play anytime and the mod provides me lots of more fun.",307.0

"really fun game. i had it on ps3, but i couldnt get into it. the graphical quality was pretty bad, and i wasnt a fan of the controls. on pc, you can get the hd texture pack if you have a good graphics card, and turn the settings up. it looks great, and plays well. also, theres console commands, so if youre in trouble, you can get yourself out of it. controls in combat are a bit odd, because weapons are inverted for your mouse buttons, but i swapped them. takes a bit of getting used to, but its much better. you can explore and discover new places, and fight bandits in dungeons. you can create potions and armor, buy a house to store your stuff in, and take on many different quests. you can join different factions as well, even become a werewolf. great game, would buy. if you dont have 30 bucks, wait up until its on sale and grab legendary edition.",71.6

"you have probably heard of how this game is fantastic. you probably also heard about how amazing the pc version is. well theyre right. you can have absolutely stunning visuals with the aid of mods (check my screenshots if you want), the amount of storylines availible is huge, even simple dungeon crawling is immersive, and pretty much every minor flaw in the game is covered by the amazing mod community. great buy for 9.99 an absolute steal for 4.99",81.8

"awesome game but still not as good as custers revenge",6.1
"absolutely stunning game. i loved morrowind, hated oblivion, but i think bethesda hit the nail right on the head with skyrim. the world is huge, beautiful, and full of things to do. the guilds are a step back from what they were in morrowind and oblivion in terms of content and story, which is my biggest problem with this game. other than that, though, its an amazing adventure.",12.3
"i have played this beauty on xbox 360 and it was amazing until i got it for the pc which was alot better considering all the mods you can use with it. if you do not recommend/like this game there is obviously somethig wrong with you and you need to reconsider what you are doing with your life.",17.8

"up there with one of the best games ive ever played. come on, you know about skyrim already.",74.2
"a very good game. i would recommend skyrim on the pc over skyrim on a console any day. there is so much more that you can do on a pc than on a console. for example on a console youre happy you just completed the game and defeated alduin and you walk into whiterun and then you stop now what do you do, but if your on pc youre like i know what to do and the next thing you know your on the nexus. so what im trying to say is skyrims more fun with mods. you dont even have to get mods that completely change skyrim just get a few quest mods for more gameplay.",85.0
"i never really understood why people loved rpgs, i was always an fps player, but this game.... all i can say is wow. it will pull you in and keep you immersed in the land, the story, and the action. i have put in over 2000 hours in this game in the past two years and im still loving it. with bethesda supporting the modding community by releasing the creation kit, new mods come out daily, adding all kinds of new content. if you can think of it, you can probably download it on the workshop or on nexus. every gamer should play this, no matter what genre you prefer",725.0
"mod this game and its one of the deepest, most absorbing game of the last generation. without mods its kind of shallow in my opinion, a problem i didnt have with the fallout games. i can honestly say ive crossed the mark where theres no more fun in it for me, but trust me, youll enjoy this one. its awesome for the most part! also, thomas the train.",215.3

"so, let me start by saying this is the first rpg game like this that ive played, and at first i thought eh, surely people are just bigging the game up, i doubt itll be as good as they all say never have i been more wrong skyrim instantly took a dragonrend-style hold on my soul, from the first line of dialouge i was hooked. from there on, after learning many a word of power, i have used the thuum for many purposes, such as making rabbits fly into the air, or setting nazeer on fire... a lot. i have slayed dragons, become a vampire, become a werewolf, i now run the thieves guild, the dark brotherhood (yet still people threaten to set them on me) and i have saved skyrim from many dooms. this game, this game has given me meaning. given me hope. i am dovahkin. i am the dragonborn. also, shouting at crabs till they die never fails to amuse me 11/10",105.9
"lets see... great character customization, almost unlimited weapon and armor combinations, in-depth side quests, great storyline, and dragons. yep. i like this game.",58.2
"after all this years game is still broken. bethesda did nothing, nothing to fix it just relesed more dlc that broken game even more... never ending quests, flying items when you open doors, broken animation, many annoying bugs like; not working weapons racks, eh and billions more. for all that i will not recommend this game, if you can somehow see through all that maybe.",183.2

"if you played any of the elder scrolls previews instalments and liked it, you are going to love this game. it improves a lot of the flaws of the previews games, adds a better menu system and has a lot of stuff to do and most quest are really enjoyable.",0.1

"quite possibly one of my favorite single player rpgs. its even better with mods from the skyrim nexus or the steam workshop. plus its the only game where punching a chicken gets you a higher bounty than hitting a child with a battle axe!",14.7
"what can i say about this game that hasnt been said already? this game will take a few hours to finish the main story line, however this is where the game starts. there are 2 massive side quests (thieves guild and dark brotherhood) which are ver enjoyable, and not to mention literally hundreds of other quest that can take anything from a few hours to a few minutes. buy this game.",93.2
"if i dont bring out this game onto my endorsed list i might as well quit gaming and become a chair... alright so skyrim, the newest installement in the elder scroll series gives you another wonderous oppertunity to walk out in a world and get completely lost... be ready to restrain yourself incredibly and set schedules for if you dont youll be playing hours on end without ending 1 thing because you always started persueing other things you came acros meanwhile... there is so much you can do in the game ill simply refer to the game website for info on it. must: mod this game! look for awesome mods and add them into your game, the community is the real power behind the fact that this game is brilliant! oh and do enjoy the glitches that sometimes appear, they often give you weird comical relief on the right moments :) i played a good 60 hours now nearly but i know friends who spent 300+ hours in this game and still were going on... buy it, its like a lifetime subscription to awesome.",213.0
"an amazing game to pass time or to just relax and have fun. steam workshop has had many great and exiting mods to continue your experience. some may find this game dumded down from its predecessor but its still a great game none the less. even without the dlc, skyrim is still a very enjoyable game to play and have fun.",292.4
"i have always been a fan of the elder scrolls, and this game to me was just another amazing advancement in the ongoing struggle in tamriel. there is too much to go on about, but if your into rpgs and you dont need the feel of mmo, then i highly recommend skyrim, and all the installments from the series.",297.8
"the base game itself could have been black and white with no voice acting and nothing wouldve changed. the combat is beyond basic and is honestly what i would expect in a mobile game. rpg elements are almost non-existant, no more spell crafting or multi choice dialogue. npcs are more lifeless than barbie dolls and some of them are immortal because people these days would complain if they accidently killed someone important. mods can fix almost everything in this sandbox. sadly the only thing they have yet to fix is the one button (two if you dual wield) melee combat. enbs and mods also make this one of the best looking games around. if youre not willing to mod then prepare to get bored within 50 hours, otherwise you will find hundreds of hours of new questlines, conversions and even brand new lands (or even old lands such as morrowind) to explore.",886.0
"i have been a long time console player who has just recently jumped into pc gaming. the elder scrolls series has always been one of my favorites. skyrim is an incredibly time-consuming and addictive game. i put hundreds of hours into the game while playing on my xbox 360. i am incredibly happy with what i have been able to experience in the short amount of time that i have played in the game on pc. the huge amount of mods that are available add a whole new level to an already amazing game. i am very glad that i have repurchased this game!",12.7

"i love this game! this is the perfect game for anyone who enjoys dragons, killing and questing.",110.0
"despite the fact this game is the second most played on my list--i have to say it is not one of my all-time favorites. yes, it does a number of things well. the environment (with graphical and sound enhancement mods) is truly beautiful and enchanting. but the gameplay is pretty bland. some of the dungeon crawls feel more streamlined and *fun*. but i never found myself truly lost in a dungeon. the puzzles were mostly a stupid easy game of *match* and the layouts were rarely ever anyting except linear. you could always count on there being a shortcut way to the exit. because retracing your steps to see the aftermath of your epic (in the case of this game, not-so-epic) battles on the way out would just be boring. afterall, you have another fetch quest to complete. better squeze that in asap. im sure many of my complaints about this game are addressed in mods. however, i would have to find such a mod. compare that mod with its cousin mod that tries to do the same things. and then determine which of the mods i like best, and which of the pitfalls of the mod i feel are less bad than the alternative. its just too much. i love modding. but when a game needs modded at such a fundamental gameplay level to be engaging and exciting.....im gonna have to hit the lottery to have time for that.",631.1
"this game literally keeps getting better and better. my first character was a paladin archetype, going around saving the world. while a lot of fun (still), this meant passing up some of the questlines. the next character i created is a magic/archery oriented thief and assassin, and holy crap, theres a lot of fun to be had sneaking about and stealthily taking people down like skyrim batman. theres also the fact that this game is just beautiful to look at. if you dont have it already, get it.",185.1
"would have been the perfect game if not for lydia giving me sass about carrying stuff. im the dragonborn, god dammit, just be quiet and carry the remains of this gigantic dragon i just bare-knuckle punched to death.",24.5
"this game is amazingly awesome! the free roaming, orc killing and cave exploring makes me moist. 10/10, would fap again.",120.4
"if you only buy one game for the next 3 years, make it this one. the vanilla game is deep and enthalling; enough to keep you going for months to come. the vast array of quality mods, however, could keep you busy for the rest of your life. even if it is just laughing at the broney mods.",241.8
"still brilliant even without the add ons! recommend to all!",99.8
"whilst it says i havent got much playtime i have racked up over 200 hours on my xbox and believe me, this is a great game. it is a bit hard to play with a keyboard and mouse because it was clearly designed from a controller. the storyline is awesome, the gameplay is awesome and it is a huge world. if you havent played this game then you have to now.",13.6
"elder scrolls v is the first game ive played in the series. it would be a fantastic game even if it wasnt already part of an amazing and innovative franchise. you start the game a prisoner in a wagon and the story unfolds from there. you can choose to do different things that may or may not affect how the rest of the game works out. by killing enemies and do certain things like picking locks, going on quest, swing your sword, shooting your bow you will earn exp. when you get a certain amount of exp you will be able to choose a skill to levelup in. skills like archy which increases power and accuracy with the bow., or one-handed swords which will increase the power of swords you swing with only one hand. the graphics and envirments are awesome! unfortunly my computer which im using to make this review cannt handle the awesome that is... skyrim.",43.7

"this is the best game ive ever played in my entire life.",258.1
"the best game ever, this game deserves a 10/10. no doubt at all its a free open world with different races and awesome skill tree. you can level up to 81 but there is a update system that works like a call of duty prestige system, as you -prestige- enemies become more difficulter. its just a fantastic and brilliant rpg game. spent like 190 hours or something like that on this game because its worth it. even the dlc does too! and there is steam workshop so you can download some awesome custom mods such as armours, weapons, house, npc and more!",405.4
"i recommend this its a medieval game set in the time where dragons controlled the land being revived by the notorious dragon known has alduin you play has a dragonborn born from a dragon spirit put into a nord,highelf,orc ect... body you created what your hero will be coming the class sets to racial features and your only job is to kill alduin the world destroyer 10/10 from me!",27.9
"sorry to say that, but skyrim isnt hard at all. the enemies on legendary are still behaving like you would use novice or something and the followers and the leveling up in game and get full hp thing makes it unbalanced. the shouts are too op, to. if you played tes4oblivion, then you know what is hard.",94.7
"the biggest open world single player game to date. have on ps3 and pc. all the dlc at a good price on pc make skyrim a no brainer.",78.2

(awesome music!favorite is when they go like, dovakhin, dovakhin, da da..... whatever...) i highly reccomend it! its totally worth your money! one of my favorite games! 9.5/10",57.8
"finally killed braith with the help of mods. 11/10 would buy again. but seriously, this game is one of the most immersive games to date. i have lost about four hundred hours to this game, as i first owned this game on the xbox 360. but i had so much fun with it, that i decided to buy it again on pc. not just because the pc version has mods, but because this game is genuinely fun. it was worth every dollar i spent on it.",237.2
"i wholeheartedly recommend skyrim. its one of my favourite games and its very easy to get stuck into the world. its been made with a lot of thought and effort put into not only the main quests, but even side quests. ill often stroll into a cave or tomb and be wrapped up in a whole other story. it truly is a masterpiece.",104.4

"you can throw vegie-tibles at guards and they talk about arrows in da kneeee",90.0
"skyrim is the perfect example of how a vast and addictive adventure game is done, without overloading the player with witcher-like  complexity. you begin the game picking only your race and from then, what type of fighter you are is completely built off of how you play, making for endless possibilities of the fighter you can become. it is a poor idea to just stick to the main story all throughout, because it will leave you at a disadvantage if you ignore the varying side quests and beautiful exploration, which allow you to uncover some of the best equipment as well as enhance your skills and levels. this in turn, has given me a massive playtime of 37 hours so far and the main story still only feels like its a quarter of the way through! this is a fantastic watercooler game, allowing for you and your friends to share hours of stories about your unique adventures and play style in skyrim. if you have the system specs and you love exploration, do not miss this game!",126.5
"infinite choices, outstanding main storyline, pretty cool graphics (amazing with enb and other free graphics enhancements), and the music, the muuuusic, man!!! it is beautiful, epic, magnificent, immersive and causes depression at the same time. i would buy this again a million  times. oh, and it is neverending, it has infinite quests = easily over 200 hours of gameplay! best game ever made.",441.6

"this game is relatively meh. theyve managed to dumb this series down to something that can bore me in a few hours. hint: only put points into the strength/health/carry weight/armor/toughness/everything stat. being a magician is worthless. every play through you should be a sneaky melee character that can use a bow. also enjoy fighting nothing but the same bear over and over.",94.3
"this game is addicting. i am picky and i love rpg games that have a midievil feel to them. what really gets me hooked it the ability to mod this. i can not only play the game, but i can build off of it for a truly custom experience to make it look and play how i want it to. it enables me to truly immerse myself in the game how i want to be immersed and enjoy the lore, storyline, and general gameplay. im not typically into one-player games, but this has to be my favorite now. the graphics are amazing, the lore is extensive, the gameplay (fighting, weapons, training, skills, skill tree) is easy enough to pick up but gets very complicated in higher levels which really makes you think about what youre doing. the mods are a pleasure, and with the nexus mod manager, easy to implement and manage, even if you have to rebuild your data install.",16.6

"deep world with an endless list of things to do. its a great exploration experience in which the non-planned found-by-mistake side-quests are usually the best. the only black spot is its combat. its too simple and repetitive, and you end up facing all confrontations with the same strategy and skills. if core combat was more polished and deep, it would be my game. when i got bored of the vanilla game, i started modding. i spent half of my playtime applying mods. and everything changed when i started using an enb, made the game look astonishlingly beautiful. totally recommended, specially with mods. modding database:",103.8

"without doubt tesv skyrim is one of the greatest fantasy rpgs ever made. the game itself is extremely well designed. some dungeons tend to feel repetitive but after hundreds of hours of play anything will. skyrim is one of the best supported games by a thriving modding community. when youe exhausted the 100+ hours of game play in the standard game (and its dlcs heartfire, dragonborn and dawnguard) then mod community will provide many many more hours of fun. that said i found the dawnguard expansion tedious in comparison to dragonborn and the original quests but thats only in comparison to the extremely high quality of that other content. the game does have a few bugs here and there but these can be easily cirucmvented with a little googling and patience. on the whole skyrim is 5/5 & probably the best game ive ever played",974.3

"does this game really need any introduction? the elder scrolls: skyrim is a beautiful game with a rich story, excellent characters and a huge dynamic open world for you to explore. if you havent played through this at least once, you are seriously missing out. my only major issue is this is clearly a game designed for consoles without pc in mind, the ui terrible with a mouse and keyboard, this is easily fixed through a mod called skyui however and truly doesnt take away from how mind-blowing and amazing the skyrim adventure is.",180.2

"one of the best rpgs i ever played and probably even will play. though gameplay progressed only a little bit from the elder scrolls iii: morrowind and graphics requirement may be a little bit too much, its still one of the most sophisticated, gorgerous and surprising games out there. conclusion: a true epos about brave men, beautiful women and legends about dragons, f#%* yeah! what else do you need? 5/5",2.7
"skyrim is a fairly overrated game the gameplay is nothing special and many if not all quests have you following an arrow on your minimap to the next encounter. combat feels floaty and quests arnt all that memoriable, the rpg elements are toned down compared to older elder scroll titles and seems overall a bit more casual. the big selling point for me was the ever increasing amount of mods avaliable, modding the game gives an completely welcomeing and different experiance depending on what you have installed once youve gone and put the time into figuring it all out. my rating - 6/10",60.6

"yet another great title from bethesda! the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a feat of its own. an immersive world, coupled with grand scenery and exploration, this game is a complete marvel. besides lightning, everything is at your fingertips in this game. customization, gameplay, graphics, exploration. it is almost impossible to spend less than 50+ hours in this game. a variety of quests, weapons, armour, spells, locations, and secrets, skyrim is a world you almost wish you lived in..besides the terrain dotted giants and ice-frosted trolls. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -gameplay 4/5 -customization 5/5 -graphics 5/5 -exploration 5/5 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- last but not least, the community. there are so many mods for this game it literally adds hundreds of hours on top of what youre most likely to spend playing the game itself. custom quests, dialogue, gameplay elements, weapons, armour, graphical tweaks, and fun mods make this game a 99/100 in my book. totally worth the full price, sale or no sale. get it, you will not regret.",86.9

"i love this game... i can easily get lost for hours doing the most trival thing such as organize supplies and attempting to decorate my home. i purchased this game when it was on sale over the summer and there is sat until recently i decided to play and i am truly impressed. i was once a very avid gamer, going back to the intellivision ;)... i always loved rpg and of course had played the first elder scrolls and loved it. i grew up when off to college and didnt game for over a decade... now i am back and have to say, at first i really didnt like this game, i mean i didnt specify my class... so much i was expecting was now gone, but in a good way... i could finally be a mage with skills of stealth and bow and arrow that would make the greatest thief blush. i played out my story the way i liked... i loved the city markarth and would focus on all the quests around that town. yeah there are some weird bugs and quirks, but overall the environment is so engrossing, you can easily spend hours on the game and not even realize it... the one thing that does somewhat bother me is the fact that its the same guy that does the voices for many of the male npcs and it can get annoying fast that they all have this same voice.",364.8

"havent really enjoyed morrowind, turned off oblivion after 5 minutes. played skyrim for 130hrs, i think thats enough said in case of is it good?. with mods this game turns from good to stunning. it never really ends, has cool first-person and really cool quests, but its not perfect. combat gets too easy after a while, dragons are bunch of c***s that never seem to land which is annoying when you just get set on fire and cant really do anything. a part from that, damn solid game, even beaten witcher 2 of which im a total fanboy.",170.5

"skyrim is a great game. you dont need me to tell you that though, its metacritic score is through the roof and im sure youve had at least one friend gushing about it. the reason skyrim is great isnt its amazing graphics or fantastic story. skyrim is great because it lets you play. so many games try to force you down linear corridors, and try to tell you who you are. skyrim lets you be who you want to be. want to be a criminal, wandering the wilderness and killing passers by? go for it! want to be a brilliant wizard set on saving the world from dragons? you can do that too. there are limits of course, but the elder scrolls has always done a great job drawing the line. not trying to do too much and making sure the game play is still solid, but catering to as many people as possible. ive been playing the elder scrolls series since the first in the series and theyve all been great, often ahead of their time. skyrim is the best to date, and the pinnacle of the open world game.",82.6

"what can i say about skyrim that hasnt already been said? if you own a pc and like video games you need to play skyrim, its just that simple. skyrim (and the previous elder scrolls games) are a large part of video gaming history. they created and perfected multiple genres of gaming that we see in many triple-a titles today. to be honest, if you consider yourself an intelligent gamer, you just dont know games unless you have played one of the elder scrolls titles. skyrim, or its predecessor oblivion, would be on anyones list of all-time best games. the storyline is complex and interesting; the world is huge and immersive; the combat is challenging, varied, and fun; and the amount of hours of fun that you can get out of this game is more than worth the full-price. if all of that wasnt enough, on the pc you can dowload literally hundreds of free mods that can completely change how it plays. you want to be a dragon-man? you can! you want to create your own spells? you can! do yourself a favor and buy this game!",198.8
"it is an awesome game and a must-have. the storyline is good, the graphics and the combat. there are many great points for buying this game but the developing of the different skills takes a little too long. that is a good point for liking it too. although that made me to slow and sadly didn t finish the game :( there are so many hidden things and to find them all will take a while but it s worth it ^^ --->go and check the trailer out they are so cool, too.",65.9

"its the first bethesda game that actually a piece of the cake. the game has amazing stories with good and bad missions and long gameplay! the graphics is ok (there are games that has way better graphics), awesome and easy system, huge open-world, which is somewhere good, somewhere boring or even be bad. recommended only for rpg fans. 9.5/10 :)",73.8

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim blew my mind when i played it for the first time. the world is massive, the water is prestine, and there is life everywhere you turn. wether it be a mushroom, a flower, or a magestic deer walking through the forest, the world feels alive and vibrant. there are so many things to do in this game it can be sometimes hard to chose what you want to try first. the crafting is fantastic - you can make your own armor, weapons, potions, or cook your own food... all using materials you collect throughout the world. creatures, monsters, and npcs are found in every environment, and nearly everything can be killed (except the children.. they cannot die... no matter how many times you whack them with a hammer...) you carve your own gameplay experience based on how you chose to play the game.. whether you become a blood sucking vampire and have to lurk about in the night, or if you become a werewolf prowling under the moonlight. the game constantly changes depending on the desicions you make, and that is very cool. also, there are dragons. who doesnt love dragons?",112.4
"what can i say about this game that has not already been said? this was my first elder scrolls game and i loved it so much that i went back and purchased oblivion and itend on purchasing daggerfell, too. dlc is worth getting, too, and with the legendary edition that came out recently, the dlc has become all but available. if you have ever fantasized about going on an adventure and immersing yourself in any sort of such experience, skyrim provides the ultimate form of escapism.",163.5
"i played plenty of this game and for nearly 600 hours on this account alone. its hightly worth it and its cheaper now then it was when i purchased it. mods are also a nice thingin having. plenty of graphics mods. 10/10 for this game.",609.1

"just... wow!!!! 10/10 ! this game is worth all the money!",172.4
"skyrim, is a medvial set rpg/action/adventure/badass game that focuses around your character also known as the dragonborn. this game has a long and awesome main-questline that brings you all around the providence of skyrim. takes you to the peaks of high hrothgar to meet the seclusive greybeards, and to the dank tunnels of old burial crypts and tombs. in addition to the main questline hundreds of hours of side quests including many very large ones (civil war, deadric quests), can keep you occupied for weeks. but thats not all! if you spend hundreds of hours playing the game and have destroyed every monster, explored every cave, theres one more thing you can add to expand the game infinitly. mods! there are thousands of mods on the steam workshop that can instantly expand your game in ways you couldnt even imagine, this game is not only huge as is with its 3 great dlcs, but can be even more expanded with mods! this is a must buy for any pc gamer!",213.2

"a really cool indie rpg. surprised no ones heard of it.",26.5
"what can you say about a game like skyrim, well first thing you can say is that its awesome, the second thing you can say is that while it does have plenty of bugs they arent game breaking for the most part, i completely support this game and reccomend people who have and have not played the previous titles to give it a go",91.6
"at one point i had three copies of this game, and no, i wouldnt play them simultaneously. now that skyrim development is wrapping up, its a good time to comment on the extremely enjoyable time i had with it, starting from character customization to random nonsense in the overworld. this game was able to reach a very diverse audience and i would regard it as the aaa minecraft even in terms of what you can do and how the player can add to the experience. with the workshop and mods still going strong, dont expect this game to ever be forgotten, but readapted for coming generations of gamers. until elder scrolls vi maybe...",62.4
"this game is near-perfect. there are only three issues i have with it: 1) there is the occasional bug; unofficial patch mods fix most of these. 2) after a few hundred hours, you might get bored. again, mods can remedy this. 3) its single-player only. it probably wouldnt work well as a mmo, but if they made a skyrim with a small multiplayer party system, it would probably be the best game of all time. if es:o was this game with private parties, id buy it in a heart beat and pay whatever amount theyd charge me per month. alas, for now i am satisfied with being immersed in my own little tamriel.",256.1
"this is one of the buggiest, most broken, most unfinished-feeling games i have seen in a long time. it would take a very special game to make me look past all the (really glaring) issues and still have fun, and skyrim is one of those games. it captures the feeling of adventure, of exploration, of excitement over the smallest things, more than most any games ive ever played. wouldnt call it a masterpiece, but its most definitely worth your time and money. (plus the game is extremely moddable, so youre getting a potentially limitless amount of playthroughs without it feeling stale, not even mentioning the entirely new games people have made with the engine. bumps up the value quite considerably, in my opinion.)",144.1
"i think this is one of the best game ever. so to you there not play, i will ask you one question why!",516.1
"this game is great! free world and the story line and the royal kingdoms and specially the dragons and the shouts of the dragons, ah man i just love it, you should purchase this game, becuase its one of a kind... but dont kill a chicken you will get arrested for that too :p .. jk, awesome game!",9.9
"i really really enjoy this game. i went into this thinking, oh , thats some really great art and i had no reason to think it could be better, then it exceeded those expectations too.",177.8
"skyrim is one of the best games ive played cause of players haveing the freedom to do whatever they want and they dont have to do the missions so skyrim is a sandbox open world game on my opinion so if your looking for killing dragons getting chased by guards and stealing from random guys this is a game you will like i highly reccomend this game.",125.3

"such a great, and huge game. if you were a fan of the elder scrolls 4, otherwise known as oblivion, then stop reading this review and buy the game now. along with an insane amount of content, you can also add mods with the pc version which adds even more hours of gameplay. this is why even though i have the game on 360, i picked it up for pc as well. do yourself a favor and give this game a try!",16.5
"bethesada does it again! another great addition to the elder scrolls family. these games allow you to create whatever kind of character you might desire.",128.8
"skyrim stands as the first new bethesda game with an entirely new engine. the creation engine generates fantastic visual splendor even on low performance computers, creating lush forest landscapes that intertwine with harsh and inhospitable winter tundras in the sacred homeland of the nord. fight unique monsters - in unique ways - using swords, shields, bows, spells, or a combination of each to take down foes that are always attempting to outwit - and outlast - you! skyrim utilizes a fantastic new dialog system which, in turn, reinforces the fantastic quest system we have come to know and love. dont like an element of how the game works? you can even change it with a devoted modding community always at the ready to provide fantastic new mods to an already overwhelming title. skyrim is huge, vibrant, life-like, and most of all, extremely fun. as an ardent fan of the elder scrolls frachise for over a decade, i would highly recommend this title to any diehard rpg fan or hack-and-slasher!",525.4

"i initially bought this on the console. that was dumb. this game is good on consoles, great on pc.",92.6
"i alredy own this on the 360 so dont be fooled by how much time i have played on steam. this game will eat up every bit of free time you have with its story telling, and the large amount of quests available. add in steam workshop support for easy access to more mods and addons than you can shake a stick at, this game will keep you busy for a long time to come.",214.9
"this might be the best game ive ever played in my life. better then every fps atleast. fpss gets boring after a while, but this game i could play for hours on end. though it might not say on my profile, i have atleast 300 hours. its almost like minecraft, you can play the original and like it. you can play however you want, but then you can add tons of mods which changes the game completely and makes it even better. graphic mods, armor mods, quest mods, cheat mods *cough cough* and expansion mods. and of course theres a lot of good dlcs.",26.4
"everyone already knows skyrim. the elder scrolls v is a great game. fun, easy to pick up and hard to put down. plenty of quests and dungeon crawling. able to dual wield and mix and match combat styles. my favorite game as of the end of 2013. skryim. own it. play it. love it!",399.8
"the elder scrolls games are all masterpieces in their own right, but skyrim is truly the crowning glory of this series. from the details given to each race and the extremely custumizable factor from character creation to even your own varied playstyle, skyrim allows you to be exactly who you wish while immersing you in a wildly beautiful land full of adventure and oppportunity. let wanderlust take hold and your instincts guide you through battles with fierce dragons and bands of armed bandits. this game is so feature rich that its difficult to summarize in a short review. its best that anyone who hasnt done so yet just go for it. you will not be disappointed.",13.6
"well we waited so long for this game, and if you do not look at the fact that is a sequal to oblivion then it is a good game, buggy as hell and not even close in terms of graphics and gameplay to what it could or should have been. but all in all a good game, however if you consider the fact this is the sequal to the most successful rpg game ever, then epic fail bethesda quite posible that this is the weakest offering they could have knocked together, but just look at other recent games from bethsda (hunted demons forge, rage, brink), maybe bethesda should fire the current team and try again. a classic example of the turgid backwash developers puke on us pc gamers while  all the little kids with consoles, who think these games are epic? oh low i long for the glory days , when all game dev was done for pc and the dumbed down the game for consoles, or just did not bother with them at all. ok rant over.......buy it or boycott it up to you..",168.4

"skyrim is a open-world rpgesk game. the graphics of the game are now out-of-date and the combat system is too easy for hardcore gamers. the story is bad, the factinos are plain and their quests are basicly this: oh you know our best infiltrator couldnt get it! lets send this new recruit! or go kill these bunch of targets because we wannt to just sit around in our hideout and fap etc. the soundtrack is good but it gets boring after 100+ hours. all of this can be fixed with mods (not the story of factions and main tho) i installed the requiem mod and the combat/skill system was overhauld to perfection! dlc like storymods are also out there with my personal favrout: falskar. purchase at your own will",210.1

"simply one of those great open world games you can find around, vanille game is already great if you skip the main quest and wander around or slaughter everything in your path, you simply would have fun for over 200+ hours on 1 save game... and thats just the vanille game, skyrim is one of those games you can mod into a even greater game making it even more challaging and harsh then it would but you can make it as easy as drinking water... eitherway both ways are great its just how you play the game!",778.4

"has its drawbacks currently, like a 1st service pack version of windows xp, but nothing that cant be modded in and out of the game. most of the issues have been fixed with the 1.4 patch, and several more are being/ have been fixed by independant modders. best game since oblivion, and mgs4. and a few more best games of all time... but right amongst them is skyrim. i recommend using an xbox 360 controller, for walk/run speed control and overall immersibility. keyboard/mouse are for online games, just my opinion. im rambling... buy this game, i have hundreds of hours in already, and with new mods becoming available, hopefully hundreds of hours more content to come. worth even the full price, if you miss the sales.",212.9
"this is my first foray into the elder scrolls series, though i bought oblivion and morrowind and will get around to exploring those eventually. i played a little of morrowind but not enough to form an opinion yet (so far its neato!). its one of the most beautiful games ive ever played and the music is gorgeous and haunting. ive sunk many hours into this game but i still havent completed the main questline. ill get around to it eventually, but theres so much to do and see that it doesnt matter. im thinking i should increase the difficulty a bit. its easy to cheese everything if you choose blacksmithing, enchanting, and alchemy. the combat overall could be better. however, there are many, many mods that fix the games flaws and add all sorts of wonderful things. do you want to add more immersion? well, there are survival mods that affect the food you eat, how deeply the cold influences your behavior, and how you attack. if you dont like something, get a mod that changes it! if you need a desert island game this one is it due to its endless replay value.",327.3

"this game is very action packed and with quality graphics there are many places to explore and conquer.but on a not very beefy pc it is dissapointing in a number of ways 1: there are a amount of glithes and lag 2: you dont get the full exprience like on playstation or xbox 3:it is quite small and less realistic. but this game has its ups also, skyrim is an all time great with thrills and adventures around evry corner. i would rate this game 8 i would rather play it on xbox or playstation.",200.3

"i absolutely love this game. i have spent many hours playing it on the xbox360 and ended up buying it again on the pc so i could start trying all the interesting mods and hd rendering. this is a game that you can play over and over again and each time you play through it, it is an entirely different experience. only downside i can think of is there are a few questlines where you have an option to go one way or the other (i wont go into details to avoid spoilers) any one side is really well developed and interesting and the other falls short. there are only a couple of them where this applies though.",10.6

"if you dont mind a little tinkering, this game can be one of your all-time favourite purchases. any elder scrolls game wouldnt be complete without a massive modding community, helping you to twist the game to any of your fancies. want to make the game better looking? mods. want to have more realistic in-depth lore while you explore the land? mods. want to bash your enemies with a captain america shield and a squeaky toy while using a dragon shout to call forth thomas the tank engine? mods. no seriously, there are mods for that last one.",197.5
"this game is absolutely amazing. the way you can tell a good game from a bad game, is a good game will keep you up until you see the sun through youre windows. on many occasions did this happen. bethesda makes some really awesome games and skyrim is definetly one of them. there is so many things you can explore. in fact i think the map of skyrim is so amazing, that if there werent that many quests, there would still be so much interesting places to go. in my conclusion - skyrim is one of the best games of all time. i put it next to morrowind.",70.5
"in 2014, it is quite obvious that skyrim is a great game, and also a game you have to test/play if youre interested in rpgs. so i wanted to write a critic a little deeper than wow, great game. despite his high qualities, i think that skyrim is also poorer than morrowind regarding gameplay, because it was adapted for xbox and ps, and the gameplay of morrowind was able to be deeper because it was on computer. anyway, the story and quests are as great as they were in morrowind, but i think they are easier, especially because of the map marker. in morrowind, to locate a moutain, or a donjon was sometimes uneasy, because you had to ask people if they knew it, but in skyrim, i feel the developpers show you well, you have to go there, and after do this, so i feel less freedom than morrowind to find places. graphically, skyrim is really beautiful, and the characters too - it was not in morrowind or oblivion. landscapes were handsome, but characters, without mods... i really appreciate that skyrim is really in the storylines of the elder scrolls - indeed fan players could find in the game many references to the other games. a pleasure to play.",110.8

"i got this on xbox 360 before i joined the pc master race. the first thing i bought as soon as i got my pc was this game. i knew i had to try all the mods. the mods for this game are awesome, they are ranging from enb to sex. i got to say the sex mods are wonderful. will definitely stroke the sausage again tonight. now dont get me wrong, the vanilla game is awesome but without the mods to make the women perfectly shaped, and well equiped while wearing skimpy outfits, and having the sex mods, vanilla just doesnt have the same zing to it.",132.8
"anyone who has put a negitive review simply has no brain. great game with so much potential. love it to death, along side the fallout series.",89.9
"would love this game a whole awful lot more if my computer could run it correctly. then again, thats what i get for using a nvidia graphic card with mods installed. i played this game extensively on xbox 360, and had a lot of fun. its just that, i wish this game could have multiplayer options, not massive multiplayer, but maybe up to four people. still, if you want to waste 800 hours of your life, this is your next best option.",0.8

"after 50+ hours in skyrim i can say that this game is huge and amazing. it has some glitches here and there but you have to take it as a whole, and the game is massive. there will be few times, that you might lost interest in the story, but remember, the story is what you make it. and if you dont like this way, go and do whatever you want. that is the beauty of skyrim.",83.3

"im like years behind the skyrim craze but this game is chill.",241.4
"skyrim is a masterpiece - period. its also long and im not exaggerating. the numerous amount of side quests can have you exploring forever and a day, as its meant to. the game is designed to be enjoyed, not to be rushed through. you are meant to go explore in this vast world, interact with the numerous characters that you encounter, be fulfilled in combat and feel like the dragonborn you are meant to become. the main storyline is fantastic and is well worth the journey. all the other stories along the way are just magical... a never-ending fable that urges you to keep going. everything in skyrim is just stunning. i seriously have so many screenshots of so many amazing views. i feel like a part of me plays just for the game photography and that isnt an exaggeration in the slightest. the music composed by jeremy soule is just an epic masterpiece.",326.3

"oh skyrim, with your wondrous landscapes and your lovely wildlife and inhabitants. skyrim is an excellent game with so much to do. become a thief, a warrior, anything you wanna be. you can do all the quests you want or go around each town and slaughter everyone. the possibilities are (relatively) endless. my only qualm about the game is the menu system in-game. it seems a little clunky at times and annoying having to scroll through heaps of items sometimes just to get one thing. luckily there are mods out there for that, and i definitely recommend them should you feel the same way",31.1

"without question an inferior game to dark souls... but still fun and addictive in its own way. the main draw, for me, was the aspect of exploration. the world of skyrim is huge. bigger than any video game world ive ever played before. so many places to go, towns and cities to visit, people to meet and talk to... i love exploration and discovery... so skyrim kept me coming back for more, again and again, since there is always more to explore. the gameplay is... adequate. the combat is kind of garbage (especially compared to dark souls)... but you get used to it, and its not so bad after a while. i preferred 3rd person mode (but i always do). its nice to actually see the pretty armor you found, which you dont get to do in 1st person mode. the most recent dlc - dragonborn - was the best of all the dlc, since it added an entirely new island map completely separate from the original map, and a ton of new quests/content/etc. the whole package (vanilla game + all dlc) is currently on sale (as of today anyway - june 16, 2013). id recommend getting it for cheap while you can.",328.2
"this game is truely immersive, i have over 100 hours on record and i think that none of those hours have had me bored. skyrim can throw up new things even after i have played 100+ hours. i have only done the main quest line once, but i have created new characters countless times. i enjoy this game immensely. the modding community is still very active and i think thats another way of making this game so much more enjoyable. skyrim comes with the creation kit to make anything you want within the game. it took me an hour or so to get the basic knowledge on how to use it and so on, but youtube is filled with very helpful tutorials. i havent downloaded any dlc and the game is still great, bethesda has done the dlc in the correct way as the game isnt lacking in any way so you dont feel like you need the dlc to complete the game. five word summary: immensely immersive, bundles of fun.",192.2

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",248.6

"your kids kids will be playing this game or another version. the only thing to stop this game is the company itsself. i would rank this game series up there with civ5. i will say sims and sim city series also. when you come across a good game it just stays with you. this game is wide open. never are you made to go to point and and talk to ted and go kill 10 of this and pick 10 of this plant. you have a main quest then you have a civil war and then you have a wide open world with people to help and deep dark dungeons forts castles and numerous other places to explore. with the hearthfire add on you can even build your own house and adopt children if thats what you want to do. go slay a dragon and come home and have dinner with the wife and kids. that is unmodded skyrim. go on the workshop or nexus and you can spend days looking at mods to do just about anything you want to do. the elder scrolls modding world is one of the most open and friendly mod communites you will ever find. if you want a fantasy rpg where you decide where to go or what to do then this is the game for you. i hope you enjoy it just as much as i have and still do.",766.8

"amazing game where you can do so much, adventure the whole of skyrim and slay all the monsters! or maybe become a master mammoth hunter and slay the giants too! or even fight against the executioners by joining the stormcloak army! also the soundtrack it fits so well with the game and it literally makes you feel there, i dont know to explain it, at some points the atmospheric soundtrack is just magical....",63.3
"pretty much the best game of all time, 11/10 would reccomend",133.0
"you know what this is game about, i dont really need to write this review other than to tell you too get a few mods that increase visuals, trust me do it!",84.8
"skyrim is a great game. it has the adventuring/war game mixed with a mystery kind of game. and if you are really into just graphics or the first person house kind of games, skyrim is the game for you. when i play it, it is awesome. i personally like the dlc. (downloadable content) this dlc includes new worlds, new weapons and more fun. and in some places of skyrim, you can see hardships or joy in just people around you. so if any of these interest you, skyrim is the perfect game for anyone.",97.8
"great game, even if you finish the main questline you may still have the logbook full of sidequests for you to do. skyrim always has something for you to do.",90.3
"skyrim is amazing in every sense, this game is undoubtely the best game of the year 2011 and one of the best games i have ever played in my hole life.the only problem are the terrible bugs.",287.3
"an amzing, breathtaking game that most of you probably already know about. if you love video games and still havent played this, do yourself a favor and buy it now.",11.1
"i was first introduced to the elder scrolls series with daggerfall. loved it then, thought it was one of the best things to grace a pc, and my mind was blown when morrowind was released. oblivion was just a plesant continuation of things, and finally, skyrim.. ah skyrim. only one word comes to my mind for skyrim: epic. everything about it just feels epic, i cant think of a better way to say it. fans of the elder scrolls will adore it, and anyone being introduced to the series this way... well... theyll like it i think. i think theyll like it alot. =)",383.9
"this game is one of the best rpgs of all time. i logged over 200 hours on the xbox 360 version and rebought it play on pc. there is an almost infinite amount of things you can do in this game. 9.8/10 almost perfect.",40.3
"it is not often i get lost in a game like i did with skyrim. everything about this game screams quality and adventure. while bethesda hasnt exactly got a track record for delivering bug-free games at launch, this has been a pleasant, polished and amazing experience so far. a much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system thats amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do. truly a masterpiece.",21.0
"story- 8/10 graphics- 9/10 combat- 7/10 fun factor- 10/10(with and without mods) overall- 9.5/10 i do still prefer the fallout series over the elder scrolls. due to fallout just being more fun with vats and a more engaging storyline and world in my opinion, but seriously, skyrim is one of the best. now bring on fallout 4 already!!! *disregard my steam hours, played hundreds of hours on console.",1.8
"this is one of the best games i have ever played in my whole life, it never, ever ends, so much too do, every person you talk to ingame will have something interesting too say or for you to do, a huge world to explore thousends of quests to complete caves too explore and anthing else, i highly recommend this masterpeice to anyone who can afford it.",353.0
"one of the best games for any moderately new system. while very few tasks change anything about the world you are in, the voice acting and optional depth of lore is still immersive. the amount of quests and personalities can keep you occupied for a rediculous amount of time.",291.3
"conclusion on why this game is worth buying: 1. delicious sweetrolls. 2. space program with the giants. 3. cabbages. 4. hide and seek with the dead. 5. chicken. 6. physics-defying horses. 7. have i mentioned cabbages? 8. fresh products in ancient caves/dungeons. 9. totally-not-annoying immortal children. 10. mmmm skooma mmmmm 11. fus ro dah!!",186.3

"a brillant game its worth more 9.99 love it but the tes 4 is better in my opinion and nothing more than opinion",22.8
"great game, thinking about buying the elder scrolls online, but dont wanna pay monthly though...",2.5
"apart from the occasional crash to desktop and a few quest bugs i encounted, one of which was locked out preventing me from buying a house, this game is outright amazing and sets the tone for all rpgs of this generation. the amount of things you can do is truly staggering. the stories for each faction are thought out well, the combat is improved greatly from oblivion, and the graphics are amazing. definately should pick this up.",711.6
"with almost 200 hours on this game i can safely say that the base game is great. throw in the mods, you just entered a whole new world with endless possibilities.",203.7
"possibly the greatest open world roleplaying game ever created. beautiful atmosphere and brilliant design. definitely something worth buying! 10/10",203.0
"one of the best games ever made. tons of exploration and infinite quests. fight everything from butterflies to angry undead skeleton dragons. got it when it first came out and still play it to this day.",639.3
"this is 2014 people! why the hell do you not have skyrim yet? buy it now!",67.1
"in my opinion, bethesda did so well with this game! - interesting combat, suiting any playstyle, whether stealthy, charging in headfirst, casting a spell, anything! - variety of enemies, usually something new to kill every adventure! - dlcs are so worth the legendary edition! - allows you to change difficulty, which is really nice for the newcomer and seasoned elder scrolls veteran alike! - modable, which makes everything better! - more-or-less recent patchs have made it so you can prestige skill trees (aka: making them legendary), so you really dont have to stop leveling the skill trees you love! - good variety of weapons and enchantments, making for some interesting combos, like a bow that can sap health, a dagger that can steal mana, swords that do big damage at night, and more! - much more than i can list, but an 11/10 from me! get this game if you want a magical (literally!) experience with fantasy!",226.2
"among the best, most-complete gaming experiences i have encountered ever, let alone from bethesda (who have a reputation for releasing incomplete material). combined with the steam workshop and the other modding communities on the web, skyrim is still a powerhouse years after its initial release.",396.1
"this game is just awesome.i never really like this game more than oblivion.but then i try a mod and then another one and it became a really,really good game.9/10 cause that game is really better if its moded.",21.5

"skyrim... an awesome game with many choices...no need to redo your character if you are fed up with beeing an archer...just start swinging a twohander and soon you will be as good. great stuff!",134.4
"what can you say about skyrim that hasnt been said? it is a rich, immersive, deep, time consuming and thoroughly satisfying simulator for demi-god life; and thats just the vanilla game. this is one of my all time favorite games and i cannot praise it enough, as it has kept me occupied for thousands of hours on consol and now pc. an easy to use perk and crafting system and easy to learn combat mechanics make it accessible to most levels of gamer, and to the devout there is a stupid amount of lore to explore and easter eggs to find. the 3 official dlcs are highly recommended, as they compliment and expand the vanilla game quite well. the cherry on top though is the very active mod community, and i would suggest to anyone buying this game to check out the steam workshop or nexus mods, as they exponentially increase the quality and length of the game. i love it, so much ive bought it twice, and i consider it a perfect marriage of old and new styles of rpg.",306.4
"i buyd this game 3 years ago and i still find it awesome!!",131.5
"game of the year. best game of this decade so far.",107.4
"mine is not working. every time i start on the menu that say continue, load, new game,etc. please try to fix the problem. i was able to play for a little over a month before on day it started loading and it went back to the steam home page. it still does this when it allows me to get on.",473.3

"facestabbed a bandit in the face and he flew 10/10",127.8
"i would personally rank this as my favourite open world game above all others. skyrim offers possibly the most immersive world in gaming at the moment; along with an array of stories and quests. these are not boring and dull rehashes of a set quest type - each mission you come across will present a unique story and list of objectives to complete. make sure you dont read the wiki for stories of each quest because youll ruin it. lets just say that one of the quests involve you meeting a lost dog that turns out to be an evil gods spirit companion.",293.8
"this is the best game i have ever played it has astonishing graphics for an rpg and its a never ending free roam adventure",234.7
"this game is one of the best rpg games ever! the story itself is quite lackluster (main only) but the things that follow from the story after its done is extremely interesting. i myself do not have the strongest pc a mediocore pc i might say. the game runs at around 40 fps at ultra and its not needed to run at a high fps since its a rpg. this game right not is on a mega sale so get it definetly if youre looking for an excellent rpg, many interesting stories and it runs well on lower pcs. 10/10",86.9
"this is by far one of the best games i have ever played the game is so well thought out, and with so many quests and dungeons and dragons to do and fight, you will have many, many hours of fun and enjoyment when playing this game. and with all of the mods and with the two dlcs installed too, there is even more enjoyment to be had if you are someone who likes to immerse yourself in your game(s) then this is definatley for you",159.4

"even though this game is now three years old, this game is still fantastic. so many different choices to pick from just from the vanilla skyrim. browse the steam workshop and get so much more out of this game. browse any modding site for skyrim and the possiblities are endless. this is an absolute must have for those who love rpgs.",293.9

"ive played about 70 hours now and im probably less then 1/4 of the way through the game. this is one of the best games i have ever played, and i was never a fan of the other elder scrolls. i have had multiple boss fights that have took me upwards to 15 to 20 even possibly 30 minutes, and i never felt frustrated but i did feel challenged. this is one game that a 60 dollar price tag is actually under-priced.",417.1

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"worst game ever. it has windows 95 graphics and there is so few stuff to do. actually its like one or two towns and thats it. really a ripoff. the dragons totally scare me and one killed me. not to mention you do not even have a machinegun or a laser weapon. then those dragons would not be a problem! also, on youtube, they do scream some gibberish and then the enemy flies away. well, i screamed for half an hour at my screen. nothing happened. i thought this was interactual gaming or so?",413.1
"skyrim is easy. easier than the other elder scrolls games. its my second favorite after morrowind. really, the only critique i can make is that i wish skyrim itself was more interesting. the country is alright as far as elder scrolls locations go, and lends itself to fun adventures. i mean, this game is really one big adventure simulator. but even with mods it fails to really capture my imagination, but i know thats wholly just me. for most other people its pretty rad and so more power to them. but yeah, buy the game.",261.0

"skyrim is everyting a lover of the elder scrolls saga wants and more. a beautiful (botf graphic as with story as with gameplay) freeroam rpg. the game has many variations in things you can collect, discover and mod on the game. i think this game raises the expectations for the freeroam rpg games on launch and long after. there is a catch however. this game was fun while it lasted, but it didnt convince me to come back and finish what i started. 80hrs+ and still i didnt beat the game because i wanted it to last, but being able to that kind of long run did turn me off in the end.",95.0

"this is my favourite game of all time. i have so many great memories of this game, questing, roleplaying, killing, it was such a great experience. i love the landscape in this game also, there is so much variety it should make everyone happy. environments such as the harsh cold mountains of the north, the beautiful forests and flora of whiterun and falkreath, the amber trees and golden grass of riften. and the rocky, dwemer feel to markarth. playing through the vanilla game was one of my favorite and greatest experience ever. and then i started modding. wow. the modding support for this game is both ridiculous and amazing at the same time. there are mods out there for absolutely everyone. whether your a hardcore survivalist ( frostfall, rnad), or roleplaying a hunter (hunterborn, a hunting guild) or maybe your a fearless brute, a mercenary, this game is perfect. if you are not a fan of the 2011 graphics, do not worry there are several enbs out there which vastly improve the look of this game. my favorites are: realvision enb, seasons of skyrim enb and project enb. all look absolutely stunning. honestly, i could write a thousand word essay on why you should buy this game or why its my favourite game of all time. to anyone wanting one of the best gaming experiences out there, i recommend this game. its perfect.",753.8
"switch back and forth between this and oblivion, depending on which game ive modded into ctd hell. skyrim is a little touchy on mouse movement, which makes combat a little frustrating at harder levels. i usually mod up some decent armor to compensate. i really enjoy the collecting, crafting, and other mundane tasks that come with the game. gives something to do besides blasting around the map wreaking havoc. the number of available mods bring a quality of infinity to the game. just keep switching out mods, difficulty levels, and you can have something new each time out.",605.6

"a game isnt great just because of good graphic or good story, but because it is crafted is such a way that it can run great in medium pc and yet run superb in harcore pc. i have seen many large filed games with so-so graphic quality, while this game doesnt have that much, yet runs much greater than those games. one of original rpg, where it is all about you, you are an adventurer in skyrim, it is up to you how you journeyed throughout this world and slay undeads, beasts, monsters & dragons. this game is designed for mature players and be warned, very addictive",192.2

"well. it doesnt get much more thu-umingly good than this. skyrim in pc is a waterfall of fun - the game itself boasts a 94 in the metascore, and theres so damn much to be getting on with in skyrim! the atmospheric views and daunting enemies make this game cash-worthy, and the ability so shout - rather loudly - as a dragon can is pretty unique, and brings skyrim to the table as a worthy rpg contender. graphics? theyre a little demanding, but the ultra settings are a different story - bringing the best graphics to an rpg ive ever seen. such a good game - especially with mods. brilliant. buy it. be the dragonborn.",443.9

"its a good open world sandbox game that goes with the rest of the elder scrolls lore.",103.0
"this game is great, but has its drawbacks. it feels more like an adventure game than an rpg, its more about doing than filling out level sheets. which i must say i prefer. i found it tedious in oblivion to allocate skills into things i ended up not using because i didnt know the plot of the game the first time. it didnt feel like i was playing a game, it felt like homework. skyrim is simplier, but its streamlined nature is what makes it so enjoyable to play. i feel like im going on an adventure, and getting stronger using skills that come natural to me. the characters look pretty, and the open world is really quite astounding. i found myself simply looking at the scenery, knowing that someone had to envision it. it is probably one of my favorite games, but i dont like to compare it to the other elder scrolls games, because it breaks the mold with a new leveling system.",74.7
"this game is amazing one of the best games i will ever play in my entire life, infact i love it so much i bought it on xbox and pc i have no regrets about it no matter what people say i can mod it on one and if i balls it up (most likely) i have another copy for xbox!. but heres the trouble.... this game doesnt deserve to be rated 10/10 its such a crap score... we need 999999999999999999999/10 for this game!",1.5

"this game is in depth and has so much lore and hidden details going into it.... other than the lore and the in depthness it also has brilliant gameplay and role playing elements to it e.g if you dont want to fight dragons in brilliant battles to the depth you can get level 100 blacksmithing without entering whiterun (i dont suggest that)... im mainly doing this for a badge so bye",48.4
"its skyrim, and on steam, you have access to workshop. i bought this game twice (ps3). never regretted it once. its amazing.",142.6
"great game with a huge world to discover. you can tell that its related to fallout 3 and fallout new vegas, so if you liked those you might like this as well. i prefer the post apocalyptic future fallout universe, but for a fantasy world this game is quite well done. i can tell, because i like it even though i usually dont like fantasy scenarios with dragons etc. at all. it seems to still have some stability problems, though - at least on my windows 8.1 with a radeon graphics card and intel processor. if i put the setting for shadows to ultra, my frame rate is still alright (amds gaming evolved even suggests these settings), but the game crashes to the desktop almost immediately. took me a while to figure out what was causing it, because on the internet people seem to have found some more things that apparently can cause this game to crash to the desktop (without any error message) as well. i already had similar problems with fallout, so i hope bethesda is going to consider stability more in the development of fallout 4. anyways, you might also want to get the official hd texture pack here on steam for free (if not even the countless unofficial graphics mods), because many textures are not very nice to look at.",14.3
"this game is very addictive and amazing so if you are prepared to abandon your social life, i recommend playing this game",138.9
"probably should have reviewed this when i first got it and only left my computer for beverages - which was rarely. when you first start it is an amazing vast expanse of free roam and thihngs to do at every corner. as well as this there is a good skill system in which with every level up you can choose you become more proficient at certain things- attaining certain perks for different combat or miscellanious skills. the combat is fun with a bit of customisability due to different perks and weapon types, however it is quite standard hacky-slashy, though fun hacky-slashy at that. its worth noting that to make the most of this game you should probably invest in a dlc or two, namely dawnguard, or dragonborn. after a few hundred hours of playtime you may feel yourself weary of the game, maybe feeling repetative at times. maybe ill go into more depth at other times, though anything i wanted to say other reviews have probably covered. all i have to say is if you havent heard of this game, youre missing out. play morrowind and oblivion while youre at it. 9/10 imo.",369.6
"i recommend this for gamers who like: open world or rpgs. issues: the only issues i had were maybe the graphics which i fixxed through mods. other than that, i dont have any issues with the game. story: you are the dragonborn who ends up getting caught by the imperials. you later arrive in helgen about to get your head chopped along with the fellow stormcloaks who also got caught along with a horse thief. just before you get your head chopped off, a dragon attacks helgen. as you try to escape you can go with either ralof(a stormcloak rebel) or hadvar(an imperial soldier). afterwards you can do almost whatever you want, thats what i like about open world games. you can continue through the main quest or do side quests. either way, in the end you kill alduin(the final dragon). note: i chose the stormcloaks side and havent had the time to go through the imperials side of the story yet. therefore i cant add-on to the story very well when i leave out the imperials side of it. if you have any questions, ask me and ill answer them as best as i can.",311.5

"this game seems like the best game ever for a day, week, month, or even a year or two, and then gets boring for a while. skyrim is kind of like life, sometimes it is fast-paced and so many things are happening, and sometimes its just slow, calm, and quiet, which is what this game is trying to accomplish. this game is not perfect, however. there are bugs, glitches, and the fact that it runs slowly sometimes if you dont have the most up-to-date computer (which is what my situation happens to be). some of these bugs can be easily fixed with mods or console commands. this game is great nevertheless, and the fact that so many people are still playing it even when the next game in the series (the elder scrolls online) is out now, shows how great this game is. what makes this game even better is the amount of dlc and mods that the community has made to expand on the game itself. skyrim is a great way to take a break from life, because its amazing immersion can make you forget completely about your problems happening in the real world. i give skyrim a 9.25/10",508.1

"being a console gamer for so long i have been a huge fan of the elder scrolls since morrowind playing these games for years it is a game that can easily be lost in. the music, combat, open ended sandbox non linear gameplay, exploring at your own hearts content, even creating things from weapons, armor, magic, becoming a warewolf or vampire, being infected with a disease all aspects of this game makes it one of my favs. upon becoming a first time real pc gamer biulding my high end over clocked pc and setting every graphical and textures to high/ultra and seeing the differences between the consoles and the pc made for an entirely new gaming experiance alone!",30.3

"very great game, well made. does randomly crash sometimes and you can get stuck sometimes, literally, not as in you dont know the story but in you are trapped between some rocks and a wall. totes worth, you will end up having conversations about this game with anybody who has ever played it.",77.1
"everytime i think im done with this game i figure something else to do, or another style to play with. skyrim is by far one of the best open world games to date, with player-made content constantly updating you will never run out of things to do.",178.2

"only get if you have a grapghics card! my old computer couldnt take it. now that the warnings over with. i had this game for the xbox 360 where i downloaded all the dlcs. now i have it on computer with dlcs and now mods from the steamworkshop! the game itself is brilliant. free roaming, always something to do and the mods some people have put up are fantastic. i mean, star wars was set a long time ago and skyrim does look far far away...",51.6

"the ultimate open-world rpg with many hours of gameplay. it features highly detailed characters and realistic interactions, extensive skill tree and levelling system, carefully crafted quests with good balance between combat skills and wits; the dynamic world features amazing details of nature and the built environment. a must buy if you have enjoyed previous elder scrolls titles; and a good buy if you are looking to get started in this series. the new legendary edition looks like a great buy because of the legendary difficulty and the additional option to do mounted combat and master all skills, being unavailable otherwise. however, full appreciation of the game requires computer with fairly good specs and a decent monitor. as per elder scrolls games, there are lots of glitches and bugs in the early stages of the game; although most have been fixed since, some still remain. but overall, being a game of the year is still an understatement.",182.9

"honestly i have to say this is one of the best games i have ever played in my whole entire life . i own it on xbox 360 and i loved it so much i had to buy it on steam. if you buy this game and you have an xbox or a ps3 i would recommend buying it on steam because you can download mods and fun  like that.",40.2
"the ultimate open world role playing game. never have i immersed myself in a world such as in skyrim. you play a... thing, one of several races, and you have to do... something. but you get to wear armour abnd upgrade it, and do magic and sneak and shout at things and get to fight dragons!! yes, there is a story in there somewhere, but saving tamriel from the return of the immortal alduin by means of time manipulation somehow dissapeared to the background as you spent your time pickpocketing, mining and installing mods. ah yes, the mods. this was the biggest factor that garunteed replayability (or at least extended the original playtime). because the code was made available for modders, gamers and programmers could craft their own addons and make it available for other players. now you could have your character run around looking like mario if you want. while there is a central storyline, youll probably try at least to finish at least one the faction storylines, the thrief and assassin guilds probably being the most enjoyable. but then there are hundreds of side missions that will keep you away from your loved ones for months and have them doubt whether you were even there to begin with.",944.7

"on the record i got the elder scrolls skyrim in the anthology pack thats why its on my pc most of my hours are on the console . as much as i loved the elder scrolls series this game just felt like it lost the true felling of the elder scrolls and was a victim of the hype ,most people will disagree with me because they started with skyrim and didnt experience the others but skyrim is more of a action game than an rpg, most of the main rpg components have been dumbed down for more casual gamers,nothing against people who dont have hours to play a game and will like to jump in and out at a moment,true elder scrolls fans enjoy the rpg managing of skills and attributes but skyrim just doesnt have that.without the class system you can jump from a warrior to a mage and be oped in 30 mins it eliminates the fun of starting over and experiencing the game in a different way.personally morrowind was the best elder scrolls game because it was a true rpg some people think its nostalgia but i am 18 and still agree that it is because it works for what it is. i personally do not recommend skyrim but if you enjoy action game with slight rpg elements buy it but dont expect a true elder scrolls rpg.i played through it once and enjoyed certain parts but it just got so repetitive without the quest design from morrowind and the wacky characters of oblivion.",11.0
"all i have to say is ; 366 hours played and im still not bored.",519.8
"finally bought this. holy hell the number of hours you can burn in this amazing game is incredible! buy it full priced or get it on sale and buy the dlcs, this game has to be in your library! i have friends on over 100 hours play time and still loving it!",29.7
"this game, guys. for anyone who, in younger years, obsessed over elder scrolls while the rest of the world wondered what the hell was wrong with them, this game represents a cure. few heard of morrowind in my hometown. none had beaten it. three or four classmates knew of oblivion, and only two got past the battle of kvatch. i honestly thought no one else could obsess over the series the way i had. then came skyrim. it wasnt morrowind or oblivion. it didnt need to be. skyrim gave me more than gameplay, more than caves and barrows. it showed me there were others just as obsessed, just as excited to see the secrets hidden in the next ruin, the next chest, the next mission. forget graphics. forget story. forget immersion. skyrim is perfect because it showed me i wasnt alone. beyond that, i can say nothing higher.",28.9

"gamer! what is best in life? to be a nord, slay the dragons, and to shout at your enemies until they die! yes, that is good! that is good.",734.3
"its skyrim. its an elder scrolls game (before they destroyed the name with eso *shudder*). if you like your role-play real and live wake up with a new story daily this is the game for you. the best part for me isnt the main story at all (although that is great) its just walking the land, experiencing new things all the time. i havent found half of what this game has in it, just because i spend most of my time wandering around, reacting to random encounters. :> this is a game you can stop playing for months, go back to, and pick right up again. and god knows i have...many, many times. buy it.",583.6
"this game is very addictive and will take away your life.... social life. dont buy this game if you care about people because you will never see them again.",213.9
"played this game on my 360 and a lil less than 400hrs. i did everything and i still wanted to play it but just couldnt. so now that im away and cant rightly use an xbox, i now have it for pc. i am having even more fun now. i loved skyrim the second i first started playing. oblivion was awesome but skyrim took my brain and smashed it through the back of my skull.",56.4
"skyrim is one of my favorite games of this generation. oblivion was an amazing game in almost every way, and skrim, the next game in the series, surpasses it. from the very beginning the story puts you right in the middle of an awesome adventure, which you can choose to delve into right then and there, or go off and do your own thing. the interface is slick and easy to use, the level up system is simple but effective, and the skill trees are varied creating many different play styles. i strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes action rpgs or adventure games. so much to do in this game.",40.8

"playing this game on pc, xpotatoe and ps3 and im still not even tired this game! i probably have over 500 hours over the three and by far the pc is superior due to the fact that mods make the most of game 10/10.",66.1
"if any game can engulf and captivate your attention until the realization that youve travelled time, this is it. the land of skyrim caters to all types of rpg adventurers through its rich living world, where things to do are always in abundance. whether youre the loot fiend, deadly thief, master craftsman, wayward traveler, or just plain slayer of all things, skyrim lets you do all that; at your own pace and leisure. you just cant help but be immersed and drawn in - as the game engages you in more adventure and promise of reward - at every turn. this is the first and only elder scrolls game ive come to love, and chances are it might be for you as well.",76.1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a game which is in many ways limitless because its a huge sandbox just waiting to be explored its gonna last you for weeks and with the steamworkshop mod support its gonna extend the gameplay and overall experience of the game. i highly recommend you buy it on sales because its too pricy i got it for 40$ and i wasnt complaining but you can get better offers!",187.0

"best game ive played ever awesome graphics and enjoyable cutscenes. all kinds of weapons and armour, magic and so much more. if u want to know how it really is, you should buy it. because there arent enough words to describe the awesomeness",89.3
"okay. you knew this recommendation was going to happen. youve heard how good (and bad) skyrim is. so why not give it a spin?",465.1
"so i started out this game not sure what to expect, it was one of the few games where i start without seeing a lets play of first. i quickly got wrapped up in the intense storyline and quickly beat the main story. the game also includes an abundance of side quest that have taken me much longer to do than the actual storyline. this game is great for rpg loves and would be perfect for a roleplay, assuming you have the multiplayer mod.",207.9
"its skyrim, it needs no introduction - if you havent bought it already then do so.",68.3
"if you are a fan of fantasty, mmorpg, or world of warcraft i would deffenatly reccomend you get this game. you can spend hours on it, there is so much to do, including the quest, and on stealing from people. ;)",69.8
"this game is amazing even with all the bugs and game breaking glitches still a very good rpg. must play at least 200 hours so far on and off, sometimes gets boring, if keep doing the same missions over and over, but there are so many classes to choose, make you keep playing the character creation again and again until you find the class tha fits your game play....",254.6
"this isnt just a game, this is life! no really, i do not know of what one could dislike about this game. whilst it does scream like me as a game title, you cant help but love it as much as it wants you too. the storyline in skyrim is amazingly immersive the first time you play through it. while i played through it i felt a since of urgency to stop alduin and save tamerial from him. the only real downside to this game is that theres not really the ability to be an evil character per example, why not rule beside alduin instead of killing him? why not kill the greybeards once youve the ability to or kill all the jarls and declare yourself king of skyrim? the lack of options in those specific areas are a downside to it. however theres so much content here that youd be an idiot not to buy it. this game is to me, the definition of perfection easily the best game ive played through and then it gets even better with mods. case closed this is a 10 out of 10.",294.0

"my story: i was walking aimlessly around riften, then something caught my eye, a flash, i walked over to investigate. it was a spriggan! i drew my bow and sneaked stealthily around it, i picked an arrow from the quiver, readied it in the bow, pulled back the string... fire! the spriggan falls to the ground but doesnt die, i walk up to it with my sword to finish it off, but, in that moment, it gets back up again! i ready my fire spell and spew forth an inferno. finally... it is vanquished! but, something wasnt right... i hear growling behind me i turn around and fire my bow but i miss! there was nothing to worry about anyway, it was my trusty dog meeko and my noble steed allie. i mount allie with meeko on my lap and set off for another, skyrim adventure 10/10 would kill spriggans again",110.5

"there is no other game i love playing more! if you are an elder scrolls fan you have to get this game and thats that!",62.5
"94 are they high!? it deserves a 98 at least!!! skyrim is a beatifully crreated rpg chocked full of unnecessary (but plain awesome) detail. mind-blowing graphics (for when it wwas released) free updates, a free hi-res dlc and the straight up best modding community out there. the skill system is the best and most dynamic ive ever seen in a vanilla game, both console and pc as well an enriched and immersive landscape, story-line and npc (non player character) ai system. i recommend skyrim, as well as all the other games developed by bethesda, to anyone who likes rpgs, adventure games or action!",143.9
"the adventures in elder scrolls v are as good as it gets. theyve done a truly remarkable job in making a beautiful world where you just want to see what lies around the next river bend or hilltop. skyrim has set the benchmark for graphic excellence in gaming. looking forward to see what they can do with this type of game when they add a more positive script to it!",47.3

"i shouldnt have to write anything about this. just buy it.",154.8
"what a great game! up until this point, ive always been somewhat daunted by the sheer openness of the elder scrolls games but skyrim always gives me something to shoot for. combat is fun and the progression system allows you to chose whatever path you want! while the dragons can be tiresome at times, they still make me say, oh crap, a dragon! in summation, this games not perfect but it comes pretty close with the aid of the steam workshop.",147.0

"well, still the best fantasy rpg on pc i ever played...",179.5
"by it self, skyrim is an ok game. it has some sold rpg with some semi intresting storyline. in my opinion most of the elder scrolls stories, for the most part i found rather dull or just meh. where this game really shines is the player made mods and addons or the steam workshop. with this many players have taken time out of theyre own lives to fix / improve this game and many others for free. many of the mods/addons in the steam work shop are hands down better then anything bethesda every did in theyre dlc. not only is it better but often enough players will even fix the bugs that bethesda made themselves. now that to me means, there really are good gammers/modders out there that are willing to step up and make games better.",174.3
"this has to be one of the greatest games on steam, ive completed it a long time ago on my ps3 butt still but the pc version. and i cant get enough!",72.7
"one of the best elder scrolls games out there. i have played oblivion before i played skyrim and the changes to the combat system takes the game to a whole new level. with all the mod support this game has, it feels like this game will never get old. i have put over 300 hours into skyrim and i have enjoyed every moment of it.",389.2

"i think this is the best game ever because i have played the other elderscrolls as a kid and i think they are going to be gods because they made me happy as a child i really like how they made the game super easy for people who dont enjoy sitting there and roleplaying as if the game isnt covered in cheats. but i like to sit my  down and restrain myself from shortcuts because i am a goob person in my own eyes and like to slowly grind my way up that and its made by bethesda omg swagalaicious company 10/10 would bang",274.0
"console gamers: awh sweet!!! cant wait to kill some dragons! pc gamers: lets see how ty my character can get.",61.3
"i feel this is probably the worst of the elderscrolls games so far. graphically gand gameplay wise there have been massive improvements over oblivion, but while the world is still pretty large it feels like most of it is just empty space. you can spend hours roaming the map and encounter a couple of wolves and a bandit and thats it. the main questline in my opinion while interesting is far too short to play through and can be finished in a handful of hours by a determined player and with less actuall side quests and more bounties there isnt really enough extra content to keep you playing the game. mods are really the only reason ive played so much of it. with such a multitude avaliable where many are balanced and improve the immersion of the game they are really something to look into if you want to get your monies worth from skyrim",211.0
"i wiould absolutely reccommend this game to every person ever!!!!",92.4
"skyrim... one of the best rpg games i have ever played and one of the best experiences i have ever had with a game before. it has a beautiful open world with a new personality in every npc,infact they dont even seem like npcs they have a unique sense of personality that catches you and throws you into the game and the realistic enviroment.i have played this game over and over atleast three or four times and i have had a different experience every time,its a game where you have a certain sense of freedom and a connection with the characters. i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes an action packed open world rpg.",146.0

"the game is fairly fun, but personally i find it lacks complexity and its impossible to fail a quest. it makes the game less fun as an effect as you dont feel mastery as you would in dark souls. this makes skyrim more an rpg on rails.",172.6
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"warning: if you think to start a little session and go away, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahw hell no , this game will suck your soul in it, its amazing, but will  your social life.",84.6
"very recommended! you wont regret to buy it and it is worth it. there are alot of thing you can do in skyrim like adventure, questing and so on. it also provide steamworkshop to provide mods for you to play... overall it is a great game! fus ro dah!",80.1

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim... oh, all the things you can say about this modern marvel. the elder scrolls have always been gams that captured my imagination, and immersed me into the world of tamriel. ever since morrowind i have been an absolute die-hard of the tes, and this game. in tradition to previous elder scrolls, most of what makes the franchise unique is preserved and escalated to new levels. some changes i dont like (such as the previous class system disappearing) but they are hardly a deal breaker, and i often over look them when i see the gorgeous landscapes, dark dungeons, and enchanting lore. a whole laundry list of mods, and hours of fun. buy now",216.5

(same with dragonborn dlc) 5. abilities: in skyrim you can cast magic (destruction spells, conjuration spells - my favorite- and more), have recreational skills (speech, smithing, etc...) or fighting skills (archery, one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons etc...) this game is truly remarkable. you should really consider buying it.",115.8

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"it is not often i get lost in a game like i did with skyrim. everything about this game screams quality and adventure. while bethesda hasnt exactly got a track record for delivering bug-free games at launch, this has been a pleasant, polished and amazing experience so far. a much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system thats amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do. truly a masterpiece.",79.7

"hundreds or even thousands of hours can be invested into this awesome game. ive been playing it since it was released, and i can guarantee that this game will consume all of your time even without mods. it features so many questlines involving the return of the dragons, assassinating people, being a thief, researching a mysterious magical orb, and even join a clan of werewolves. the game leaves you open to create your own unique and creative backstory while also keeping the beginning of the game interesting. if there is anything you dont like about the game, mods can likely change it.",161.5

"worth every penny; for the right price. certainly a great game. very dynamic, beautiful graphics but ive seen better, half-decent combat system and a phenomenal story. the only complaint i have about this game is you have to play it right the first time. dont run through once, and then make another character to do all of the side quests. take in the entire game all at once and you wont regret it whatsoever. great installment for the series which removes as much static gameplay as it can.",17.1

"i highly reccomend this game, if you havnt played this game you are missing out big time! this game has sooo much to do and with mods that you can downlaod from the steam workshop makes this game amazing i have played for at least 300 hours. i have had this game for xbox and ps3 and now pc and i have to say it is much better on pc but i do reccomend that if you buy this game from steam get the skyrim in color mod from the steam workshop it makes the game look amazingly beutiful!",64.8
"this game is so good that i cannot run it on my pc because my pc sucks so hard that i cannot run it, but yet i have 68 hours played on pc, probobly 300 on xbox 360 but i must give this a thumbs down because compared to oblivion and morrowind this game is a dumbed down game for a younger audience if you are a hardcore gamer you will absolutely hate this game but if you are a person who doesnt care about the unique values to the older games and you just want to sit down and have a good time than this is your game, but however i am not one of these people, i have beaton oblivion 8 times and skyrim 3, 2 times on xbox and once on pc simply because skyrim has no replay-ability once so ever you can replay it once and it is the same game, it is almost like playing a really long midieval call of duty game accept not as stupid. do not get me wrong i love skyrim the game itself but anyday i would rather play oblivion sorry bethesda and zenimax but skyrim is for 11 year olds and oblivion is for teenagers / adults and morrowind is for hardcore gamers, i am glad to see that eso will have some of the features that oblivion had though",68.6

"such a diverse game completely customizable especially when installing mods that allow you to play it however you want! (emphasis on the you hahahaha) such an amazing role-playing experience, each and every run through always leads to a completely new story, wonderful replayable value: it has never become boring and stale. definitely a game needed in your library to make into the gaming experience you want it to be, please take time and effort to invest in this game and the nexus site for mods. one of my all time favourites in gaming! thank you bethesda!!! <3",562.0

"-skyrim; im not sure how i can review this, never having played older tes games, but i can safely say, after a better playthrough, this is a good game. -gameplay is pretty varied, ranging from full-on combat, using magic, or my all-time favourite: sneaking. -combat... isnt brilliant. it isnt stiff like a rock, but still a bit rough. it has some dinamic though, like executions, different attacks for different directions, and special effects like extra damage on undead, or freeze damage on stamina and magicka, etc. -as for quests, i feel like the game really shined in the guild quests, the companions, college, and thieves. but was lackluster on early-game story missions. that being my opinion though. -side missions are interesting at least, but some are/seem boring and occupy space on your journal. -the leveling system works a bit weird, differently from what im used to. by getting good at a skill: one handed, destruction spells, lockpicking you gain overall exp, then you use tab and click level up, not fully fond of it. -overall, id give it an 8/10 since a max rating has to be a perfect game for me, and i have not found one yet. -leave your feedback below. thanks",42.5
"what can i say? the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best (and most addictive) games i have ever played. even years after its release many people still play this masterpiece. the community has also added hundreds more hours worth of play time through the mods found on the steam workshop and the nexus. definately worth your time (although be careful you dont play it too much...) i would rate it 10/10 for sure.",627.1
"skyrim is amazing, defiantly recommend for medieval lovers. here is a poem i wrote about skyrim! skyrim the sky was blue, it was true snowy mountains, huge lands the one who seeks adventure didnt know what he had inside what he could do, with the power could he fly, could he reach the sky no, but he was the dragonborn the one and only who could defeat the ancient ones the ones who could fly, glide and attack track their foes, eat their toes the dragonborn can intake their soul he can kill any sort of troll sword slashing, kicking and bashing loot the things you have killed sell the items, receive money and then buy a bunny burn a chicken, raid a house be stealthy like a tiny mouse get married or become a wizard like harry potter level up by doing quests to become the best but now youre crying because the villager was lying then you come back into reality and realise it`s only a game!",39.5
"a true epic story unfolds as you strive to survive the harsh climate and perilous land of skyrim, trying at the same time to hone your abilities to an extreme and face an ancient and evil foe of the world: alduin... this game is a remarkable jewel for your computer game library; one of those few exceptions that no matter how many hours you play, you always go back for more. this can only outline the profound immersion you feel when you start playing from the very first minutes. in this wondrous world you get to fight myriads of undead, wild animals, thugs of all tamriel races, or even take sides and participate in a full scale war. the only downside i have felt with this game are some bugs that appear now and then, mostly having to do with distorted laws of physics, but i must admit that a lot of work has been invented by both the official dev team and modders all over the world alike to fix most of them. and in case *kidding* you can just imagine that in a magical fantasy world, maybe it is fine for a dragon to occasionally fly backwards! the game gets polished and enriched continuously and one can really tell by the multitude of accompanying mods freely available on steam. skyrim remains a solid investement for many hours of fun on end, even after 2 full years from its official publish date (11/11/11) !",528.5

"simply put, one of the best games i have ever had the opportunity to play, the graphics are incredible, the story is rich in content and the dialog is realistic and not overly dramatic, allowing you to immerse yourself in your adventures within skyrim and not realize that 14 hours have gone by sense you started playing. i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games that provide more then just shiny graphics, but also a rich story and vast hours of content that can be replayed in litterally dozens of different ways. -daggaroth",124.7

"the elder scroll v: skyrim is the latest installment in the elder scrolls series. with revamped combat/ magic systems, skyrim is sure to have a newer, more refreshing feel to the gameplay. skyrim sports an inumerable amount of content which can be played again and again in one of the largest worlds to ever grace a video game. combat in skyrim however can feel a little more rigid than in previouse installments. many of the larger fights will require you to pause in multiple occassions so that you could switch weapons/ spells or even heal up with a potion. with no true hotkeys, combat just feels a little less pleasing when you have to pause time to switch that one spell. over all, skyrim is a very well done video game which will provide many hours of gameplay.",58.3

"easily one of the greatest games of all time........and the mod community bumps it up another notch from there!",101.9
"skyrim is an amazing game with great graphics and an really good storyline. not to mention the mods. the mods are awsome and so is the community. over all its just a great game >:}",191.3
"i didnt know what the fuss about skyrim was... until i started double weiling spells, reanimating zombies, casting lightning and fire at the same time at my enemies, quiclky switching between axes, bows and spells, summoning familiars, fist-fighting dragons, blowing off enemies with my mighty roar and eating the beating hearts of my victims as i rampage in my werewolf form. just...amazing. i only wish it was easier to mke money, stupid stores never have enough cash to buy your loot.",23.8
"wonderful game, if a bit buggy and filled plot farts. on the plus, its fun and gives a sense of thrill to adventure out into the open world, fight monsters, get treasure, the choice help people or hurt them... its quite the experience and i always enjoy every minute i put into this game. on the down side, underdeveloped plot in some areas, especially in side quests, left me wanting more out of it all. the textures can be blotchy at best sometimes, and sometimes the game is just downright broken. despite the major hurdles -which we all know most elder scrolls games are fixer uppers in the end- its still an amazing adventure, and being a es fan since morrowind, i am proud to say this game is worth your time and money. ive spent hundreds of hours on the xbox360 verison. c:",98.3
"the immersion is amazing before i went to sleep today i opened up my phone to save the game and then i realized it was real life and i didnt have to save. damn also mods. 11/10",63.5

"you just get lost in the world of skyrim, through beuatiful graphics (on ultra) and intense boss fights as well as a really good story. be a mage, swordsman or archer, or a combination of the 3 and you are in for a wonderfu time. (had it for 8 days, played almost 50hours)",92.7

"my god, this game is so perfect i cant even describe it with words. you have to play it. the gameplay changes entirely depending on your skills, which race you are, and what items youve picked up. there is so much to do, its overwhelming. even doing nothing is entertaining, because the environment and settings are so beautiful. 10/10 if i could only play one game for the rest of my life, this would win hands down.",72.7
"this game is amazing. there are so many great mods for it that even when you beat the story (which can take hundredes of hours if you do side quests) theres still plenty more to do.",92.9
"a masterpiece of modern rpg gaming. if you liked morrowind and fallout 3 / new vegas you will enjoy this a lot. it perfectly paints a picture of a vibrant world. the quests themselves are compelling and will keep you guessing right until their conclusion. feel free to roam around the countryside hunting dragons and mining til your pockets are full!",42.1

"well to start off nice and positive, - the game has a lot of content to keep you entertained for hundreds of hours - mod support on steam is great - over 1000+ weapons and armor (including enchanted versions of the same armor/weapon) - story telling is fairly good now to end it with a little bit of negatives, - game contains a few bugs here and there - would be nice to have online support (just a joke here) ;d great game, worth the money if you have no already purchased it.",96.9

"skyrim is an rpg game with an big open world and thousands possibilities to make. its also ultimately modable which make this game pure gold. however all you need to know about this game: 1. skyrim is never ending game and i been playin it since it came out, later i activated it on steam. with mods installed you will have ultimate game and hours of fun. 2.you can play skyrim however you want there is lot of ways for your playstyle. increase skills which suits you the best! 3. no matter how badass you look do not try kill giants on low level. trust me! it could ruin your self-esteem.. 4. dont kill a frickin chicken unless you want rot in jail or get killed by angry people. with killing emperor you shouldnt have to much problems. 5. skyrim is highly addictive game which will make your day disappear like your money in a wallet so be careful try maintain communication with your family,friends and so on. i highly recommend this game 10/10",311.7
"aahh.... perhaps a little too late for this games review but nevertheless. the elder scrolls series, a wonder of rpg games in the years. ive started the series with oblivion when i saw it in a cyber cafe a few years back and see all the classic table top rpg element inside it. i thoroughly enjoyed the game of course and cannnot wait for skyrim to come out, which was announced a few month after my discovery of oblivion. firstly, i was expecting its mechanism to stay but was a little disappointed in its simplicity instead. everything is too simplified and for the npcs.... the only good thing about them is their quests and nothing more, despite their somewhat colourful personalities. the role-playing this time focuses a lot on quests instead of a more broad purpose. it would seem that skyrim is made for its combat system, which was never a strong part in the elder scroll series in my opinion and is not so impressive in here either. swing, swing, occasional block and such. however, the finishing blow is admittingly the best thing to do in combat. skyrims environment however is what really makes it beautiful. to be able to explore the province of skyrim in its fullest, fast travel is almost going to be unused.... almost. all in all, it is a good adventure game despite lacking in its role-playing.",180.4
"after killing the bride vittoria vici with a big rock - i was the new fiance of asgeir snow-shod. and he was very happy about it! not only a game - it was a very exciting and heroic adventure especially the second time! one of the best games ever! 10/10",255.5

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"the best thing with this game is the mods. you can find whatever mod you want, as a batman fan i found lots of batman stuff. the gameplay: 8/10, why i didnt give 10/10 is because the finishing moves sometimes bugs and sometimes when you place buckets, kettles etc the npcs bug into them. when you walk into a room your follower sometimes stands on the exit/entrance so you cant get out. the graphics: 9/10, the only problem is the rocks they look pretty bad. the skilltree: 8/10 they would have added some extra stuff but with the help of mods i can fix this so it will become 10/10",296.1

"im a first time owner/player of any titles by bethesda, and specifically in the elder scrolls franchise, but i must say that skyrim is, by far, the best non-japanese role-playing/adventure game ive ever had the pleasure of playing. im only a few levels up and a few areas in as a nord, but ive never been as thrilled to be on such a rivetting adventure. the customization and storytelling in the game are amazingly detailed, and the abi;lities are consistantly impressive. i only wish i could perform aerial attacks, but i suppose that is not in there because it would not make as much real-world sense if this were the real world.",51.2

"skyrim in my opinion is one of the best rpgs out there at the moment featuring many different quests and paths for your character to take. it is most certainly worth purchasing the full game alongside the downloadable content if you want a game that never gets boring and changes everytime you play it.",69.7

"ive never been a fan of the bucolic. i much prefer the man-made harshness of concrete and neon to the pastoral settings the fantasy genre has chained itself to. skyrim manages to enchant me though. packed with abandoned locales and small villages, i felt more like a tourist than a warrior. lakes, caves, and snow-covered mountaintops are repositories of mysteries that i couldnt help but dig through.",243.0

"probably the best open-world rpg out there. definitely one of my all-time favourite games. the replayability is superb and the modding community is highly active, which makes it easy to play the game the way you want to play it. for me the modding experience has been the greatest aspect of the game. you can easily make the game graphics look like up to date games (as long as you have a decent graphics card). the atmosphere in the game and the way the game feels alive is something that will keep amaze you throughout the game. it really feels like a living world, even though you will stumble upon bad or awkward npc movements and behaviour (but mods can help fix this). the music and voice acting is as good as it can get. if you like rpgs there are no reasons why you shouldnt own this game already. 10/10.",80.1
"everyone talks about how great this game is, and its pretty good, open modding and the ability to do anything anytime you want sounds awesome. vikings and magic, in theory i love it. the downside is not so much. i realize games like this take years to make and hundreds of man hours are put into it. but it just wasnt polished enough. i wanted to love this game, i tried. but it kept throwing me out of it. (not like a broken game install error) but a immersion issue. for instance: i was the arch mage of the wizards guild, yet everytime i went to a main city and run into the city wizards they would tell me i should go to the wizards guild to apprentence. seriously, do they not know i am the arch mage? i couldnt have been that much harder to get a sound recording of the wizards saying welcome arch mage. and when you finish the arch mage quest they say that instead of youre a novice. there were more, nothing seriously huge, just polishing bits, it was enough though to throw me out of the game and i could never get back in. i still play from time to time, but there are more immersive games out there i would rather play.",64.1
"i have played this game for days straight on my xbox 360 and it is amazing, i traded in 42 ps2 games a ps2, 2 remotes and two memory cards plus fifty dollars in cash to buy it, so i went and bought it on pc as well. it has a true elder scrolls feel to it and it is great to explore the map over and over plus the mods that can be installed are practically endless. 100/10 1010%",60.4
"i think this is a good adventure game and it has plenty of action.",221.9
"wow! im not sure where to start on this grand game. i have and continue to enjoy this classic game as indicated by the many hours i have spent adventuring with my many companions. you cannot and will not be bored as long as you seek out the next few hundred quests heaped upon the hundreds of quests you have already completed. played on a pc, this is a modders wonderland. the cinematic beauty contained within the huge open world that is skyrim is totally awesome as evidenced by the thousands of screenshots posted each and every day on the steam servers. i will never finish this game. this is not a game to be won or finished by trying to follow the main quest lines. this game is like a fine wine; to be enjoyed by sitting by a lake and enjoying a wonderful view. climbing that mountain in the distance. running with your companions through the meadows and fields, riding your horses to the next town and enjoy some brews with the villagers. singing songs and dancing on tables. killing vampires, werewolves, bandits, dragons, and any manner of bad guy that you can imagine. this game is only limited by limited thinkers. enjoy this game for what it truly is, an epic masterpiece to be enjoyed by an adventurer. gamers need not apply. have fun and long live the dragonborn!",492.4

"this is a fantastic game! dont be fooled by my recorded hours on steam; ive logged more hours than i can count playing this game on the xbox 360. bethesda has done a tremendous job creating an entire universe that you are free to explore and interact with in any way you choose, right down to who your character is, what he/she can do, and how he/she looks. there is so much to do all the time, so you can always do something different each time you play. the graphics are terrific, and the environment in skyrim is absolutely beautiful. bethesdas attention to detail is exquisite, and the general look of the game shows how much effort theyve put into their graphics. overall, the gameplay is great. the combat controls are very simple, which makes it easy to fight your enemies. leveling up your character and choosing different skills to hone are also very simple tasks. its easy to play as a warrior, mage, thief, or a mixture. you can be anything or anyone you want to be in this game. the story lines are good as well. there are all sorts of story lines that you can play through in addition to the main quest, and all of the ones ive played through have been quite enjoyable. on a scale of 1 to 10, id give skyrim a 9.5. when you play it, you see why its such an acclaimed, well-respected game.",35.1
"a game that no one should hate, best game ever to be playing even when there mods. anyone who hate this game are just a hater and a no one so pay no attention to them. this game can cause anyone to be playing for more than 400+hr and it wont stop there.",70.2
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"buy this game for the engine, then download gazillion mods for optimal experience. overall a fairly enjoyable game with many technical improvements over previous tes, but vanilla skyrim is nowhere as wide open or offer enough freedom and content as its predecessors. oh, and what a nice console port--be sure enjoy the terribly limited consolized menus for inventory and combat as well as the watered down graphics. does bethesda really expect the community to provide hd textures for every damn thing? /tsundere",309.0

"the only downside is that whenever i install this game again i have to install a hundred mods. ok, theres also the downside that i feel its a bit monotone compared to some other rpgs and i dont often feel invested in nps. but its skyrim and ive also put in probably 40 more hours than listed here before i had it on steam. i played through the main quest and some others and enjoyed myself every time i played. had to make a call to try and complete other games instead of just putting in 300 hours here.",81.6

"wonderful addition to the series bethesda softworks fifth game of the elder scrolls series delivers dungeon diving, dragon killing, thieving, and so much more that you would normally expect from an elder scrolls game. shouts that can make enemies fly back off a mountain, ores in which you can mine, several guilds to join, and countless enemies to battle are all included in this game. although all these wonderous additions are existent in skyrim, there are some minor setbacks. the essential characters as they are called in game are invincible beings that are important quest characters. they cant be killed, they are human (or elf/orc/lizard/cat), and they break the immersion that many players play the elder scrolls for. also the quests are impossible to fail unless they are a misc. quest. the integration of steam workshop made mods accessable and easy to use which can increase/decrease immersion depending on the mod and increase replay value as well as hours your spend playing the game. overall the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an excellent addition to your game library and is definitely worth $30 despite its flaws.",154.4

"great game. its long, but its hardly boring, theres always something to do, especially if you have the legendary edition. tons of quests, tons of npcs to talk to, tons of places to explore, creatures to slay, landscapes to admire. i enjoyed every single hour spent in skyrim. if you think you wont like it because you didnt like morrowind or oblivion, well, try skyrim anyway, its so different than previous tes games. if you liked gothic, skyrim is for you. if you are a good player, start on master or even legendary difficulty. you can play on the easiest difficulty though, as there are no achievements related to difficulty, so pick whatever works best for you. and one pro-tip- if you are up to get all the achievements, join stormcloaks or imperials before advancing in main story and complete all the missions for them. thats because while theres peace negotiations in high hrothgar (main story), you can make mistake, giving all the keeps to the side you are planning to ally with. this will prevent you from getting conquer fort sungard/greenwall missions, as these forts will be yours already, and the achievement requires you to actually conquer them in battle.",92.4

"a must played, for every pc gamer that have a graphic card able to run at ultra.... damn its amazing.",49.9

"this is the best game ive ever played, and if you are on the verge of getting it dont hesistate get it now! (small warning it will kill your social life without hesitation)",110.8
"this game is so much fu n to play and yet beautiful when you install the dlcs and graphic mods to it. it sucks that i had to delete my lvl 38 char because of a game error but i ma happy to start on a new adventure every time. this game is a work of art and its the only one of its kind! 10/10",281.6
"fun, exciting and a blast. feels fresh and new from obilivion, even the story!",33.7
"instructions unclear. caught dragon in ceiling fan",15.3
"honestly, one of the greatest games i have ever played. when the critics first said this was worth over a hundred hours of gameplay, they were not kidding. over 120hrs and im still loving it. theres just so much to do on skyrim its crazy. i approve 15/10.",138.3
"certainly one of the greatest elder scrolls adventures yet",814.7
"its fun until you sit back and think about it, and then the poor plot and presentation spoil the enjoyment for those who care about such things. its a bethesda game in every way where that means something.",203.2
"skyrim is an open world rpg in the popular elder scrolls series. skyrim does a good job on improving on oblivion by removing the disappointing levelling system and with more handcrafted dungeons and other locations. combat in skyrim is immensely fun and is definitely the best it has ever been in the elder scrolls series, the graphics are also significantly better giving the different races a far unique appearance. mods are incredibly easy to use now thanks to the steam workshop which gives skyrim far more replayability and allows for graphical and gameplay enhancement. unfortunately some areas of the game including magic has been simplified. theres far fewer spells in skyrim than there was in oblivion and morrowind and also fewer weapon types. the ui is also horribly simplified possibly from the consoles but luckily this is easily fixed with mods. overall skyrim is easily one of the greatest rpgs in recent years and a game i would definetely recommend.",310.5
"brillant game great fun to play had it on ps3 but pc is much easyer to play it lots of great features gamers must have :)",95.6
"i love the elder scrolls franchise. amazing games. it just gets better in skyrim. graphics are 10/10 amazing. a 1gb graphics card will do the job. so why read reviews get this game now",14.1
"a great addition to the elderscrolls library, even if it weighs a bit on the hand-holdy no-real-exploration-reward-besides-pretty front... btw, it is extremely pretty... google fimbulvinter enb, download it, use it.... also get better quest objectives (then turn off the compass and use a legit map with no markers), and then welcome in hundreds (literally) of hours of pure joy and rewarding fun ive played through both the xbox and this version of the game, logging hundreds of hours on both... its difficult to say any other single player rpg that is capable of that much content (besides other elderscrolls games) if you want this, or like rpgs at all, do get this",587.4
"a friend said: this games steal your life! and i answer: no, it gives you a new one!. a masterpiece as everything related to elder scroll, excellent graphics, excellent game play, its strongly recommendable.",32.2
"great visuals,modding capablities extreme detail and replability 10/10 buy it now would buy again",196.7
"in my opinion one of the best games ever made... lots of gameplay, lots of story great dlc. when you finished the story there is so much left to explore. love the game and the mods. community is great too. they make the best mods and add-ons. thats why im looking forward to es: online! 9.9/10",24.3
"skyrim certainly had a lot to love up to after the wonderful experience that was oblivion. after playing over 100 hours i can safely say that it lives up to it, and then some. skyrim is a stunning open world rpg with so much to do and so many places to see. the class and race variety is really deep so that you can play with pretty much any style you like. the theme of the place is mostly snow but there are a lot of different themes too with some of the nice green landscapes that we liked from oblivion. if you decide to just wander off somewhere you will always run into a new place with something to do. the main quest can be brief if you just follow this but the side quests really open things up and add to the whole skyrim experience. overall i loved the game and would put it in the must play section. would run into whiterun and kill all the people just for the lulz again. 10/10",107.2
"just wow. ive played many bethesda games and this is one that has cahnged rpgs forever. with hundreds of hours of gameplay and perfect replay-value, this game will keep you occupied. there are also many many mods to choose from if you wish. but the skills, races, items, quests, and combat styles (well its like archery, melee, or sneaking) you know there is always something to do in this game. get it now!",267.7
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4
"my most! favroite game of all time, nothing beats it.",134.1
"i did most of my time in skyrim on the xbox 360. i probably had 500+ hours on it. this is the best singleplayer game out there. if someone asked me to pick a game and only one game it would be skyrim and with the mods of course :)",48.9
"i highly recommend at least trying this game series.",54.1
"this game is very enjoyable if you like rpgs and a rich story. i have played many hours on it. there are a few mission bugs that do sour my game experience but not enough for me to stop playing. its an amazing game. highly recommended.",185.6

"if youre reading this, youve probably been living under a rock. #doitforthebadge",4.1
"the game is very easy to get addicted to: cool storyline, beautiful scenery and exciting quests... what more can one wish for, right? well i wanted to play skyrim so i bought the game in the afternoon a few days ago. then i visited a friend only 2-3 hours later and at that point he opened steam and there was the release of the winter sales which would have made the game 50% cheaper. so my problem here is that instead of recieving a warning that the holiday sales are arriving in the news feed or when u try to purchase the game itself, there was no warning at all, nothing that made it seem that the game would be 50% off two hours after i paid the full price. instead of recieving a pop-up window telling me to wait one or two hours for the actual discount to kick in, i didnt get any information on the sales and had to pay the full price.",36.7
"skyrim. play as you want, and do what you want. this game is huge, and epic.",65.0
"skyrim is the second game in the oblivion series and quite frankly just doesnt hit the mark. bethasda has completely dropped the oblivion story as and rather than stay true to the oblivion series chose to opt with a futuristic based cyrodil after a war, featuring dragons that are not from oblivion. there is no emporer in this game which i found to be a problem and the blades are fighting dragons instead of oblivion which doesnt make any sense in the story. no one ever meantions. oh it doesnt fit in with the story of the mmo version either. 5/10 but only because its part of the oblivion franchise.",155.0
"thanks to the modding community, im nowhere close to being tired of this game.",693.2
"really good game. better than oblivion. worked and improved a lot of aspects. huge time sink if you keep looking for things to do. it is truly your adventure.",490.7
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",71.8
"one of the greatest games i have ever played. blows my mind that this game can be fun even after 200+hours. a must have game.",315.7
"its like fallout but with magic, more epic environments and landscapes, improved graphics, amazing soundtracks, huge world to explore, etc. fallout is epic as well, but this game goes beyond that. everything that is good, this game has it!! except for the freaking spiders which has become a nightmare for me. yes, im arachnophobic. i know that there are mods to replace it but im a bit lazy at the moment. :| my rating: 10/10",130.9

"ever wanted to be a man/lizard/cat thing who got adopted by dragons, turns into a werewolf, has a shout that can slow down time, that becomes a thief,who then goes to kill his adopted parents and wields a giant hammer made out of glass? then get this game.",169.5
"what can be said that hasnt already been said. awesome game, especially with the duel realism and athirya (ace) mod. my favorite playthrough was an orc warrior. vanilla skyrim favors the warrior, whereas oblivion favored the mage (imo). block, one-handed, archery, and heavy armor are your bread and butter if you want an easy playthrough. most creatures dont have immunity to fire, since skyrim is a cold place. dont waste your time enchanting things with lightning (shock) or frost. its all about the flame in skyrim. great game. you can tell by the amount of hours ive put in.",263.2
"i have not been able to fully play it.. but i am able to write about this game due to having the xbox edition. i know already so much of this game that i bought every edition for it (cross-platform). i made my own houses at the location i wanted (due to hearthfire dlc), i customized it to my preferences, and i got my in-game wife to live in the building i made. i kill dragons, citizens, archers, animals, and even enemies like vampires and werewolves. this game gives you the freedom to do everything you want and the way you want. you should always be remembered that as you quest.. your choices actually affect the game. skyrim is just one of those games we thought as kids and a game that i will look back to... even when i am an adult.",6.5
"overall, a really amazing game that gives the player a lot to explore and learn about the huge world of the elderscrolls. in detail, this review being in 2014, id give: gameplay : 8/10 story : 9/10 graphics : 7/10 (without mods) sound : 7.5/10 a great purchase for those looking for a deep medieval/nordic style rpg",27.3

"this is the best game ever!!! next to fallout:new vegas and gmod and dayz",55.0
"excellent arrow to knee taking simulator, i rate it 5 sporks out of 5 xd",12.3
"very good game, you will get many hours out of this. it does suffer from bugs and not so good storyline, but most of the bugs can be fixed with mods and many mods that adds more quests and improve some quest. absolutely worth the money and dont regret buying it one second. one of the best games around!",558.7
"this is one of the greatest open world games of all time. bethesda is a master of building a breathing world with some decent combat mechanics, always interesting story-lines. im not sure it quite reaches the heights of oblivion or fallout 3, but damn if it isnt a really good time all the same. if you like this game, be sure to go play fallout 3, and try out oblivion. oblivion may feel a bit dated in ways but its an incredible game as well.",107.9
"skyrim is an amazing rpg! definitely worth picking up, and even more so when its on sale!",45.6
"wheres the good part there isnt one its not the combat or the surface plot or the dialog or the characters or the writing its not the empty world nor the one dimensional combat system where is it",76.0

"this game was great from start to finish. 9/10 p.s kill that priest in whiterun asap you wont regret it",548.0
"a deep, imersive action rpg on its own. once you start to add new addons it becomes a whole new game.",61.1
"very well done. this game is as good as oblivion. while the quests may be more hand-holding and less figure things out, the game did manage to balance the leveling up system. the perk tree is more enjoyable than having to micromanage progression of skills. again, another world you can be absorbed in for 100 hours and still not do everything. also, kids cant die for whatever reason. hide in a town, kill people and watch as everyone panics. hilarity ensues.",48.8

"skyrim is the best game ive ever played but the glitches and the freezing are getting very annoying they should maintain the game by adding patches to try to improve it",304.6
"elder scrolls v: skyrim has so much content. its gameplay has been vastly improved since the last elder scrolls game, such as the floaty combat and levelling mechanics. bethesda softworks puts effort in their development of games, and each elder scrolls game is an improvement and a lesson learned from the last game.",326.7
"one of the best rpgs in recent history with a nice snabox feel, my only complaints are the bugs, which are at times hilarious but can also be annoying to deal with and sometimes quest breaking. overall a good experience for anyone interested in tailoring an adventure to suit their own style of play.",135.3
"i love this game. it has a huge world that is packed with content and everytime i playthrough the game its different to say the least.",655.4
"damn.....i am impressed by the graphics (if u have a good computer) and the gameplay...wow...... after u complete the main storyline, dont stop! there are a ton of side quests waiting to be done! buy this game. its sooooo good! :)",72.5
"addictive, like crack cocaine. but very well done. storyline is great, the fighting mechanics are reasonably well-done, but the main draw is the open-world environment where you can do anything. there are hundreds of side quests. the best part is that on a pc, there are tons of cool mods.",172.1
"a good single player game with a very good story and a large amount of side quests. pc version beats the console version due to mods, mods, and alot more mods....",976.9
"not my type of game, its a great game, but not my type.",39.1
"played skyrim for so long and finished it - although you can never finish it really - and then left it for a while. came back after a year and replayed it from the beginning and added dlc - never gets old - a true classic.",206.6
"in the list of games of the generation contenders, this makes the cut. if you like open world rpgs, this is a must-play. its easy to get lost in the wilderness and just enjoy the experience. my favorite part is wandering through the world and stumbling upon a new adventure. amazing game!",69.3
"a very addictive game that makes you feel the need for continuing. brilliant.",163.9
"besides pokemon as a child, this is probably the most time engaging and entertaining game i have played. every playthrough is different and for me there is still hundreds of hours of content still to do on top of what i have already done on ps3 and xbox. mods add an entirely new view into the world and lore of skyrim, but besides that, the vanilla version is easily one of the best games i have played. if youre debating on whether or not to buy it, keep in mind its not for everyone, but if you like an open world with amazing lore and hundreds of hours to play through, then this is a game for you.",7.9
"this game just kicks !! i love it! the add ons (dawnguard, dragonborn and hearthfire) are worth the money too! the hours just fly by so i 100% recommend this game! 10/10",1.3
"lots of bugs, because theres a lot of freedom, so lots of fun. a definitive must play.",31.2
"best played on higher difficulties this game takes many modern elements of rpg and smashes them into one. with an awesome modding community this game is to be consedered one of the best pc games of all time!",71.1

"i played other fantasy rpgs before, then i took an arrow to the knee, and started playing this one.",178.2
"this is the most beautiful game in existence. i recommend it to everyone, not just fantasy rpg inclined people. in fact, ive never been one with a penchant for fantasy before being introduced to this game. 5/5.",162.3
"theres no reason to have not played skyrim unless your computer lacks the ability to do so. i normally dont like games like this that include magic abilities but ive had way too much fun with this game. my hour count does not reflect my gameplay time. i had a less-than-legitimate version of this before i bought it on steam and i played countless times through the game. i guarantee ive put over 250 hours in and i still havent seen half the content.",74.2
"incredible game, astonishing immersion and epic storyline. i played this for more than two years and i got to say i still feel like i could do more. if you get bored, there is a ton of mods, which are, in my opinion, the best part of the game. i used to think mods are useless and bad for the game until i tried in this one.",0.3
"great open world experience, deep story and good choices to make in game. really like oblivion but i find this games more like a fallout successor as apart from universe and some game elements, it doesnt feel much like playing a oblivion sequel. story and gameplay is good and made better with steam workshop mods. highly recommend.",86.2
"an incredible game. seeing bethesda as the publisher you should already assume its nothing short of awesome. a very immersive game. something that will occupy you for 300+ hours without mods, dlc, or nexus. mods will add endless hours just experimenting with them and seeing whats out there. $19.99 is a great price for a game of skyrims magnitude. a must buy.",345.6

"skyrim is one of my favorite games. the graphics, quests, detailed stories, etc. are spectacular, even during the glitches. also, im glad theres a workshop because a lot of people are creating awesome mods! its great to see so much talent and effort bethesda and other gamers put into a really fun game and i hope theres a lot more to come!",212.1

"this game has taken days from me. i gladly enjoy losing my days to skyrim. even if i havent beaten the game yet.",148.4
"this game, eventhough it has a few glitches, is an almost perfect game, i say almost because the length of the main story isnt that long, but the amount of side quests and all the things you can become involved in is pretty numerous. the graphics are outstanding, the music is amazin which adds to the epicness of the game. you will never play a game made before this that has a more interactive combat system. because of the creation kit, players can create homes, towns, dungeons, quests, weapons, armor, accesories, alter crafting, even change the overall look of the game world itself. worth every penny.",66.1

"400 hours and counting. i bought this game at its midnight release and havent uninstalled nor stopped playing it since. literally countless* hours of gameplay and the replay value is extraordinary. not only was skyrim a great game to play right out of the case but with the workshop, new textures and online** utilities; that already great game is now able to stand the test of time. the only game that will ever take skyrims place as number one will most likely have to be the elder scrolls vi, just as skyrim took oblivions place. good work bethesda and community modders everywhere. 10/10 * with mods **skyrim nexus",844.7

"this game to me, is the best game ever produced in any category and any age. there is no equal to this game, not even close. if you want to get immersed in a world where you can do pretty much anything you feel like, then this is the game for you. what makes this game so awesome is not only the scenery but the easy way of getting around and quick interchangable functions, for example the 1st to 3rd person swap is simply a mouse roll and back, if you feel like it. and not to mention the thousands of mods and add-ons for those who want a different look or feel. i played this for over a year before i even touched a mod, because yes it is that good even in vanilla mode. playing different characters, doing different missions (not including the main steering objective), i can see anyone young or old playing this game for years. not bad for a single player game, which i would admit is probably the only downside to this game. i recommend this to everyone, young or old! but do get the complete game with dlcs and add-ons, or get the legendary edition which contains everything. its imperative that you have all of them.",220.9
"one of my favorite games ever, finished it on xbox and loved it so much i decided to do it again on pc. the improvement in load times alone is so great, it was worth buying again just for that. i cant wait to put another 100 hours into this great game, not to mention all the great mods that are available.",72.4

"great game, except for some small details. i love this game and its world, but the only thing i wish had been done better is the way your actions impact the world. you, the dragonborn, walk into some such city, after you just saved it from a dragon by eating its soul, and the gaurds will passively say things about how they are also the dragonborn and what not. no people running up to congraulate you, and no one really giving a damn about the pure badass-ery you just pulled off. another thing, combat. the combat system is either one of 2 settings: a field of bunnies to murder at will, or dark-souls level. everything is based off your level, which means as you grow stronger, so does everything else. a level one you could (probably) defeat a dragon, on almost the same terms as a level 10 you. personally, these are my only qualms, but the game itself is still amazing.",62.0
"fun game however they should of had more voice actors",430.3
"if possible, i would play this over participating in real life.",591.5
"i recommend skyrim for those who want an rpg with endless possibilities. why because modders never stops developing new mods everyday, every week. you can find mods that gives you new land and adventures, skin and other important aspect to improve your skyrim from vanilla to actually new game, i can see this reason why bethesda drops any updates for this game because, modders already got it better than what they had been created. so finally, all i can say is this is a must-have game and you will never ever ever regret owning skyrim.",235.7
"if u ever play this game... dont expect to stop!!!",64.1

"skyrim is nice game,but thing that make this game special are mods. mods offer whole new experience in game and make skyrim whole new game with better graphics and awesome content. when i stealth kill someone dragonborn says: surprise motherf***er ,and you can add naked chicks in game too. 10/10",24.7

"i think this game is a great game. however it is not flawless i hate the people who think this is the greatest elder scrolls game. most people will tell you this is the best one because this is the first one they have played and then they go back and play the previous ones suck. if you want a game that has nice visuals and combat i suggest this game, if you want to be lost in a story and a lore and be the charter of the time i suggest playing oblivion or marrow wind. with all that being said this is still a great game.",76.3

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"really good game, and tons of easy to install mods in the workshop.",97.0
"when i first played skyrim on the xbox, i was hooked into the world of the elder scrolls instantly. however, when i later decided to buy the legendary edition of skyrim on steam, i found myself in a whole new world. the world i found myself in was the ultimate modding community, which consisted mainly of the steam workshop and skyrim nexus. there are endless amounts of mods you can add into your game to make skyrim seem like a whole new game entirely. even if you own a console version of tesv: skyrim, you should own the pc version just because of the mods. with mods, you can make skyrim look like a game that came out yesterday with multiple enchancements of gameplay, graphics, and even sounds. overall, i recommend this game to anyone with a love for gaming.",144.3
"shoot magic more magic some melee and bows and just being a frickin criminal. and some quests...but mostly the above.",129.0
"a great detailed and immersive game, that gives you hours of fun and enjoyment.",321.9

"one of the best rpgs of all time. i love the console version but the mods on the pc are the best. the game will never get old.",4.6
"fun game, definitely worth it if your computer is able to handle a lot of mods, as a lot of the fun is the modding community. thanks to the ck its really easy to make mods and stuff, so if youre a modder you should check it out as well. the lore is alright, and the storyline is pretty good. even if youre on a lower end pc or laptop (like i was when i first got it) it runs fine albeit not as beautifully. regardless, worth the price, even at $20. except maybe get legendary edition, because the dlc becomes way cheaper.",253.9
"in the early days of cinema there where a variety of movies that capitalized on low cost special effects, skyrim borrows a lot from these types of films. by shouting at enemies, and even goats, you make them stumble backwards as if by magic. this isnt revealed to you until youre half way through the game and told by mysterious shouting from atop a mountain that you must trek up the mountain and meet these shouters. youre then tasked with saving the world, again, and the most critical choice of the entire game comes after youve actually completed the game. time travel is involved, and theres plenty of goofy throwbacks to horrible movies in the form of a vampire den full of well-to-do vampire lords who thrive for thousands of years doing things that should have gotten them taken out a millenia ago. to join the thieves guild you simply walk into town with any loot in your inventory. keeping with tradition, bethesda has one animator and combat involves clicking until things die and nothing more. features such as crafting spells where replaced to make room for dlc for your xbox.",191.0
"i have only just got this game and it is amazing already. the storyline is very thought out and expressed. there are so many aspects of the game that you control that you could play the game 100 times and you would get a different expierience.",186.2
"pretty much the best in the series. immersive, entertaining, and something that most games today fail to capture. fun. if you have ever wanted to be a lizard that can shoot fire out of his wrists, you can. if you want to be a literal cat-burgalur, you can do that too. but just a warning, if you thought the hat the guy wears on the cover was the best hat in the game, it is acually one of the worst. why did they choose to do this? i dont know. but what i do know is that you should buy this game. now. but if you do get it, make sure to clear out a few weeks in your schedual, because you will not do be doing anything else. 11.5/10",39.7
"the world of skyrim is such an amazing place to explore and get stronger even without mods up the wazoo.",315.5
"i started the elder scrolls series since oblivion, so this is my 2nd tes ive played. i could say there are some improvement from the previous, like the atmosphere (i felt this game more fantasy-esque than oblivion), trigger event (how the guard react to your character, etc), and dragon and off course there are daedric missions which have its own background, and those missions give you reason to take and finish it. actually, daedric missions are my favourite part in this game, then there are main mission and faction/guild mission. apart from it, there are tons of mission, some are worth digging, some just bulls***. but that just elder scroll, it offers you a chance to explore an amazing world since it emphasize opportunities the player offered, those who cant bear free roaming game should avoid this game. you can gain a progress by just doing main mission, but you wont have rich experience, since it lays on the other mission or books, which will reveal how huge the tes world is. so if you searching for straight game, story dependent, and strong protagonist, ill advise to avoid this game",116.8
"love it! havent jumped into all the dlc yet but so far so good.",25.9
"i have been playing this game on the 360 for more than 300 hours and now ive purchased it here on steam so i can experience the mods for this game. onto the review, this game is just absolutely amazing, it has to be the most well done rpg currently, what i would say as an elder scrolls fan is that skyrim is much more streamlined than oblivion and morrowind, there are less skills and the levelling is system is much different, but more better than the previous installments. the pros of this game? like any other elder scrolls game, the world is beautiful, you would have to constantly stop every few minutes to view a breathtaking scenery, the games graphics is brilliant, though the faces of the characters are rarther stiff, also, killcams are a great addition. the cons? well, it mostly suffers from bugs but it can be fixed by using console commands (sorry console peasants!) and most of the npcs are rather bland, but nevertheless, this is a game that will truly immerse you for countless of hours, the dlcs are must have, too.",99.6
"really great game lots of open world to walk around in with npcs that dont feel like robots and there is a also lot of mods to add to do new stuff,get new weapons,new worlds and all sorts of things so i would highly recommend you buying this game",815.2
"honestly amazing open world with places to explore and things to see but the ending of the main quest was to easy for me",33.4
"seriously....youre even going to bother looking at the reviews for this game? why have you not bought this yet?? on a serious note, this game is a downright masterpiece in gaming. the world is enormous and about as detailed as possible. the graphics are great, the gameplay is addictive and extremely well-made. not one bad thing i can say about this game. so buy it. now.",74.7
"going through my game list i just saw that i have over 400 hours on this game. i dont understand, how this is possible. i havent even finished the main quest yet. barley began the quest line of the first expansion, and not even finished the starter quest of the second expansion. i have yet to fully explore skyrim. of the 8 holds (skyrim districts) i only explored 5 of them. i dont know how many more hours it will take me until i finished the main quest and the two expansions. how many more to see everything, but thank i godi took breaks playing this game. because if you play straight from start to finish, having maybe over 1000 hours of play behind you, you will be fluid in the ancient dragon tongue, recite the theme song from your memory and likely need a guidance consular to help you take your first steps back in the real world. so immersive is this game experience. in the years to come it wont be possible to take people serious that havent played this game.",401.9
"this game is an amazing expierience, the graphics, voice acting, and the items a so vast. this is a great game for people who are into rpgs. theres so many different choices you can make in this game, like be a sneaky stalthy character, or a hardy soldier in gear, or a sharpshooter with a bow. not to mention tons of weapon mods and character modifications like a new race. this game is one of my favorites because there is just so much to do.",207.2
"this game is badass! i first started playing it, and al of a sudden, i skiped 6 months!",149.5

"if you havent played this game, i feel sorry for you.",69.2
"honestly. without any mods at all, this game is a strong 7/10. it has the base for what is a great modding project. it has an engaging story that builds on a large catalogue of games worth of lore and backstory. it has a fair graphical setup, though it is shamelessly consolized. sound design is good and gameplay is solid. the game gives you a great ammount of freedom so that you can make the game into what you want. you can ignore the story completely and just forge your own story throughout skyrim, or spend hours just doing sidequests, or maybe just spend your gametime becoming the ultimate enchater. anything is possible. a fair game worth your time and money. but that all changes when mods enter the ring. when mods enter the ring this game becomes the jungle-gym of modern games. you can do anything you want. want to turn skyrim into a tropical paradise? theres a mod for that. want to turn all the dragons into characters from my little pony or thomas the tank engine? you can do that. you can even make skyrim into the most realistic looking and playing game ever (minus the dragons/mosters/spooky ghosts). with mods, this game is amazing. the game is your oyster in any way you want. and that is why you play it. summary: holy  this game is good. 10/10",425.8
"to date, this is still the most enjoyable and diverse game i have played, i have played around 10 different characters, 10 different ways of approaching quests (started in different cities), leveled different skills, and every character was a new experience, apart from the fact that you do the same quests, sometimes the order in which you do them, open up new quests, or you can do the actual quest itself differently which results in the outcome being different.",534.1

"ive had this game since it was released 11th november 2011. ive had it on ps3, xbox360 and now pc. ive had over 25 playthroughs at an estimate ive played around 600 hours. (i know theres people with even more) i cant remember ever feeling bored or not having anything to do. watchdogs is a brilliant game i played watchdogs for 5 days, completed all the story and most of the side missions. i got bored. im now playing skyrim again. i wasnt going to rate skyrim because, for it to be believable, i would need to find something wrong with it. so 9.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10 bye-bye ;)",129.9

"i cant say this hard enough. by far the best 1prpg i have ever had the pleasure to play. surprises around every corner. this game has a way of evolving around you at your pace. imo no other game does it quite this well. choice! if you have the means, i highly recommend it.",287.9
"best single player adventure game ever. theres a sea of mods to install too.",8.9
"in a game about building your character the way you want, you would think that the practically endless quests, plotlines and dungeons would have something meaningful at the end of each and every one. sadly this is not true - the dungeons all over the map at the best of times serve as waypoints for travel, and thats about it. there are a few plotlines that tie together, but the only quests that feel rewarding are the vampire / werewolf quests in the dawnguard expansion, the dragon priest masks, and the quests for the daedric artifacts / divines (possibly the dragonborn quests in that expansion, i havent bought that expansion). everything else is practically pointless. its great if you want a game thats free to fine-tune your character in, but if youre looking for anything else youll want to look elsewhere or to the modding community.",206.5
"absolutely amazing, the graphics, the storyline, the gameplay, and the mods oh god the mods!!! skyrim is an absolute 10/10 game, you wont get tired of it, and if you do then you can always get a mod that fixes that. very interesting dlcs and easter eggs are funny as f***. 9 million npcs 9 voice actors. youll barely even notice. buy this game naow",36.7
"best game iv ever played. all my hours are clocked up on the xbxo 360 with all of the acheivments gained!",15.1
"i found this game to be incredibly boring. great graphics, great world design, even fairly good characters characters dont outweigh the amazingly shallow combat mechanics. i wish they did because i was really hoping to enjoy this game, but sadly thats not the case.",5.2
"for once in my entire lifetime im going to be serious here. this game is neck-deep in bugs, the voice actors are overused to the point of where i get all too common irreversable headaches. the a.i. is completely ed and the combat system needs to be tweaked. with all the community support with mods this can and has been reversed on many levels, but knowing that bethesda neither had the time nor the funds to make this game the way they wanted, i can indefinitely say with no hesitancy that this game is no doubt the best game of the 2000s. there is no rating that can tell you how amazing this game is.",209.8
"after years of mate telling me to get this game i finally gave in and got it and not regretted it ok its a bethesda game which means its full of bugs but thanks to the modding community most bugs can be fixed and evan add a little extra to the game i highlly recommend if your in to rpgs get this game pros good storyline nice gameplay open world excellent modding community cons its a bethesda game (meaning buggy but thankls to the modding community i can get pasted that) thanks modding community i love you",53.6

"one cant simply pass on this game, its amazingly fun",44.9
"this game makes me forget to eat, sleep, and drink. buy it you want regret it, trust me",62.8
"score: 10/10 just, amazing! a must in any library! the ammount of content inside the game can easly make you run for hours! all dialogues are dubbed which is huge deal considering the ammount of content. the free dlc improved the graphics to a high standard and all the mods available in the community can increase replay time undefinitely, if one so does want to, and/or change the gameplay in so many different ways that i could not cover in this review. you can also dwel into your own mod and make your experience unique. the game provides you a pletora of quests, exploring and creature slaying for all tastes. i would recommend playing the game a while without mods because some of them can totally change the original feel of the game. if youre a veteran coming back to skyrim, you will find that they are a great addition for replay.",211.7

"amazing graphics, amazing enviorment, realistic characters, loving the freedom, combat is somewhat fun. game is an amazing rpg, one of the best ive played. combat could have been improved a bit to make it somewhat more varied and difficult. but great game nonetheless.",19.4

"ever since i played this game i now live in the basement with the same clothes. i have a full grown beard. all i eat and drink is barbecue chips with pepsi. i dont have a job. i am afraid to step outside. i cant do one push up. i have lost track of time and i have forgotten the meaning of life. i am carefree. i could never be happier. 10/10",39.2
"skyrim... this game is simply brilliant! i take it nearly everyone knows the famous tes series, the brilliant rpg games where we play a chosen hero from the ego perspective and save the world of tamriel from sheer destruction over and over again... skyrim is a brilliant addition to the series, with wonderful graphics a brilliant story and some awesome new systems compared to oblivion. however, a few of the favourite systems, such as the create your own spell have been removed to many peoples dismay, and spells now must be wielded as weapons, but they made up for that with dual-wielding and dual-casting ;d",258.4
"this game is rated 98% positive on steam. i wanted to be the 2%.",0.9
"love this game. bethesda youve done it again. i played oblivion. i played morrowwind. but skyrim? best of them all.",51.7
"the game is massive, entertaining, fun and filled with bugs and broken game mechanics. even though it represents another step away from the best game of the series (morrowind) i keep playing it because there is nothing else like it out there. dont get the dawnguard expansion, it ruins the game by randomly offing npcs during scripted random vampire attacks (why they decided to put those in there is a freaking mystery of galactic proportions).",271.5

"forest gump. star wars. lord of the rings. gone with the wind. there are movies that you should see because they are cultural icons that people will talk about for as long as we have a culture. if you dont see them, then youll sometimes feel like the clueless idiot in the room because references to them appear incessantly. now we have games like that. for this one, i must extend my scale. -2: do not buy -1: use caution 0: indifference 1: good for some 2: all must play 3: at least learn how to pretend youve played it, so you can save face. this game: 3",318.6
"its skyrim. you probably already know everything you need to know.",46.7
"one of my most played games. could not recommed it more. essentially its more emmersive than drowning in concrete, the random encounters range from the hairey to the hilarious and the content is quite frankly staggering. despite saying this i feel that no review could ever do this game justice. simply buy it, you will not be dissapointed.",99.1
"definitely recommend. ive done multiple play through with multiple play styles and it has never gotten old. the graphics are beautiful and a huge improvement since oblivion. while there are quite a few glitches most can be fixed with patch mods found on the workshop and nexus. the only real downside is that you have very few choices in terms of story; most quests do not have alternate endings and you cannot refuse quests.",503.1

"okay so first off, this is my first es game. i have to say, its soooo much fun. havent beat it yet, but here are my thoughts. +rich in lore +great art and design +great medieval/fantasy setting and open world +archery is fantastic, proabably my favorite aspect of skyrim tbh. +plenty of dungeons/quests -melee combat leaves something to be desired. different types of swings would be nice, ala dark souls -executions, which i cant seem to do on command -more enemy variety",280.8

"this game is awesome, but with lack of being able to deleting savefiles its less fun, and there is still some bugs where you can get stuck near a wall and cant move at all, that also make you using a cheat to get free from the wall.. and once you use mods you will get bored and stop play. well ive only played around 25 days in about 3-4 months time then i stopped because i cheated with the console., and that makes the game boring when you can actually cheat to get back npcs back to life, get any amount of gold, change your carryweight and more.. i even used the cheat from beeing stuck in a wall to actually go through walls at some point and then after that climbing the air and running towards places from high up in the sky.. and then i got lazy climbing a mountain and used the same code.. things got more and more boring.. otherwise its a very good game.. but next time bethesda studios please remove the cheat-console and please no mods, and please a button so you can delete your saves.. it would also be cool if we could name our savefiles too, so its easier to remember what we was doing at that point.. and please please add in option so you can actually tick off the annoying autosaving.. there is already a quicksave button and a normal saving option..",182.4

"one of the best games ever created. seriously, buy the game.",16.7
"this is by all accounts, an amazing game. even though its story does not match up to what its predecessor, oblivion had, it is still very good. the limit on what you can do in the game is virtually non-existent! also, there are hundreds of side quests you can do, some of them you can repeat. the 3 dlcs that have been released for the game, hearthfire, dawnguard and dragonborn also add a lot more. in hearthfire, you can build your own home from scratch, in dawnguard, you choose a side, and it has a lot of cool stuff. in dragonborn, it adds a whole new world! even if you dont want to do something in the game, you are not forced to (unless you count the opening quest)! this game is worth the price.",241.1

"this game is worth its money. the open world adventure skyrim never ceased to keep me busy. the core gameplay is good and a wide variety of choices can be made on how you play the game, whether you want to sneek around and backstab or go in gunsblazing is up to you. the main storyline is a bit of a grind making you run places but early on in the game it allows you to fast travel. the console commands are very easy to find making it an easy game to cheat. there are many factions that you can choice from to join. this game so far has been a highlight for me.",44.9

"it is indeed a good day for high adventure, but lets cut to the chase. dont buy it...yet. its a remarkable game, but the community will be getting tools in january that the devs use so the mod community will produce some truly genius additions. the 1.2 patch has bugged all the dragons and magic resistances, with hopefully a fix next week, as dragons are the topic of the day in skyrim. on the shiny flip side of this coin though, it may well be the only rpg youll ever need. if you rate fallout 3 as one of your favourite games, you owe it to yourself to try it. its more streamlined and varied than oblivion, making it a delicious combo of the 2. quests are easier to navigate and the variation in play style is remarkable. youre rewarded for your particular play style and the adventure suits whatever style you desire. my wizard has morphed into a sneaky wizard warrior with a springle of assassin and is alot of fun to play. longer review to come, but outta space :)",116.1

"the elder scroll v: skyrim will make you forget our world exists. create a character and become whatever type of character you want to be, assassin, thief, warrior, mage, werewolf, vampire... the list goes on. great replay value, this is the game to come back to when youre bored of newer games.",41.7
"this game... is fun. ive played better, and so have you. about the only thing that stands out for me in this title would be the intuitive crafting system, where its actually worth your time to spend time on it. however, that being said, this game is more of the same crap youve done in every other rpg youve ever played. everything from the go to point a to kill beastie to go to point b and get me a thingy. nothing about this game really screams innovation, and even the voice powers work so much like any other castable ability that it might as well be mandatory spell casting on the par of a quick cast ability in diablo. so i wouldnt suggest anyone spend 30 dollars on this title. you can spend a fraction of that and pick up oblivion, which has far better writing, exponetially better content, and have a game playable to the nth degree. whereas skyrim basically amounts to a graphical update to oblivion (all the tes games since morrowind use the same graphics engine, with upgrades between launches) without all the depth and immersion. so in short, i would not recommend anyone spend more than 20 usd on this title unless they are a die hard tes fan that simply must see the new content.",126.4
"i have been playng this game for over 3 years now, and it never gets old. its my favorite game ever. good job bethesda!",73.5
"a lot of people will tell you that you should play the earlier games first, but this is not true. i have fallen in love with this game and its many interesting characters. the graphics are beautiful, the quests are endless, and you can customize your own character. the only complaint i have are the repeated voice actors i sometimes recognize; a main character shares the voice of a trivial character which was weird to me. if you made such an amazing game, why didnt you just find some extra people to do some voices? in short, it is worth what you pay. there are endless mods that range from new quests that bring you to an entirely new land, to doing something as simple as milking a cow, and even to change the graphics quality should you get bored with the average scenery.",405.6
"combat is figuratively jerking off two extra long shlongs while you have the occaisional whip shlong, magic keeps the game fun for a long while, making people fly 100m away or shocking them until they start making glitchy creepy movements is always hilarious. graphics, they are nice, just could be a lot better. the perk of playing skyrim on pc, you can mod all the problems good bye. even combat, extra quests, bigger  all the work!",204.8

"you dont beat skyrim, skyrim beats you. skyrim is a near-endless rpg adventure, pick a direction and go and youll always find something interesting. while the combat isnt as refined as it could be the game makes up for it in sheer scale. i strongly recommend taking advantage of all the amazing mods.",413.1

"a good sandbox game held back from being great by clinging onto its elder scrolls baggage---and buggy engine. there is much to do even without mods, but the buggy, buggy engine sometimes wrecks things in a most-unfun way. that and the combat feels a bit clunky---fighting moving enemies in melee is awkward. bethesda could learn some game design tips from the saints row games, methinks. still a good game, but i would recommend waiting for a deep sale on it.",144.6
"absolutely excellent adventure game. not as much of an rpg as its predecessors, but still stays true to the elder scrolls lore and feel. the biggest drawback is the go here, kill that, pick that up, and bring it back feel to the hyped up radiant system. bethesda are forver making leaps and bounds in the audio/visual departments of their games but the writing could have been stronger, specially for the dark brotherhood side story and the companions quest line. several dungeons feel copy-pasted in their environments but what stray from the beaten path turn out to be absolutely stunning. bethesda have tried their best to remove back tracking from dungeons by adding frequently used shortcuts from the end rooms, which are useful when you reach the dungeon chest and are close to carrying capacity and need to sell what loot youve already hoarded. mods add a ridiculous amount of replayability to this game, just like they do for all other bethesda open world games, and with a very active community still modding over two years past release date youll never run short of silly, fun and even professional looking user-made content to renew your interest in this game.",298.7

"skyrim is a great game not becouse it is a great game out of the box but rather becouse it can be modded into somthing ejoyable for a great range of playing styles. its action rpg fighting system is good out of the box and can be tweeked to be great for various playstyle preferences. it takes some effort to make it into what you realy want to play but it is well worth that effort, you as a player do rarly if ever have to tweek anyting yourself you need but to subscribe to a set of mods that fit your needs even with minor tweeks who do not rely on oficial dlcs can make the game a verry difrent experience than the vanilla game i do feel for the poor console players who get but the vanilla and the dlcc. what makes skyrim so enjoyable is the descovery of other combinations of nonintrusive tweks that make the game or verry near to that game you always wanted to play but could not for it simply did not exist. it still do not, but you can tweek skyrim to verry enjoyable semblance of it.",213.5

"this game is just as great as it was 3 years ago, and with the contribution of the countless mods on the workshop and nexus, it is still way better than alot of recent games. it has an unlimited replay vaule with loads of different play styles, meaning there will be new stuff to find in every playthrough. 10/10 bring on elder scrolls 6!!!",200.2
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"this is a great game where you start out as a prisoner and end up a hero who fights dragons and saves the world form the baddest dragon of them all, alduin. or, you know, dont. the elder scrolls games provide an open world with so much content, you can play the game for 40 hours and completely forget the game even has a main quest (that was my first experience playing morrowind). i mean the main quest is great, but you can just go exploring. want to climb that mountain? go do it! want to go dungeon crawling? lots of them to discover and plunder. and the levelling system is pretty neat, too. but by far, the main appeal of this game is the exploration and openness of choices. if you played fallout 3 or new vegas and havent delved into the elder scrolls, this is a great place to start.",71.8

"let me just say, the 13 or so hours logged on steam are only the hours since i got my new computer. my old computer couldnt handle pc gaming, so most of my skyrim hours are on my xbox. with that out of the way, it is time to state the obvious. skyrim is one of the best games out there, even now at almost three years old. immersive environments and hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of gameplay mean that the snowy province in the north of tamriel feels truly alive. the world is almost seamless, despite a few graphical bugs (some of which are honestly hilarious though; it wouldnt truly be skyrim without them), and npcs are endlessly interactive. there are so many hidden locations and optional sidequests, it is nearly impossible to run out of things to do. and even on the off-chance that you do manage to find complete every single thing in the game, there is a vibrant modding community (something i didnt have access to on xbox) out there that does make the gameplay literally endless. ive never quite found another game that satisfied my need for open world, character-building rpg quite like skyrim. plus where else can i scale a sheer cliff riding a giant wolf wearing purple leggings? nowhere. a+++++",28.9

"for anyone is a big fan of fallout or any rpg this is for you",142.8
"really nice open world rpg with gorgeous nordic landscapes. the biggest downside is that quests and the charracters are a bit flat. i wish i would care when i kill some random farmer in the world, so i guess the immersion is lacking here. but you get distracted enough by other things that you kind of forget it. if youve played past elder scrolls game, expect the same experience, for some people its good, for other it isnt. most important thing : mod it, mod it, mod it. this game is day and night with mods and it fixes a ton of issues bethesda did not care to fix.",282.2
"skyrim has a pretty good environment and really nice ambient music. there are a few interesting quests involving the lore but most of the main quests are just go into this dungeon and get this relic or shout or whatnot. you would get a lot out of this game if you like exploring, even if there isnt much to do past looking at cool, varied landscapes. also, if you like modding scenes then this is worthwhile to look into. the steam workshop is really good and easy to use and if you want even more depth you can find more mods online. if its under $10 and youre an explorer or fan of modding then check it out, otherwise pass.",75.8

"this is, quite simply, the best game i have ever played, bar none. i have one, and only one, complaint about this game, and that is that i did not like the recycling of the same voice actors for different npcs. thats the worst thing that i can say about this game. what can i say that is good? aside from the good graphics, which seem to be what sells games, there is a coherent plot line, multiple plot lines, that can overlap and have some conflict. replayability is pretty good. it certainly beats any other title in the single player genre. i cant say enough good about this game, yet here i am, ending my review.",281.6

"one of my favorite rpg open world fantasy games! world is really big and just fantastic. i love the style and gameplay of this game. quests are really fun and you are never bored while playing. i really like the style of playing because you can play as warrior or wizard style. also there are skills/levels for character which you decide which one to upgrade. world is huge! fantasy level is normal because you can kill also normal warriors/people instead only monsters/dragons. story line is really sick! only the problem is on start of game because you need to walk a lot but later when you discover all the places and towns then you can use fast travel option. game also have a lot of side quests and hiden places to complete and discover especially if you buy legendary edition of the game then you have a lot of new quests. like i said, its one of the best rpg games so i reccommend this game to all rpg and fantasy lovers. game it totally worth of money! 9,5/10",74.2

"nice quests, nice design but game breaking bugs. i had 3 times problems with the main quest... had to restart twice and i lost hundreds of hours in rebuilding and replaying my character because of bugs. it is well advertised but i advice to buy only on special offers. i am forced to used god mode too often to enjoy the game",117.0
"normally i dont review games but due to an overwhelming amount of friends asking me if skyrim is a good game i feel the need to set some things straight. skyrim in a nutshell is one of the best rpgs that i have ever played simply because of its non-linearity. for those of you who may not know a linear game is one that simply lets you play through the story line with little to no side quest or free roam, which as you may have guessed is highly frowned upon by many. skyrim however is anything but you can fully customize your character, explore what you want when you want, gather followers who assist you in battle, and one of the greatest features in my opinion be what ever lineage you want to be. for instance with some video games your either good, bad, or neutral with little varience, but in skyrim you can be good bad or neutral at any given time due to the elder scrolls brilliant story plot, and a history so realistic you might even find yourself exploring the lore behind skyrim. but if i had to say the best feature it would probably be the four other games just waiting for you to explore, each revealing a different location in tamriel. spoiler: did i mention elder scrolls online? well if you didnt know already now you do :)",289.6
"well, to be quite frank i only have one sentence to describe this game. 10/10 would bang.",307.4

"graphics are amazing... great gameplay... and also awesome modding sstem!",21.0
"apart from all the hype this game receives, it is not that interesting. the story is not captivating, the combat is bland, and there is far to much traveling. as a person who loves shooters, games that focus on sword play leave a lot to be desired.",3.0
"saying this game is the best game ever is an understatement. seriuosly you should get it.",803.6
"one of the deepest rpg experiences ever and does the elder scrolls franchise justice, the story is creative and unique and excellent. combat isnt as deep as games like witcher 2 however its easy combat system allows for the game to be accessible to all. the modding community & scene within the game is amazing, if you are looking for a way to change the dynamic of the game or just a aesthetic change there will most likely be a mod for it, weapons, armor, quests its all there. the graphics are still quite good especially with the hd texture pack and combined with a enb the game looks glorious. its a must buy.",163.8
"hours of fun, so many different things to do in this game. i love it so much!",155.1
"this game will ruin your social life......trust me xd but to be serious, i have been a huge elder scrolls fan since morrowind and this is by far the most in depth es game to date and im loving every minute of it. i do have to say though, its pretty hard to kill dragons when half the town is on your butt cause you turn into a vampire lord to slay it xd i give the game 9 dragon souls out of 10 :)",97.1
"skryim is like an incredibly detailed and intricate mmo but without any other players. i mean that in a good way. other players ruined wow for me but they cant ruin this gem. my only gripe is that the main quest didnt seem suitably epic. in bethesda games the main quest always has the best voice acting and top notch interesting missions. in this game the side missions are a much higher quality causing the main quest not to feel as epic. when it ends it ends and the game just continues on. i like the finality of something like fallout or even morrowind where at least it isnt windy anymore. here your done and now the most interesting set of enemies in the game is no longer around for you fight. yay? overall id say its worth the 90 hours minimum your going to sink into this bad boy. just dont be a thief. bethesda games suck if you remove scarcity.",46.1

"this game has a lot of depth. there is so much to do, it will keep you busy for a very, very long time. and there are some quests with multiple choice options, so you can always go back and do those quests with a new character if you have the patience. i personally love this game, it is one of my favorites. i recommend this game to anyone who loves role-playing games and games with interesting storylines.",1.6
"hands down one of the best games i have ever played. the world has a lot of gorgeous locations and jaw dropping scenes for first time players, especially for those who love to explore. the game is large in scope and extremely immersive. on the rpg side of things, it isnt as deep as say morrowind or oblivion, but that can easily be remedied with any number of the fantastic overhaul mods u can find on the nexus or steam workshop. to add onto that, mods are a wonderful thing for this game. vanilla itself is enough to warrant a purchase from any real gamer, but sheer diversity and depths of mods that currently exist definitely add a whole new dimension to this game and the replayability is endless.",656.3
"holy  this game is good. go buy it and play it for 10 hours straight, youll realise that you have bearly scratched the surface of this amazing world. beautifully made structures litter the land. with so much to do, itll furfill your wildest dreams.",97.2
"fun game plus i added alot of mods to make it even better",237.5
"what can i say about skyrim... its a great fantasy game on its own, with plenty of hours of slicing, smashing, stabbing, casting, stealing, questing, cooking, reading, and exploring to fill your time. the real gem in skyrim is its mod community though, it adds hours and hours of content to the already massive game, making it definitely worth the money.",125.1
"to sum up this game in one scentense, its an epic adventure with great views, vast plains and deep caves where a vast myriad of different creatures. the graphic is great, its re-playable, it has mods in the hundreds that makes every game more or less uniqe. if your a fan of fantasy, this is a must have game, that inclued its dlcs wich only expands on the already awesome that is skyrim.",288.8

"probably the best elder scrolls game to grace this earth. what i like most is the game does not punish you for playing against your character build. i started as a heavy armor fighter but later became more of a rouge and the transition was practically seamless. try that in any other rpg! love this game!",134.1
"this is without a doubt one of the best games i have ever played. the storyline is great, and the side missions are fun. i really liked how you can create your own destiny in this game. there are many different play styles to choose from which tailor to many different types of gamers. the game is very immersive and offers a very deep experience. i could go on for days talking about how skyrim is a phenomenal game but i wont. just buy it.",50.4

"im late to the party here. very late. its... hard to get into for me. it took me several months to really get going, and even then i had to give myself a leg up with levels. i play for fun, not difficulty, and all that. it was honestly really dull until i found the mages college in winterhold. started doing that questline and i was honestly having fun. felt a little like a harry potter parody except were all grown ups. got some mods installed and did the companions questline, and now im doing general sidequests. i think main quest will be once every blue moon for me, but its actually somewhat fun now. might be because of a glitch causing me to run at a million mph though, i dunno. exploration is a nonissue due to that, and i can just nathan drake up/around mountains everywhere with it.",35.6
"its just a legend. every gamer must have a copy of skyrim.",55.2
"if you havent played this yet, you should! its the most amazing game i have ever played in my life. 10/10 well, only for those who like adventures and quests among a world full of dangerous creatures, bandits and dragons!",302.7
"this game suprisingly really cool! it really give me the feels that i really dive in in the world of skyrim,thanks to the open world system. the open world system for me is too open because i can steal someone belonging in the city and then they call me a thief,or just shout in the face of the jarl and suddenly i became their enemy,or just hurting the buffalos farmer,they will brand me with a bad title,but thats a great point of this game,open world. the story and mission is soo many,so for you who like exploration so much,i really recomended this game for you. ive been playing for 20 hours and still at level 13. all i did in that 20 hours is doing exploration,hunting down the dragons,and searching the power of shout the atmosphere really cool,but the music i think is too repetitive. overalll i recomended this game for player who likes rpg,adventure and action",30.4

"its a nice rpg with a huge open world, many details and (sort of) nice graphics, and its certainly very immersive at the first playthrough. the only problem i had was that many of the characters of skyrim werent that memorizable (if i think about it today). however, the game and its dlcs are certainly rpg-masterpieces which any rpg-fan should have -at least- tried +there are tons of mods (which are fairly easy to install -> steamcommunity) to enhance your experience!",554.1

"the first elder scrolls game i ever played was morrowind for pc, over the years ive played the subsequent releases on both pc and xbox 360. i think that these games are pretty much the best value video games or entertainment you can buy. the level of detail that goes into each is staggering, thinking about how much time and effort that goes into each new game is incredible. skyrim raises the bar and the sheer wow factor again with detailed lore, graphics, and tight gameplay. the feeling i got playing morrowind all those years ago returned the first time i played this, every turn in the road led to something new to explore. adventures are more fleshed out, and what starts off with one quest, usually ends up turning into a series as you play. this isnt even taking into account the workshop content that can be added by player creations. the one reccomendation i would have for people returning to the series or even thinking of playing this over again. i would say is that you should play it on at least adept setting, really - the harder you set the difficulty the more rewarding each battle can feel. skyrim for me lived up to the crazy hype train that it first rolled in on and more. theres just so much to the game as with most other bethesda games, it would be hard not to like it. skyrim for me is an easy 10/10",101.1
"this game is pure fun. the quests are indepth so you wont run of things to do or unlock anytime soon. also there is full player customization so who wouldnt want to be a fu**ing mage or a killer dressed like a crazy jester. you can kill anyone you want who isnt essiential to the story line for example you can kill a city guard but not the jarl of whiterun. also you can retire from adventure by buying a house and marrying someone or you can go out and make a name for your self in a good or bad way. 10/10",22.0
"i give this gamea 6/10. visuals are good for a bethesda game. story and writing are rather subpar, and the magic and combat system is not as good as morrowind. this is a decent game, however i reccommend morrowind for a much more challenging game with a far better story.",182.4
"if you want a really immersive experience, this is it. after spending over 80 hours in skyrim i have yet to touch at least two major quest lines or the dlc, get a character up to even half of the level cap, explore more than 2/3 of the world or get involved in crafting, npc relationships, buying land, building a house, etc. it feels like bethesda crammed more detail and extraneous systems into this game than fallout 3, new vegas and oblivion combined. yet the game is completely open-ended from the first 5 minutes in. is there a main story? kind of. good luck trying to follow it straight through without getting sidetracked for like 50 hours doing other stuff. ive played as a warrior tank, a destructive mage and a stealthy theif. one became a werewolf, by choice, and another became a vampire after getting bit in a fight. all this and i still feel like im just scratching the surface.",83.6
"what can i say, is a wonderful game. then with the dlc makes this game, even better today! i also know that at the beginning of 2013 will be released another expansion called dragonborn. so for lovers of skyrim, prepared to sharpen your knives! 10/10.",239.5
"skyrim... need i say more?... for those very very very few people who are unaware: brutal melee combat, magic of many flavors, the ability to do both at once, amazing graphics, amazing storyline, amazing character depth, amazing lore, breathtaking scenary, open-world, dragons, and lets not forget the amazing super cool ability to make a torch bashing naked argonian(lizard-man) that just boss modes, and the ever wonderful mod support!... probably so many more pros too little space to list them... so lets move on to cons: no co-op... seriously, thats it... tldr: if you do not own this game, buy it now. and if you do, buy it for your wife(seriously its that good).",189.2
"fun game and when your done with the main story line you can use the workshop to get extra stuff in yur game",181.0
"best game ever ! this was my first elder scroll game and from the very beginning i love it ! the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is great, but the best part of skyrim is the inmersion ! you can do whatever you want, be the main story or the sidequest, you will always have something to do. you can spend all day and not get bored in this game. the dlc are nice additions, although you already have enough content with the main game by itself. and if by any chance you get bored, theres always the mods community making news stuff ! when i cracked this game i liked this game so much that i bought it because its a masterpiece. its that good. seriously, stop reading this and go buy it and play it :) !",60.6
"one of the best single player rpgs game out there with an immersive and addictive environment. and being true to a real rpgs game you are given one thing that is rare these days for rpgs: choices that mattered, and ability to influence the outcome of the games and shaping the worlds around you. you can be do pretty much whatever you like by being a jerk and kill everyone or play a lawful good guy or somewhere in between. in short, it let you do what rpg supposed to allow people to do: role play. and it got a storyline easy to follow and engaging. only complain is the inventory system can do better. it seem quite clear it was designed for consoles system in mind somehow.",112.1
"this game is a masterpiece. with so many ways to play like warrior, mage ,assassin necromancer and plenty more. this is a downright flawless game with so much to do. this is by far my favorite game of 2011 and 2012 and one of the best open world rpgs made to date and goty for 2011. 10/10",137.9
"ive lost way too much of my life to this game. that said, id absolutely suggest that everyone else should do the same. skyrim spent quite a while in production, and it shows. the world is absolutely beautiful, and the gameplay is just awesome. if youre hesitant to spend the money, i assure you that its worth it; there are hours upon hours of content, and id say that it also has a good replay value.",194.0
"quite a good game in default. level scaling is not as much obvious as was in oblivion. for best playthrough, i suggest of using some overhaul mods which makes it perfect",447.8
"amazing game, love its depth, gameplay and story. simply amazing. 10/10. imagine how great would multiplayer be...",69.0
"i love this game, but the biggest irritation is when you dismount from your horse to fight, he runs away, or disappears, or whatever, and you cant usually get back on him until you get to the next town - its a pain if youve already transformed that day. otherwise, love it!",76.7
"100 hours of game play and i still have not started playing main story line",242.1
"horses climb mountains like goats 10/10 for horsegoats",123.5
"this game has almost everything. when you add the free workshop content, it can be anything! you can even make it into a game like the sims if you wanted to (though im not sure why you would want to). i dont have a lot of time on record but ive been playing obscene amounts on my xbox before i bought it for pc. thats right. its so good that i bought it twice.",134.9
"in the three hours i have played, i have made these great accomplishments: 1. ran away like a coward because i failed to sneak past an angry bear. 2. picked up a broom and suffered severe bloodloss. 3. got lost in the mountains and was killed by a giant. 4. visited an old man in a house and he set me on fire. obviously i have no clue how to play this game, but i still find it fun.",3.5
"as a guy who dislikes first person games and rpgs, i was pleasantly surprised with how much i liked this game. if you (like me) dont like rpgs, i advise you, endure the first hours and youll find yourself in a world full of great stuff. ps. theres an option to play in third person (for those who dont like first person pov) but it is not very good since the animations kinda suck.",83.7
"definetly worth the money get it for endless amounts of fun especially with the mods in the workshop.",78.6
"how do you not have this game yet? whats wrong with you? really? buy it now!",140.5
"best in series. would rank: #1 skyrim, #2 marrowind, #3 oblivion. never played arena or hammerfell. but love this game!",40.4
"amazing game that, when including mods, has near infinite play time value",501.7
"honestly one of the best games ive had the pleasure of playing. ive spent so much time with this game, and have yet to ever get tired of playing.",90.1
"an amazing game with an awesome story/stories. theres so much to do that you can easily put 150+ hours in without touching the main plots.",86.9
"one of the best rpgs so far i have spent well over 300+ hours on the xbox version, and the computer is just as good if not better!",109.4
"ive lost my marriage, my job, my kids all due to this damn game. i dont know if it was all worth it to be a dragonslayer, werewolf, vampire, half god, billionaire. but i know it was fun getting here for the most part.",321.4
"i love this game. it takes a little getting-used to if youre new to the franchise like i was.. there are a lot of systems which arent done in other rpgs. mastering things like using your quick slot and the open ended quests takes time, but its well worth it. very hard to find something negative to say about the game, but for the sake of constructive criticism, i will say this: the dlc content feels a bit rushed, and its the only place i encountered any bugs at all. particularly with the dawnguard expansion. buy this game, play the hell out of it. you wont regret it.",65.4
"very fun game, but at times it will close on me randoomly after a while of gameplay which really annoys me especially since its random. missions are linear, just go in, kill this, get some gold, youre done. combat is fun though, story line is interesting, and the mods are great.",371.1
"this is so ing addicting! great game, some minor bugs but due to its vastness completely ignorable!",89.5
"one of the best single player rpg ive played in my entire life",27.5
"although i am not much of a pc gamer, playing skyrim was one of the best decissions of my gaming career. a massive open world, so many choices, and some decent acting, as well as countless adventures that you can send your dragonborn on; what more could you ask for, dlc? well, skyrims got dlcs in spades. theres hearthfire, which allows for the adoption of children and the construction of 3 actual mansions that dot skyrims landscape. then theres dawnguard, which brings in a force of legendary vampire hunters and a group of true vampires. and finally, theres dragonborn, which takes across the seas, of the coast of morrowind, to the mysterious island of solstheim, which in itself, is a huge enigma. face countless enemies, find legendary treasures, and save tamriel from a rising terror, formed from legends and stories of heroes and brave warriors. are you of dragon blood, or are you a snibbling, whining milk drinker?! i give this game a 9.8/10, for shear creativity, decent acting, and such a broad world that you can explore. :d",230.2
"definitely the geatest game of 2011. 100% worth every penny for the amount of hours youll put into it.",114.6
"i have many more hours on the console. got this game the day it came out and have loved it since that day back in 2011.",22.1
"it says it needs to update but it wont ive tried all the stuff it told me to do but it dosent work untill it works i dont recomend this game on steam please help",13.4
"this game is worth the money and your time. bored? you will never run out of things to do with this. plus, there is always mods you can resort to.",50.2
"what can i say that hasnt already been said about skyrim? just buy it already if you havent.",274.3
"compared to oblivion this game isnt as good. skyrim you would think being the latest open world installment in the series would be the most unlinear, unpredicting, and most rewarding yet. sadly it falls short of those three aspects! the game puts you down the same path over and over, the battles are actually boring, the loot has no real feeling anymore. i feel like everytime i play i get bored very quickly, even with mods this game just does not feel like es. the elves now look like aliens... argonians look less like lizardmen and more like something you would find as an enemy in a swampland. i bet half of the people that have played this game didnt even realize there is a civil war going on! morrowind, oblivion, play those.",279.4
"one of my favorite games ever. great graphics and alot to explore in the huge world. definitely a",96.8
"it certainly is dumbing down compared with oblivion and especially morrowind, but its great if you dont want to use intelligence and just want to have fun. use an xbox controller for the best experience.",275.8
"quite possibly the most fun i have had with a video game. the open world model, radiant quest system, and easy modding gives the game vitually endless playability. the community support around the game can help even the greenest of players past any potential glitches. kudos to all involved.",1156.1
"prepair for a game like no other, as you embark on a great quest to reach the cloud district and prove nazeem wrong. then attempt to kill him for mocking your entire life, and instead end up battling endless guards; thus racking up a bounty high enough to buy all of skyrim and destroy the thalmor forever. and once you do this, you might even be interested in playing the main story line.",140.0
"skyrim is the best game ever. no, thats it. its like tes4 except beefier and macho-manier than tes4. buy it breh.",1.8
"this game is amazing, go buy it now if you can. you can do basically annything. wanna raid a town? go ahead. wanna download random weapons and stuff off the workshop to create even more in the game go ahead. wanna murder a king as an asassain? go ahead. the list is endless, buy it and have fun for an eternity. this is a great game for anyone that likes a rpg, fps, or action. the conclusion is its great, and you can go beyond your wildest dreams with or without the dlc. its just a good fun time. i higly recommend this game above all others this is a 10/10 - its a masterpiece that has stood the test of time these last few years.",115.3
"skyrim is anawesome game. it is set in a medieval time with mythical monsters such as dragons, orcs, and elves. it is full of places to explore and battles to fight. start an adventure in the middle of a huge civil war between two huge groups of people, the imperials and stormcloaks. stop the dragon uprising and bring peace to skyrim.",127.0
"one of the best games ever. 10/10 would reccommend to anyone who enjoys open world rpgs.",428.6
"extensive game with great graphics and storyline. you can spend +100 hours playing this game, and still havent seen everything.",177.8
"10/10 best butterfly catching sim ive played in a long while.",26.7
"this game is awesome and provides hours of entertainment. it is well worth the money, buy it!",229.0
"absolutely the best adventure rpg out there! this game is open world and has lots of free will. go where you want when you want. want to do a quest or not, the choice is yours. slay dragons and save the people or become a thief or vampire. the graphics and world size are simply amazing. the setting is medieval with realistic design. the clothing, weapons, buildings and environments have a lot of detail. the music in this game is just addictive. its relaxing when youre just wandering around and gets upbeat and epic when battles start. you can download the soundtrack on itunes. one of the best things about his game is theres soooo much to do! ive been playing this game since it came out and im still playing with my original character. its like theres endless quests to do. if you like medieval adventure games youll love this game!",204.8
"skyrim is a nice game compared to most other games, they just dont capture the essence of gaming a skyrim does. the good things about skyrim is the completely crazy game mechanics, and the great textures, then the ability to go from bird-watching, to epicly fighting a dragon without just being weird like some games, i think the idea to put the dragonborn song when fighting dragons just makes sense, talking about dragons they are awesome sauce! the nordic ruins cant be more fun to get a good fight, and they have some good loot as well, i like the fact that most the loot is not in just one pile, its spread around you have to look for it, i like the immersion it gives. so i give skyrim 9-10 stars! why not 10-10 stars, well i wish you could create your own magic like oblivion, with better balancing. and the magic is not a good as a sword why? what would take a lot a fireballs to kill a giant it might take 3-4 hits with a sword to kill, not entirely balanced.",304.3

"amazing open world game!!!u can discover a new world out there as a dragonborn...worth to buy $$$$",276.0
"skyrim is simply the most amazing world editor game you can play. its exactly what a hard core game wants. the game isnt about fantasy or slaying dragons at all forget that , its about spending hundreds of hours configuring and reconfiguring .ini files and debugging why boobs dont bounce right or why physix mods cause horses to fly during the opening credits. i wanted to create the most beautiful, perfect, real world experience, before starting out my quest. 155 hours in and 100 mods deep i created my perfect experience then i got all the expansions and broke the mods and look forward to going thru it all again! im serious when i say i get more satisfaction tweaking a game then actually playing it. skyrim is aging like a fine wine.",155.5
"love skyrim. enjoy having characters with different builds and specializations.",178.1
"a amazing game where you are totaly free to kill monsters, do quests, make armor, and lots of more! you have a lot of levels to reach and unlock new skills, earn more health stamma or magic. the character which is dragonborn is a amazing thing. he can learn shouts which does really good damage on monster or animals. the dlcs dragonborn, heartfire and dawnguard is the best experianse of the skyrim gameplay. dragonborn where you can tame dragons and ride them. hearthfire where you can make a house and lot of more. dawnguard where you can become a vampire do a lot of more quest and have lots of fun. it can be difficult but thats just in the start. once you have reached more levels the game will be the best thing in your life. you cant stop playing this game. i recomend this game 8/10 without any dlcs but i recomend the game 10/10 with the legendary edition.",113.6
"i hear the other games are good too, but i cant get bored enough with this one to buy them. i cant get out. i cant get out.",449.2
"ive had skyrim for years for the xbox and then i got it on pc and some people will think theres no difference between the two but the pc version has so.. much more to offer than xbox you get to use consol commands to cheat or as i like to do thake awsome! screen shots that display when i click the game in my library also you can get mods that enhance the game and also you can even get better graphics and performance with pc (depends on specs) so the question your asking should i buy this? i say yes! its the best game thats also the oldest and is now at the top 5 of my library so get out your wallet and adventure your way to pure happyness",121.6
"skyrim is simply the best game created not just in the tes series i have just bought it on steam and an restarting it again even after over 400 hours played on my xbox 360 i always find new things to do and places to explore. have to say best bang for your buck i have ever got and is worth buying twice just to have it on pc as well.",73.3
"still one of the most epic games i know. a lot of different ways to: - develop the character - fight - finish quests - recreate the world with help of the community add-ons - breathtaking sites more than 150 hours invested in this game, cant be a coincidence :)",159.5

"doesnt live up to its potential, bethesda getting lazy and figure they can cash-cow the elder scrolls series.",104.3
"personal rating: 9/10 replayability: so much. budget: worth it. lenght: weeks. months. years. skyrim is an elder scrolls game. this should be enough of a review. the elder scrolls titles have always managed to live up to their contemporary titles, and often taken the lead. graphics, good gamplay and an immersive world are just some of the incredible things that skyrim offers. its disappointing to see that bethesday didnt manage to implement many of the things fans have been asking for that got left out of oblivion, but i guess a big fat paycheck is enough success for some game companies. if my review seems negative, its because i know writing a review for this game is pointless. its one of the most well-known titles in the world, so i find it better to focus on the downsides of this otherwise great titles. the reason its 9/10 is because i cant give more to a game that relies so heavily on player-added content to be truly enjoyable.",223.6
"excellent game. tons of mods that can add infinite numbers of hours to the game.",591.0
"the gratest rpg of the world. the map is gigantic and there is so much to see that you cant believe it. you can do what ever you want in skyrim for example - the main quest - other quests( e.g. for a guild ) - marry - or just visit new places all in all skyrim is epic!!!",369.7

"its shiny, its fun, its very, very moddable, and theres no denying that bethesda pulled out all the stops on this one. my lasting impression however is of a visually grayscale world, a soundtrack that is lovely but not memorable, and a linear and uninteresting story. i wont go so far as to call it a disappointment because i do enjoy this game, but there is still no contest between this and oblivion for me.",36.3
"this will be a big hell yes! if you like either of the previous games (morrowind or oblivion) you probably already have, beat, possibly more than once, and may have aleady done so with skyrim. if not, then even if you have not played the others its a great and fun game. both first-person and third-person available on the fly and each has its merit. loads of hours of entertainment (plenty of things to just distract you or engage you) and can be played so many ways. that is all before you even attempt the tons of user created mods found on the steam workshop, skyrim nexus, and other places as well as if you want to mess around with the creation kit yourself. if you get this (with or without the dlc) then you are getting a huge game. also, dont forget the free hd textures they offer as dl as well. for those looking for a number then here you go - 9.5/10 (9.5 just because i enjoyed it so much that i wanted more). enjoy and enjoy some more.",35.4

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim, the fifth game by bethesda, set in the snowy northern province of skyrim in tamriel, is perhaps the best game by bethesda to date, and arguably the best rpg fantasy game. as the dragonborn, the player is set right in the middle of a civil war, coupled with the return of the mythical and powerful dragons. in this game, exploring is the main goal for the player. the presence of a main, overarching plot is placed among other quests and stories within the world. one can choose to follow the main story, or wander off in another direction entirely, tackling new quest lines and minor quests at the players pace. truly, the expansive world has much to offer players, from hunting and gathering, to random encounters and new quests. skyrim continually impresses with the amount of depth in the stories it tells and the dynamic skill levelling system. though there are still bugs present, they dont have enough of an impact to affect the game drastically. skyrim is well worth playing and will keep you engaged well after the 100th hour of gameplay.",461.3
"ive put enough hours into this game to know its worth every cent of its purchase price and more. i cant stress enough what a classic, fun, and fulfilling experience this game is. if you havent already bought it, youre missing out! id recommend the dawnguard expansion, for me flying around skyrim lifting giants of their feet and throwing them around, was a wonderful experience. get the legnedary edition if you can.",244.9

"safe to say this is one of the best games out there if you like adventure and magical storytelling. i loaded this with mods like climates of tamriel, vanilla nights, real rain, hd textures and purewater. its stunning on ultra!! allthough im not a fan of medieval kind of games, skyrim really sucked me in and i love to explore this game. it only gets better and better :) you should play this!",132.4

"this game gives you a new look in life... well, what im sayin is, you wont wanna join reality ever again! skyrim is the best game i have ever bought and i highly recomend this game to people who need a... change of scenery (i guess you could call it that). you can chose between humane, elven and beast races, a fair amount of hairstyles and colours, ranges of eye colours, armour, clothing, personalitys and likings. you can use this game for so many things, such as, roleplay, adventure, just to muck about on, testing mods, getting quests done, and... alot more! once again, i highly suggest this game, for it may change youre perspective on reality.

"skyrim basically stole ayear or so of my life. i first played on my cousins xbox, shortly after i got my own copy for the xbox. i mustve played at least 600 hours on the xbox. i got it for the pc because of the mods, (and better graphics, plus it was 3.74 in the sales) and im happy i did. it might not be for you, but it certainly was for me. why did i like it? i loved the freedom it had, the start gets a tad annoying (after playing through it thousands of times). but once you get past the start you are free to act like aidiot, murderer, theif, mage, knight, normal guy, or whatever you want. obviously theres an emphasis on killing, but im sure youd want to smash up the wide variety of enemiesthat there are. your race only really makes a difference at the start, because once you really get into it the skills are put into the path you want to follow, meaning you can really shape your charactor into who you want to be. mods skyrim has thousands of mods, and if you get nexus mod manager theyre really easy to install. there are some silly ones (turn dragons into thomas the tank engine), some serious ones (cant think one but there are), some u.i. ones (skyui), and many others",46.8
"this game is alot like pokemon. you make your way to a city and after a series of trials you are awared lydia, your first follower. you can level up and get armor for your lydia and let it fight other people. you can also trade your lydia for another follower with diffferent skills. lydia herself has no skills except almost getting killed several times a quest making her a good distraction. adopt a lydia today and she comes with a free set of gear tand ons of room to carry around the crap you want to keep but dont want to have in your inventory.",15.5

"really i doubt you need me to tell you everyone loves this game. and for good reason its kinda great, it may be buggy as hell but i think it adds some charm to it. at the very least their is just that much more to talk about with it trading werid stories of random funny bugs that happened to you. this game of course like all elder scrolls games have that you can just wander around and find adventure/quests/intersting things to do with out even looking for it. not to mention all the amazing mods people have created for it.",318.5
"this game has a rich story and buetiful lore, with a great moding community. you can play for hours getting lost in the missions and get side tracked along the way. my suggestion to new players is this, you should explore the workshop to find some intersting graphic enhancers and gameplay modifiers to improve on the organily great game.then procede down the main quest line and never say i shouldnt do that random thing up ahead. because youll regret not finding that map location to fast-travel to, and its fun to pick up some extra loot. all in all its a magnificently addictive game and a great adition to the elder scrolls series.",208.9

"well, this game is like all the other elder scrolls games. my only gripe is that theyve simplified some of the features in transitioning from oblivion, and some of the dungeons feel like a straight shot and not maze-like how they were in oblivion. other than that, great addition to the elder scrolls series, workshop has added a ton of content for the game.",215.6

"most of the achievements are attainable through normal play; theres only a few you might not discover on your own through thorough world exploration. combat is gimmicky and takes some time to get used you; you can sidestep that by going destruction to help get you embedded in the game before tackling a major learning curve. crafting mechanics are super-dull; these can be updated with mods if youre inclined. the game took me about 130 hours to finish all-in including most (but not all) of the side content; about 2/3s of the way through, i was totally, thoroughly bored of destruction and started to switch things around--the difficulty level is basically static over the course of the game, so its easy enough to switch play-types mid-game or even late in the game. the game has several bugs, some subtle and some quest-breaking. these can be gotten around through console commands you can find through google searches, sometimes by resetting quests, sometimes by turning collision momentarily off. requires some patience and tenacity since they really only come up in sensitive moments. still, skyrim is immersive, open, and beautiful. recommended.",154.7

"i love this game enough to not quit it even when it break my characters with the various bugs occuring if you download a mod interfering with the game. ...and that says i either got a problem or the game is just too good. joking aside, to me its only worth playing if you switch to master or legendary difficulty since the game is too easy on the other levels. the difference is that on all the others youd slay a dragon with no problem and on legendary youll run for your life. :d",320.9
"my character, hope, achieved more things than i had in my life, in a span of 3 years (in-game). being an assassin, a thief, an arch-mage, a werewolf, a companion, and a dragonborn, is freaking awesome. game of the year? no. game of the generation. 100/10",110.8

"im sure everyone has played this game, and if you havent, what are you doing with life? i played this game for hours straight and still continue to play it every now and then when i have time to kill. like oblivion however, the game does tend to get a little boring after a while but its the type of game that after waiting several months, becomes addictive again. 8.5/10",52.4

"this is one of the greatest open world games of all time. bethesda is a master of building a breathing world with some decent combat mechanics, always interesting story-lines. im not sure it quite reaches the heights of oblivion or fallout 3, but damn if it isnt a really good time all the same. if you like this game, be sure to go play fallout 3, and try out oblivion. oblivion may feel a bit dated in ways but its an incredible game as well.",107.9
"bloody brilliant, especially when modded. i cannot recommend this game enough! buy it, but be sure to learn how to add mods via the nexus mod managing tool and website, etcetera first as they fix and allow so much more from the game which inevitably makes the whole experience 100% better.",334.6
"i never...ever enjoyed elder scrolls, i have played the first game to this game and i could never get into or hooked on them but by far i am hooked on skyrim!, and the epic youtube rap that goes with it! this game has everything an rpg player looks for. intense battles where quick decisions always need to be made and of course...dragons! nothing like slaying a giant dragon and then sucking up its soul. but along with dragons there are tons of beasts and other humans / creatures you run into in this game and just so your not always alone in towns all over skyrim there are plenty of people willing to assist you whether it be by payment or simply delivering a letter. i recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good hack and slash, spell blasting, bow shooting good ol time. 10/10 in my book!",97.8

(did they even play their own game?!) and of course they have yet to fix them ... i think they never will.the game gives you freedom on the sole purpose to hide the fact that has no story to tell except maybe 4 quest lines (~2 hours worth of gameplay).now that the price has dropped (or even better if you find in on special offers ) i would recommend it as a good way yo kill your time but nothing more .",112.0

"if you have not yet tried an elder scroll game, this installement of the series is without a shadow of a doubt going to surprise you by the freedom it offers to the player. the fifth title from the legendary series, skyrim was anticipated ever since it was announced a year and a half prior to its launch and has evoked an amount of hype that only a few games can match. for it to have delivered to such expectation from the gaming community is unprecedented, in fact more people have started to use diappers for this game than world of warcraft. believe in the hype and all the positive review on the internet because if you call yourself a gamer, you ought to try at least one elder scrolls game before you die, as those games deserve to be displayed in your library and demands to be played and re-played as the among of content that they boast makes them worth at least twice or three times their purchase price. this being said, skyrim has set the bars extremely high for the rpg genre which is why in my personal opinion this game deserves a 10/10 - legendary!",277.5

"skyrim is a game i would recommend to all players it has amazing graphics a good story and plenty of fun and dangerous quests to play through. the beggining is no different from most elder scrolls since once again the story starts with you being in prison or arrested. but past that skyrim opens you to a new world full of caves,dungeons,cities,camps,and houses all throughout the world. but i also have problems with the game since th pc version is very glitchy. i sometimes take armor off a armor stand and put new armor on it then come back to see the old armor has duplicated replacing the armor i had put on there. you might think oh you now can give that armor to your followers or sell it! but this happens nearly everytime you leave your house and it is very frustrating. the game also glitches on quests causing me to go back to previous game files which is bad and is something that needs to be fixed. but in all skyrim will always be one of the best games to ever be made. i have never seen any game like it and never will. 9/10",65.4
"playing this game without 2k - 4k texture replacing mods and no enb preset should be a crime. playing skyrim in 2014 with no mods at all is just wrong and sad, really. also, be ashamed of yourself if you havent ever configured an .ini file. lastly: never ever clean your skyrim.esm when using tes5edit, nor shall you ever use k enb without having an sli/crossfire setup (except if you have a 980, then you may squeeze more than 30 fps)",406.6

"get it, youll have no regrets. ive been playing it since 2011 on ps3 and had beaten it 3 times. i returned a year after and still found the experience just as good as my first run of it. now with legendary mode veterans like me can play the game in a completely new style - e.g. exploring more of the features/professions/secrets which you wouldnt really use in normal run just to survive. ~ 10/10",95.1
"i know many many people will be against my perspective about skyrim... but you made me play 2 hours of really boring  besides fighting a dragon which was cool... but then you made me climb this big  mountain. when i got to the top i found a bunch of monks and they taught me to shout ro! boo haaa. this mixed with the port to pc feel leaves me with little desire to play this game. if you played 300 hours of oblivion their is no rreason to go here. graphics are better but that is about it. however the quality of the game is great, great polish... for me story is everything, im sorry skyrim doesnt quite hit the mark in that department.",24.5

"got boring quite quickly, modding community has alot to offer but the game itself wasnt very entertaining i found more enjoyment exploring and doing side quests than playing the main story",99.9
"buy it now you can do anything you want like get married go fight dragons go talk to poeple and the game is more than 500 hours to beat the full game!",16.0
"theres a huge world to explore just past the 29.99 fee",97.0
"excellent storyline(s) with tons of gameplay, and the legendary edition is worth the extra $20. you may have heard that this game has a lot of bugs, and thats true, but they actually can make the game more fun. miraaks a , by the way. just thought id warn you.",412.6
"you know, my friends joked about this being a game where you rim the sky, but there probably is a mod for it out there... somewhere.",45.2
"why are you reading this review? buy this game, get mods, have fun!",137.5
"best game ever!!!!!!!!! buy now. i bought the legendary edition and it adds so much more cool stuff like vampires and that you can ride dragons!!!!!!!!!!! buy now. you wont regret it.",259.9

"very simply put , the best game ive plaed in years. there is somthing here for just about everyone. so many hours of enjoyment for the money invested , the best bang for you buck on steam. this is a must have!",241.0
"while the base game alone is one of-if not-the best rpgs that has been released to date, having the pc version makes skyrim 100x better. mods add so much replayability to the game, though i would suggest beating the game with no mods first. i would recommend using skyrim nexus to mod, as it comes with an application that makes modding a breeze. currently, i am running almost 60 skyrim mods and the game is completely different. ultimately, there is no reason to not pick up skyrim, especially with the frequency of steam sales. along with the amazing story, there is just so much to do in the game. i have a bad habit of getting sidetracked on small quests/exploring caves when i set out to do one of the major story arc quests. the dlc is also very good, and definately worth a buy. i would really recommend putting the legendary edition on your wishlist and waiting for it to be on sale for like 50% off (christmas and summber both have amazing sales). you can pick up everything for ~$20 or less then. if you enjoy a pure rpg with an excellent story, with the ability to add thousands of player made mods of your own choosing, skyrim is the game for you.",265.6
"a very fun game, and good one to play if you are sick of playing skyrim legity on the xbox 360 and ps3 and dont know how to mod games as you can easily get the mods from the steam workshop",145.5

"probably one of the best games ive ever played. even though it is a little old, it still is a great game. skyrim has a lot of things to do other than the main quest line. plus there are mods that adds even more content to the game. would game again 10/10",73.8
"the game is fantastic! there really isnt much to say if you even know bethesda softworks and the elder scrolls franchise is.",64.0
"this is likely my favorite game of all time. fantastic out of the box, and with mods from the skyrim nexus (preferable to steam community) you can breathe constant new life into it whenever and however you want. the modding community for this game is still going very strong, if not stronger than ever, since its release three years ago.",505.4

"one of the best games of all time, hands down. bethesda churns out another epic and exceedingly large tale set in a very open world. with the immense support for modding in the community, skyrim can stand out as one of the most beautiful games imaginable. the modding community itself is a testament to bethesdas greatness, in being so supportive of community content. this support enables new content from the modding community that enhances bethesdas world and offers many improvements and innovations the original vanilla game could not offer. even if the game is played vanilla, without any modifications, it is a beautiful game, full of wonderfully written lore and story.",898.1

"this is a trully awesome game. 10 stars across the board and here is a list of reasons why. 1. huge and trully epic free roaming world to explore with awesome graphics. 2. great voice acting and story. 3. great combat system. 4. creation kit for modding your own alterations and additions to the game if you have the know how or wish to learn. 5. workshop and nexus to all the mods you could possibly think of for adding armor, weapons, dungeons, skins, graphic enhancements, and player homes or castles to the game. you are only limited by your imagination or your the power of your pc and graphics cards.",530.1
"by far the best version of the game and with all the mods in the steam workshop you will lose days in this great fantasy world",134.7
"in short this game makes me believe games can be great again. a feast for the eyes on its own and with the talent of great modders everywhere it gets even better. highly recommended.",1148.6

"a wonderful game and a true testament to the elder scrolls series. not as big as my beloved daggerfall or arena, but complete immersion into the environment is still possible. an easy to use skill system (though i do miss the in-depth ones of old) and a great character generation system make the game easy to play your way. above all i love the customizability of the game itself, leaving it to the end-user to shape the game as they see fit. a great and immersive set of stories to go through, with dlc expanding it to many hours of enjoyable fun. this is by far one of the greatest games that i have ever played, and continue to play!",78.5
"i bought this game when it came out and i just recently started playing it again. its become like gaming comfort food...every so often you can come back to it and its familiar and just as good as you remember. ill keep coming back to it with a couple mod additions and it should keep me going until elderscrolls vi, whenever that happens.",297.7

"far better than oblivion, without question. still some things i like better about morrowind but this is definitely a great game.",251.4
"amazing game and the moddability of it gives it exceptionally high replayability.",1149.8
"i have poured many hours of my life away into this game, and it is still one that amazes and intruiges me. i would never not recommend this game; if youre a fan of the elder scrolls saga, you should have bought it already. if youve never played an elder scrolls game before, this is a great one to come in on, as the graphics are crisp and beautiful and the storyline is deep and engaging. a must buy for western hack n slash rpg fans.",216.3

"the elder scrolls 5: skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played. it contains everything a basic human needs: food, sleeping, and murdering. you can do nearly anything you would like, including murdering everyone in a town! except important characters... which is a bummer... but anyways, skyrim also has extensive character development systems. if you want to be a mage, be a mage. if you want to be a mage who also uses a sword, then be a mage who also uses a sword! enchant weapons and armor, be a blacksmith, have a family, become the thane of a city, lead the stormcloak rebellion or end the stormcloak rebellion, climb giant mountains, do anything! this game gets clawwws personal 10/10!",91.1

"i highly recommend this bootiful game for soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many freaking reasons i love it",67.1
"why cant i stop playing this game?!? ill tell you why, because it has great writing, good graphics, and an immersive quality the likes of which ive never seen. the dynamic music system always seems to keep the right tone at the right time just like a big-budget movie. just dont rush from pointer to pointer. take your time. light up the dungeon with a torch or candlight spell and take in the artwork.",444.3
"such a great game, even without mods. mods make the game so much better though.",51.8

"when i first installed the game it didnt work properly (i played in a tiny screen in the top left and i couldnt install mods) after a couple of hours of work i fixed the problem and i started playing. i became addicted immediatly. its a great game with great graphics. its certainly worth the cash. only thing is that the ui doesnt work very well (randomly closing etc) but thats what skyui is for.",101.0
"just an all around great game! its good on so many levels. i just recently got it for computer. i used to play on ps3 and spent countless hours on it. now that i have it for pc i got the game to look how i always wanted it to look like. the immersion in this game is phenomenal!",100.5

"prepare to experience your new obsession. -bethesda, on daggerfall, 1996. nearly twenty years of development and gaming granduer have brought us to this point. since we first saw arena in the early 90s much has changed, but one thing has remained constant... you dont play an elder scrolls game, you experience it.",226.8

"incredibly good game and with the addition of all the readily available mods, a truly must have rpg.",69.5

"a very deep rpg, with a large game world to explore. with most of the bugs worked out of the latest version, theres not really much to complain about.",100.9
"great ting about the game is all the side quests wich add so much more into the game and unlike most other games you can keep on playing and not get bored easily. it also looks great with very few glitches and amazing graphics",341.4

"best rpg ever. seriously, it knocked out xenogears from my #1 spot.",90.6
"one of the best games i ever played...this game is amazing, the texture and the graphics are bad, but this is not something that should bother me. this game is a whole world, you can do anything in this game, the dlcs are amazing too. and if you like rpg, magics, fantasy and a huge lore, this game is for you.",133.2
"i waited a few years before i picked this up in a steam sale but it actually suprised me as fantasy rpg games have never really stiffened my . i enjoyed the magic, weapons, herbs, spells and general task management of the game. graphics are pretty good. my only complaint is that you cant fight in armies and dungeon raiding soon gets old. worth a punt if leather and burning people turns you on.",52.0
"my favorite game of all time. this game is a must-have, best game ever. 10/10. if you havent experienced the true epicness of this game, you havent lived.",11.2

"173 hours in and i still havent finished the main quest nor picked a side in the war. damn you nexusmods!",174.0
"an awesome open world where you do whatever the hell you want. you can do the main quest, do sidequests, or heck, do no quests at all and just kill loads of bandits and forsworn! the characters are flexible: you are not restricted to a specific playstyle as your characters skills level up as you use them. loads of content, and if you get the dlc, loads more content! overall, fastastic game. when this game is on sale, it is definitely worth your money!",101.3
"i like it. cant play it right now because i modded it too hard, but its a good game, aside from the poor optimization.",221.4
"giant rat ran up to me. giant rat bit me. crushed giant rat to death. felt bad. exited game. closed steam. shutdown computer. cried. 10/10 would go on emotional rollercoaster ride with giant rat again",39.4

"skyrim is probably one of my favorite games. i have played it on the xbox, ps3, and pc, and all i can say is... wow. the game is great ; it has an awesome plot, graphics, and interesting mods. because however, i have played it on different consoles, it is annoying to have to restart, and then proceed to get through all the cutscenes and quests i have completed so many times before. but time and time again, i find myself dealing with the struggle and continuing where i left off previously, and strangely enjoying every minute of it. this game has a few flaws, but if you like rpgs, get this game now! 9.5/10",38.1
"i personaly love this game, it was worth the $50 i spent on it when it first came out steam, and the introduction of mods caused the customizability of the game play and astetic to jump, its worth the money",1387.6

"undoubtedly my favourite ever game, with surely unmatched expanse and diversity while still keeping every single one of your favourite rpg elements. a must-have for any open-world lovers like myself. even if you (for unexplainable reasons) you dont like the way skyrim is...well, you can at least pump it full of mods!",537.4
"i had been playing this game for years on my xbox360 and when i got it on pc it was a new game. with mods and better graphics, even on a smaller screen, it is a way better experience. this game gets a 9.7/10 as vanilla, but with mods this game is easily a 10/10.",10.3
"a substitute for oblivion, skyrim scratches the elder scrolls itch with some improved features to oblivion such as better combat, lore, and graphics. the only sad part is that the dark brotherhood quests were lacking and there is no arena, but that does not mean this game should not be played. one can easily spend just 20 minutes on this game and rack up a plethora of quests. a great sequel.",273.2
"i recommend this game because you feel like a guy who can p0wn, be a warrior and also be in the mideivel times ( and download epic mods )",67.5
"this game is absolutely worth every penny, if you like to shred  with bows, swords and magic well this game will fulfill your every desire for pillaging and plunder.",130.4
"one of the quinessential western rpg:s in my opinion. it has so much to offer, and the game should last from anywhere from 10 to 20 + hours of gameplay depending on how you go about it.",139.3
"what a awesome game the map size the stroyline(s) the gamplay all excell beyond expectaions and also the communty input in this game is amazing! however there is one nag that is the devs seem to leave there products with gliches but this is miner due to the communty updates",277.5

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazing, enticing open world with vast quanities of things to do. whether it be fighting off legendary dragons or delving deep into the ancient dwemer ruins, it is impossible to get bored. the music is exhilarating and triumphant, the gameplay is stupendous, the languages within the game are linguistically beautiful and you feel like the characters are one with your family. after indulging for hours on end playing this game, youll find your self-impowerment increasing and you will feel like the dovakhiin, or, dragonborn. the soul of a warrior... (i recomend playing at an adept or legendary game difficulty or the game will seem a bit slow) -enthusiastic",13.7
"awesome game! the dlc is way overpriced though. :|",77.3
"i cant really fault it. if you dont like it then you can always mod it to be how you want it to be, the possibilities are endless. want bigger dragons? sure! a free house in a city? no problem!  instead of arrows? ...er ok, if you want...",55.0
"just getting started but love it already! this game is amazing and has incredible re-playability.",0.6
"best game to put on different awesome mods from awesome mod makers i highly recommend - s of skyrim cause its basically skyrim with  10 out of 10 would be  again",228.7
"my reaction when i first played skyrim: wow. not even wow- i was speechless. i had never played a video game so immersive, complex, and interesting before. the motto of the series, you are what you play, definitely holds true with the balanced races and playstyles. want to play as one of the khajiit, but dont want to deal with ridiculously pointless racial boots? dont worry, it doesnt really affect your gameplay in the long run. a legend among rpgs, great for long-time fans of the genre, or someone completely new to rpgs. one of the best games since the n64. 10/10.",67.1
"back when fallout 3 came out i was amazed, when fallout: new vegas was released i was beyond amazed, so when bethesda finally released the next installment in the tes series i had to get some friends to help clean up the chunks of my mind off the floor. the detail and texture work is incredible and the story-telling is immence and full of twists and turns and keeps your hands glued to the keyboard and mouse. good job bethesda, you never seem to let us down. 9/10",58.8
"skyrim was a pleasant surprise for me after the disappointment of oblivion. as a long time tes fan i was vehemently opposed to what i saw as the consolification of the series. in my eyes oblivion was a travesty. after playing skyrim though i have reconsidered. why? because, unlike oblivion, skyrim doesnt try to second guess its philosophy and as a result it does this consolification thing totally right. is it a watered-down streamlined, or as some would say distilled, offspring of daggerfall/morrowind? well yes it is. but at the same time its a highly entertaining game with a rich world and mechanics that work. if you are an old-school crpg-fan keep an open mind and try this. if you are more of a console-style gamer, meh you probably own this already. tl;dr highly recommended.",267.8
"this game is da bomb! buy it now! also, love dem mods! buy it, buy it, buy it! *hypnotoad*",24.6
"great game had all achievements for it on xbox 360 with dawnguard and dragonborn dlc have it on pc for heartfire on anthology pack to try out heartfire still great replay value. open world is good quests are fun but i find the thieves guild less but dark brother hood quest was more fun with mods this game gets even better",125.7

"you can never go wrong with the ability to do anything you want.",28.0
"you must have this game! it is one of the best games ever made and i have a few reasons why. first reason is that the game is huge, after 200 hours there is still a lot of things to do. the side missions are interesting and fun, they are not repetitive and sometimes more interesting than the main story itself. skyrim also have workshop support and the community have some great mods to expand the game whatever way you like! the game also doesnt force you to do the main quest, you can just enjoy the great skyrim nature and the amazing soundtrack and not worry about a thing. the only bad thing is that the game doesnt have any choice system so the world around you wont change much. score: over 9000!/10",451.6

"a must have game for all open world rpg fans, fantasy fans and even for your girlfriends. they can decorate houses, adopt kids n stuff (warning: hearthfire (3,3 - 4,99) and a girlfriend (???) is needed). all the quest lines were different, original and not repetitive. sure you will face some minor glitches and bugs but there are no big deal at all and they shloud not affect your gameplay experience. maiq is tired now. you go bother somebody else ps: the people of skyrim are more open-minded about certain things than people in other places which means same-sex marriage is possible in skyrim!",111.5
"super fun worth every dollar if u got a good laptop/computer to run it on beautiful graphics just for setting it to low loved playing it though my laptop cant run it without lagging sadly, killing a dragon is my fav part in the game and using magic and discovering new stuff items people etc. etc.",13.0
"for those whove played tes iv, skyrim will feel like a natural continuation. somewhat darker, a lot more snow, and a couple of more morally ambiguous quests make it a nice open world rpg. however, the ui is clumsy when played on a computer (being obviously optimized for consoles), and the gameplay/role-playing element is somewhat simplified compared to earlier releases. still, highly recommended.",202.5
"easily one of the top games of 2011, if not the number for sinleplayer anyways. they added some great new features to the franchize. like dual wielding spells and weapons or spell and weapon. i have yet to finish the whole main story even with hundreds of hours played. yet with what i have completed it is a great story probably the best or second story wise. oh and then the mods, thats what really makes this game worth every penny. you can make this game from 2011 look as if it isnt coming out til 2014. i doubt even the new consoles could run my modded copy with its 250+(need speacial mod to have over 250) @ its tremendous 80 80gbs. no matter what people say all the dlc is a must have besides heartfire.(can get pretty much the same with mods) just do yourself a favor and get the legendary edition. anyone who misses this title missed the best game experience money can buy. 11 out of 10 lol. p.s. only thing i wish is they stuck with the old spell crafting system from oblivion or even better yet morrowind.",590.7

"it is a big game, but it is not a deep game. nothing you do in this game matters. you can walk around in the archmages robes and be told to check out the college of winterhold. you can be the leader of the companions supposedly reknowned throughout the land as fearsome warriors and people will ask if you fetch the mead. you can literally slay a dragon known as the world eater and people wont bat an eye. there is no immersion here and the atmosphere is threadbare. the combat is mind-numbingly poor and the ui is poorly designed for pcs. the mage skills are especially poorly balanced, requiring a mod for the destruction school to be effective past level 30. its a decent sandbox but if you want something that will truly let you roleplay, make interesting choices and live with the consequences, this is not that game. if you want a generic fantasy sandbox that you can mod in to something completely different, then you might enjoy it. personally, i cant recommend it.",191.1

"awright... so weve got dragons, shouting old men on mountains, sweet rolls, arrows to knees, knees to faces and faces to axes. theres some verbal assaults on dragons and a little comic mischief along the way. the quests are somewhat in depth at times and you get to pretty much choose your path of what you wanna be.. so long as that path is the dragonborn. theres about 10 million hours of playing and dicking around to be had.. also theres mods now adding more dicking. youve heard of it already, so just buy it. youll like it :3",272.4

"i found skyrim to be immensely enjoyable. right from the word go you are able to make a character from multiple races and alter their appearance as you wish. after the tutorial you are released into the vast, beautiful world of skyrim. as you travel around the land you will experience breathtaking scenery, from snow-covered peaks to glowing caverns, and many unique caves/dungeons/ruins which contain a multitude of enemies from spiders to dragons. you can spend your time mastering the many skills available or completing quests, which there are a ridiculous amount available. in doing so you can gather equipment to allow you to create any kind of character imaginable. if you enjoy an rpg with freedom of creativity, dynamic combat and awesome scenery the skyrim is for you.",845.9

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim; as a new player, i envy your privilege to experience this game as a new. immediately you are placed into the vast ruthless expanse of skyrim, located at the far north of tamriel, skyrim is a country occupied by an old-world society with in-depth political opinions and standings. each npc is convincing in terms of realism and pragmatism and thus the game achieves immersion. the world is unchained and wild, filled with dangers, wonders and a beautiful northern environment. in terms of mechanics skyrim lacks noticeable flaws; the combat system is satisfying and grants the player a sense of overwhelming power once it comes to battle; the soundtrack aiding the effect greatly. composed by jeremy soule and appending to the atmosphere. freedom of the player remains uncompromised, allowing you to approach the game as you please and providing an individualistically adapted experience to each. the narrative is acceptable with a clear equilibrium, disequilibrium and re-equilibrium. a direct link the to the fantasy world is present and it doesnt fail to provide the expected codes and conventions which are demanded by the customer. overall i would recommend this product to any individual.",64.5

"ive been trying to get into this since like right when it came out and i still just cant think of any reasons why id play it over a more well-paced game, or a game with better action, or a game with better storytelling, or even a game with a sharper rpg/tactical edge. it does a lot of things, and its huge, and its certainly not as poorly implemented as some of the more embarrassing assassins creed games, but it feels too weighed down by the sum of its parts, and maybe just a little too tepid to ever fly as freely as it wants to.",14.3

"having played this on the pc and 360 i would highly reccomend the game, it truly stands up to its predecessor with improved combat and visuals. the voice acting like all elder scrolls games is incredible with thousands of dialogue to go through with dozens of quests. the visuals are stunning and there are very rarely graphical issues. the modding community is rife on this game aswell with all kinds of additional content you can download as well as the three main dlcs which add an extra 30-40 hours of play. the only problem i had was that bethesda stopped supporting the game so there is not as much downloadable content as their other games, but the ones they have will keep you entertained. overall i would highly reccomend the game but make sure you have enogh time to play it.",47.9
"this has to be 1 of the greatest games ever to grace my life. i love rpgs, but this game blows any other contenders out of the water. im astonished by the amount of detail that the devs went into, in this game. add that the the playability, story and the size of skyrim, then you have a masterpiece before your eyes! i have put in well over 200 hours of gameplay time into skyrim on the xbox 360 and now i am about to do the same again on the pc version. if you are a fan of rpgs and havent yet played this game, then where have you been!? buy it, play it, love it. -afro gamer",8.4

"along similar lines to its predecessors, the fifth installment of the elder scrolls series will entertain you for a number of hours if you enjoy these sort of first person fantasy games. amazing scenary and graphics with entertaining gameplay, its a great game to immerse yourself in. unfortunately, despite having similar good points to its predecessors, i feel it also shares a number of its predessors bad points, and it probably wont appeal unless youre into this particular genre. for example, one thing ive always felt the elder scrolls series drastically lacked in was a multiplayer mode, but, thatll change with the next installment in the series, elder scrolls online. nonetheless, this is definitely a game id recommend. beautiful scenary. check my screenshots if you want a basic example (or screenshots of other players of the game).",58.3

(same with dragonborn dlc) 5. abilities: in skyrim you can cast magic (destruction spells, conjuration spells - my favorite- and more), have recreational skills (speech, smithing, etc...) or fighting skills (archery, one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons etc...) this game is truly remarkable. you should really consider buying it.",116.1

"so i have heard lots of great things about skyrim. i know many people who have spent hours upon hours playing this game and they were all really happy, myself however i am not happy at all. you start off in a wagon with some guys and thats all cool, you have no idea what you look like or anything so you just cruise along wondering what will happen next. well what happended next upset me beyond belief. the first thing the game allows you to do is make your character and choose what you look like etc. immediately i was dissatisfied and realized what a waste this game was. for one it allows you to be a cat which excited me because i love cats, but i love something else more, and that is broccoli. why in gods name is there no option for you to be a living breathing broccoli in this game?! i cant understand it at all. broccoli is extremely important and many people find it to be wonderful so how could you allow people to be cats but not broccoli! its truly a waste and until you guys make broccoli a standard character of this game i doubt i will be playing again. thanks for nothing.",0.9

"as long as bethesda is gone keep their horrible pc interfaces it will never be a good game. oblivion, fallout 3, this one... its like they have all that awfull interface, is it so difficult to get a good interface on pc and not that stupid console port? how many sales do they need to have finally a playable interface like most real rpgs on pc. give us a kind of mmorpg interface. guild wars 2 for example... rpgs are played with mouses not pads! lucky for me i have a g11 and g602 to be able to macro a lot of buttons. the combat is slightly better then oblivion with finishing moves added. i really enjoy the dungeons but get annoyed by the towns. some little adds are nice like finding treasure maps and more. auto level scaling is still the major problem for me but is less obvious then in oblivion. anyway the game needs to be modded, without mods i would never recommend this game, but lucky for us there are so many good people around that do the work for bethesda to make the game a bit more enjoyable, but even now i find it still a bit early, this game will probably perfect in about 2 years, i hated oblivion at start and loved it 3-4 years later with 50 mods installed. dlcs are a bit better then oblivion where we had stupid things like mage tower and other crap. 5/10 standard 8/10 with many mods and many hours to install them...",12.7

(not online, thats daylight robbery)",1223.8

"its an amazing rpg with and very open world and has more things to do in it than i can count. a few minor glitches set it back but by very little. you can also mod the game to your hearts content. so buy this game. 9001/10",264.8

"this game is the epicest in my gaming history. well the giant spiders are scary as the  for me because i have arachnophobia but i can remove them with a mod. so if you like the weapons of the medieval ages and some spells then buy it, you wont be disappointed! :d",50.1
"best game on pc that i own i have atleast 300 hrs on this but thats over everything i had it on",98.9
"this game might now have the rp elements that oblivion had or the original feel, but the game is still moderately fun and great for a sequel. just add a few mods to it, and youd feel right at home with this game.",170.0
"this game rocks, large open world, no need to follow the main story, great combat, incredible detail, doesnt need a top of the line computer to run (actually runs better than my minecraft does 9_6), slay dragons, an anazing world to play in, npcs that are more than just props, giant spiders, vampires and werewolves. whats not to love about this game?",898.9
"most beautiful consumer of free time in recent memory!!",33.9
"the main story isnt that long and could be finished in less than 10 hours. however, it is the side quests which gives the game its length and makes it interesting. the good thing about the pc version is that if you screw up the skill tree or could not finish a quest because it is bugged then you can fix it by typing certain commands. crafting is so much fun and isnt that simple as several things could effect the outcome. the only downside to this game, well for me, is how the choices you make effect the outcome. if you are obsessed with knowing every possible outcome or finishing every quest then it becomes really annoying. i spent a lot of time reading guides to know is the outcome for each desicion, i really hated that. sometimes dungeons do get repetitive and annoying. id give it an 8/10.",316.5
"i feel like everything that could have been said about this game has been said already but here goes.. if skyrim did not win you over with its amazing graphics then you can always look to the amazing action gameplay of skyrim. dont like action? skyrim includes one of the most amazing stealth mechanics of any game that can be used from early on to the end of the game. dont like stealth either? theres always frickin magic! dont like magic? ....the hell are you doing playing video games... but highly understated is the storyline of skyrim, playing as the last dragonborn to defeat alduin and save tamriel. the main storyline gives 70+ hours of gameplay and hundreds more with the side quests not to even mention the dlc and the infinite amount of mods from the workshop. overall one of the best games of all time and worthy of its amazing legacy! -10/10 ~delta",346.3
"a fantastic sequel to the series. improved the keyboard mapping from oblivion and quests have more depth.",32.4
"epic game! i had already played and completed this game on the xbox a while ago but picked up the legendary edition on offer and have thoroughly enjoyed another playthrough, as well as the dlc that i hadnt played previously. quite possibly the best rpg out there to date, it looks great, especially with the hd texture pack and a few additional workshop mods and has, for me personally, the best levelling up system around, and thats without mentioning the sheer size of the vast, vibrant open world. its not without its flaws, there were a number of missions that had glitched and i either couldnt complete or had to mess around to work around bugs, and even though the voice acting was a huge improvement on oblivion there still only seemed to be half a dozen or so different voices in the game, which when you put 100+ hours into a game can grate a little. however these are minor issues compared to the enjoyment the game as a whole has given me.",100.6
"i wanted to like skyrim. for the first 20 hours, i actually kind of did. but the more i played, the more i realized how the characters, the story and the world are extremely uninspired and the quests and the combat are boring. it wouldnt matter to the npcs if i murdered the entire city guard or if i were the thane of every city in skyrim, they would still say the same bland things, performed by an extremely limited supply of voice actors. 50 hours in to the game, whatever quest i choose to do, it feels like im doing a chore. kill x, retrieve y, talk to z. it changes nothing, i just gain bigger numbers and make markers on my map disappear. thats it. the environments are beautiful (though they dont offer a great deal of variety) and the world is vast, but as mentioned, extremely static. no amount of modding can fix that, even though there obviously have been attempts at it. i just cant enjoy this game anymore, not even with all the mods i have installed.",49.9

"i have lost alot of my life on this game and that was just playing on xbox and i am loseing even more of my life playing it on the computer it is ten times better and i would recomend the game a thousand times and and i would recomend it even more than that if you are getting it for the using mods it is a million times more if you are using it with mods buy this game you will lose your life this game gets five stars",126.6

"i have only just started playing skyrim on pc but i have easily put in over 1000+hrs of vanilla skyrim on xbox and then i have also played the dawnguard,hearthfire and dragonborn dlcs. this is easliy my all time favorite videogame ever. the fights are always fun but the thing i love most about this game is adventuring. during everysingle playthrough i have gone through i have always found something new in this game. it might be a new item or a new dungeon or a simple little easteregg. now that i play on pc i can add mods to add a survival factor which means those one useless pieces of food and alchohol have become an essential aspect to the game. but above all else my most faaaaaaaavorite thing about this game is smashing those snotty thalmors faces in. 11/10 would bash some skulls any day.",49.5

"a good first/third person game with plenty of mods to choose from a superb story line and you neve get board",818.3
"one of the worst wrpgs ive played. from the getgo, theres no mouse support, bethesda dont care about pc gamers whatsoever. graphics are one of the worst ive seen; since a very very long time. and now, for the most important category: the gameplay. the gameplay is just simply horrendous; the combat mechanics are awful, almost to the degree of unplayability. theres no feedback when slashing and attacking enemies, slashing enemies is as physical as slashing thin air, which makes it very hard to know if youre actually doing any damage at all. the magic system is probably the worse any game could have, its like a complete after thought. running and other body movements are so stiff, its like something from 2002 or earlier... i honestly find it hard to recommend this game; even at $7.50.. therere much much better rpgs out there for the money; darksouls, witcher 2, darksiders 2, dragon age origins,two worlds 2 and kingdoms of amalur reckoning; are just some to mention!",11.0
"you will undoubtly and whole heartedly enjoy this amazing game. the vanilla game is a superb step up from oblivion and dont even get me started how amazing your game can be with mods. if your one of the few people who doesnt actually have this game... what the hell are you doing with your steam funds?",16.0
"pure addiction! too much things to do in this game!",516.6
"came out almost three years ago, still a game i play all the time and would consider one of my favorites of all time. easily the best rpg game ive ever played, the level of customization that you can build into your character is amazing and the huge open world gives hundreds of hours of enjoyment. ive been a fan of the oblivion, and this game is by far my favorite to play, especially now that im playing on the pc instead of on the consoles. highly recommended for any players that want an amazing game in which to lose themselves for a few months or years.",137.8

"this game is a masterpiece. it is one of the most addicting games i have every played. a full completion takes over a hundred hours, and after it, you can just start again as a new race and the game is completely different. there is so much freedom in this game, you can stop a quest at any time and do another one. this is one of the best games i have ever played, yes, you are overpowered in combat when youre a certain level and there is not much challenge, but that doesnt change that this game is a masterpiece. 10/10",206.7

"fun game, good rpg experience and addictive as hell!",256.4
"10 reasons why i love skyrim: 1. in combat you can have a lunch break: eat a truck load of bread, cheese rolls, apples. dont worry, your enemy will wait. 2.the shout fus ro dah has two uses: in combat and removing your braindead ai partner out of the way. 3.can achieve suborbital flight thousands of years ahead of spaceflight (aka get hit by a giant). 4.there are more dragons then soldiers in cities. 5.carry trillion arrows and gold - no wight. carry about 10 scales: overweight bi*ch. 6.bandits have better equipment then guards. 7.can kill hundreds, cant kill a captain of a camp. 8.dont have sleep for years, rest 8 hours - well rested bonus. 9.all people think you are a psychologist: they tell all of their problems. 10.save a town from a dragon attack, the next day none of the residents give a damn.",75.3

"skyrim is awesome. whilst working on a quest you find a note in the world that makes you pursue another quest. this goes on until you no longer remember what your original goal was, that is the beauty of skyrim and elder scrolls. exploration, rewarding gameplay, choices (you are not given as much freedom in choices as you were in morrowind, though) and funny  bugs that have always defined elder scrolls to me.",204.0
"just perfect. so open and so many choices i cant seem to stop restarting the game with new characters.",413.3
"a moderately-large world, with multiple quest, fine rpg aspects and dragons. lets not forget the fact that it can be modded.",105.2
"what can i say. its really one of the best games ever created. graphics are unreal and outdo themselves again with the download content hd textures pack. gameplay is close enough to all elder scrolls games as expected but has enough difference to previous elder scrolls titles. huge world, loads of free mods available, huge amount of gameplay & quests. if you dont already have skyrim then buy it now dammit. i rate this game: gameplay - 10 graphics - 10 overall - 10 ----------------------------------------------------- rating key (overall score) = 1-3 bad bad game 4-6 good or at least some kind of fun 7-10 great game highly recommended",128.3
"the story is bland, the voice over is awful, and its full of bugs. but god damn if its not a ton of fun. with an active modding community constantly updating the graphics and adding new missions and customizations, you could easily sink 500+ hours into this game. as far as open-world action/rpgs go, it doesnt get much better than skyrim.",218.7
"some of my favorite things about this game was that even when you were to finish the main story line there are side quests so you dont get bored. then another thing was the hug amount of mods that you can use because i have not seen a lot of other games with a huge amounts of mods. i would think only about 15 other games have more or close to the amount this game hold. but some of the things i dont like is how its not online and its only single player. i usally play online games but i saw a mod recently today for online where you can trade chat and other things its seems interseting but i have to go find it agian. if i were to rate this game i would say 8.5 because mods and for the amount of freedom that is in this game.",21.1

"its skyrim. youve heard about it and youve never tried it? for the amount of gameplay, stories, and tinkering you get through the steam workshop, its a hard game to dislike. adios, free time...",135.5
"its ok...not as good as i thought it was going to be...although it is almost 3 yrs old now. not bad for $20 bucks, but this game is the kind to take all your time, so i wouldnt buy it again unless i didnt have any other games to play.",6.0
"the best non-online game ive ever played, hands down!",112.5
"great game, pales in comparison to oblivion though.",789.1
"amazing game, forced myself to 100% skyrim & all dlcs. definitely worth buying!",175.2
"well where do i start...... this game was my first on steam, i have not clocked the hours other have but in the time i have played on here, i have modded the hell out of it and still cant find a mod i dont like. i have recently bought a number of games and still i find myself looking on the steam workshop for skyrim and looking at new mods to try. i have never completed the main quests and i have not touched the dlcs in full but what i have seen and found will remain with me forever. this game ruin ur life and intrests but i promise you know, its all worth it.",89.7
"just look at how many hours most players who play this game have logged playing this game. that should tell you how immersive skyrim can and will be. it has to be considered one of the best games ever made, let alone in its genre, and certainly one of the best ive ever played and enjoyed. nothing shy of epic.",369.0
"skyrim is a very in-depth rpg game that you can spend hundreds of hours on and still have content left to complete. if youre looking to put a lot of time, and effort if you want, into a game then i would definitely suggest skyrim. there are so many other things you can do which arent part of the main quest line. even when you have finished the first quest line you are introduced to, you are no-where near finishing the game. thats one of the main things i love about it. skyrim will always offer you something new to do; and when you get to the point of wanting more, thats when you can choose to mod your game. the modding community for skyrim is very large. if you dont like something about the game, chances are, theres a mod to change it. if you feel like things are missing from the game, then theres probably a mod to add it too. you can pick and choose from mods to make the game how you want it to be. the steam workshop makes it easy to mod your game with minimal effort involved. if you want a single player game that you can lose yourself in, pick this one. in my opinion, you could never play this game and regret it. pretty much the best rpg game out there",346.6
"great game, but i still think oblivion is much better, because oblivion had much, much, much better lore. skyrim had way better graphics and combat system. over all i feel that oblivion is still the best, also bigger map and better side and main quests.",126.7
"skyrim is an amazing new world where almost anything is possible. especially with the mod system built into steam, the sky is the limit. great game. fully rated",28.9

"beautiful game with hundreds of hours of replayability. one of the best products from bethesda studios. i highly recommend!",229.9
"this is a really good game whit dragons and really fun quests.",49.3
"game had a lot of hype, it delivered but not as much as i wished. after about 50+ hours of play i begin to see how boring the game actually is. the game was marketed towards casual players, so they scrapped assigning ponts to certain skills because that would be too confusing for them. game has no depth, people dont really know that you are the guild master of every guild and the dragonborn. sword fighting is boring, archery is pretty nice though, and magic. fighting dragons was really cool and tense when you first encountered them, then eventually just got boring and tedious. some of the things i did like about the game are:- nice environment good looking dungeons and varied(not every dungeon is a cave like oblivion) good attention to detail on the weapons and armour brilliant ambient music lockpicking from fo3(i found oblivions lockpicking frustrating) with all that said i still wont stop playing until ive done everything even if it is boring. hope the next one is better.",72.9

"one of the best games i have ever played! i first played skyrim on xbox and i have around 120+ hours on that and i just recently got it for p.c and it is like playing a whole new game. one of the greatest features about playing skyrim on p.c is all the mods! its a refrshing experience and adds a lot more to the game. but this game isnt all about mods, this game has hundreds of hours of gameplay.",66.9
"pros: --------------------------------------- -beautiful enviroments and art style -decent character customization -tons of content -interesting and fun quests -plenty of weapons, armor and loot -storyline is decent and fun to play through -battling is slightly clunky, but all the same incrediblely fun. -lore is amazingly well written -no limitations (i.e. you dont need to choose a class) -open world -a wide arsenal of mods to choose from ---------------------------------------- neutral: ---------------------------------------- -characters voices actors are exceptional, yet they are overused ---------------------------------------- cons: ---------------------------------------- -there are occassional glitches that may annoy some people. (i have only come across one game breaking glitch on x360) ---------------------------------------- my score: 96.5/100",287.8
"great game, although i never quite got around to the main quest despite being nearly 100 hours in. no where near done though.",101.4
"yelled at a bear, he flew up the side of a mountain, rolled back down, tried to get up but just looked like he was breakdancing, then fell down another part of the mountain. recommended.",329.1
"whenever i get to a great part in the game i delete my save by mistake hoping that quicksaves are still there but they delete themselves very often. worth buying it thought. 19/10 best exploring game in the world,hopefully till the next one.",164.0

"nice rpg game. huge open world with lot of deep storied fantastic locations.",51.6
"any game that i can interupt a man eating his potato dinner via blasting him off a cliff by yelling at him is worth owning in my opinion.",774.9
"a great improvement over previous elder scrolls games. the faces werent creepy ( just a bit squareish ;p but thanks to the modding community that we can rule it out now ), and the dungeons felt suitably different. the enormous world has a lot of fun things no matter where you start looking, and the level system makes it possible to build a large variety of characters without the risk of making an inept character that existed in previous games. there are a large number of points in the game where the player is forced into a single course of action, or an event is triggered regardless of how you attempt to avoid it. this was annoying, but did not prevent me from enjoying the game :)",369.3
"skyrim + mods = best rpg experince ive witnessed so far!",691.6
"great fun game if youre looking to kill some time... or a lot of time",151.9
"amazing game, absolute must have game! it has an incredibly immersive map, it does not lacks any detail, you can spend hours and hours exploring beautifully constructed landscape. the graphics are stunning and play smooth, the main story line is great, but it is the sheer amount of side quests that make this game excel from the rest. the side quests are well thought out, include detailed and numerous npcs will have some form of small task for you to complete. the level-up system is a joy to use, with a clear description of each perk and what it gives you, the number of things you can do in the game is overwhelming, from simply chopping wood to crafting your very own set of dragon armor, and the range of skills is incredible and those are just a few ive mentioned. it easily makes its way into my top five.",10.4
"great game, endless fun with mods, what more could you want?",16.3
"this si one of my favorite games of all time!! if you like the lord of the rings, fantasy, and role playing games you will love this flawless game. you can custumize the game through the workshop, the nexus, and just doing what you want with the race and weapon system. you could either be stealth, mage, or warrior. i rate this game at 9/10",90.6
"amazing once you get a few mods running, if your computer can handle it all...",365.6
"youve most likely heard the hype surrounding this game, and for the most part its all true. easy to get addicted to, but in the end its like peanut butter; yeah its good, but after a while you get sick of it.",417.7
"this game is absolutely fantastic. it gets a bit boring after a while just playing vanilla, but after installing the millions of mods and many dlcs the game experience is enhanced dramatically.",483.2
"never played an elder scrolls game before this but was tempted by the hype of eso so bought their anthology and its more than lived up to its reputation - i cant say enough great things about this game. anyway im hooked so back to questing, exploring and decision making",129.3
"if you loved the elder scrolls: oblivion, you are sure to love this game even more, there are a lot more features in this game, and the story line is well laid out. this game you will spend hours on end playing this. this is definitely another no. 1 hit from bethesda studios.",271.5
"i enjoy the open world feeling. you can pretty much play the game the way you want, and your characers skills develop around how you play.",110.2

"awesome game! a true must for rpg fans and people who like playing in a huge open world for hours on end. beautiful landscapes and views, great immersive story-line, lots of missions and enemies to fight.",852.5
"i cant recommand this enough, this game is perfect at everything, the story,controls and gameplay. a must buy 1010",14.1
"skyrim: the best fantasy rp (in my opinion). if you like fantasy, rp, individuality, and choices, this is the game for you. thanks to steam, nexus and a special thanks to all the developers, we players can get even more out of the experiance of playing skyrim. as a female gamer i find this helps meet might individual needs and style as a rp. im still new to steam. but so far it has been a blast. so far i have nothing negative to say. at this point i am a 100% costumer.",574.1
"a harrowing simulation of a world where animals fall from the sky and everyone has been crippled by arrows in knees. emergent horror gameplay as entire towns follow you into your house and have to be told to leave by your huscarl. marry a lizard but not a cat. become a mage. kill butterflies.",282.3
"the latest installation in the elder scrolls has had me captivated for so many hours i dont even want to actually know, but buying it from the day of release on 11.11.11, to this day it still lies high on my list of games to play when im bored. escapism at its greatest, and when youre given so much freedom its so easy to get lost in, skyrim is no.1 for rpg games ive come across in terms of replayability, design and gameplay. people may mock it for its petty flaws here and there, but its list of flaws compared to its list of triumphs is dwarfed massively. with lore so deep, i dread to think i may know more about elder scrolls history than real life history, but this is just yet another aspect of not only the game, but the series which makes the world feel so real and alive. with un-beaten character customisation and development, this allows players to create any character they can possibly imagine and play to as style which they choose. to any rpg fans whom havent yet discovered the elder scrolls series or for those looking to get into the genre, i cannot recommend this game enough, if you fall in love with the series like all elder scrolls fans do, youll get your moneys worth without a doubt.",13.0

"the dream of every rpg fan. hundreds of hours to keep you busy and exploring and leveling up. customizable characters that you choose how to develop. great graphics, sounds, environment, enemies, effect... perfect. only drawback is how steam sales the game. i own the game from before and in each sale the dlcs cost more than the package of dlcs along with the game. i should not have purchased the game so as to get a better deal... thats new!",124.1
"skyrim isnt a new game, yet i havent been able to put it down since i go it in 2011. immensely immersive, and an amazing contribution to an already great series!",274.4

"i had a girfriend before i got skyrim. i left her for a higher power. 10/10 would leave that bi**h again",13.2
"where to start.this game is beautiful but that isnt it.this game keeps the lore throughout the game.unless you are like me and mod this game to hell.it has a good leveling system and weapons and unlike most games the elder scrolls have a weight limit to it",119.5
"totally worth every penny with the outstanding gameplay, graphics, soundtrack, and the spectacular vast landscape to explore when you want to, where you want to. 10/10 would enjoy",256.4
"this game is very very good i always loved the tes series but this is amazing. and it has a wide modding community ;d",55.5
"one of the best games i have ever played. the best part of it is that you can be totally involved in the world around you.",889.9
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a game which is in many ways limitless because its a huge sandbox just waiting to be explored its gonna last you for weeks and with the steamworkshop mod support its gonna extend the gameplay and overall experience of the game. i highly recommend you buy it on sales because its too pricy i got it for 40$ and i wasnt complaining but you can get better offers!",187.0

"you probably already know that the game is awesome.",268.2
"got 100s of hours of fun out of this the first time i played on ps3, now im back for 100s more on the pc. an amazing game that demands to be played. bethesda blows the competition along with all their own prior games out of the water with each new release & skyrim is their latest and greatest. engaging gameplay, a fully realized world, and a real drive to become stronger.",8.7
"buy 1 game + 3 dlcs, get mods, and then you have infinite games.",213.2

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim, especially the legendary edition, offers an incredibly immersive rpg experience. while it is known to be a little bit glitchy at times, it is easily the best pc game that i have played in the rpg genre. in addition to multiple storylines, gorgeous graphics, and badass bosses (any veteran players remember that first fight with alduin before we hit the restart and went godmode all the way through the game? come on you know what i mean ;-p ), skyrim also has an active and talented modding community (since i use mage as the base of my class i highly recommend the midas magic evolved mod.) i will readily admit to being as addicted to this game as an addict is to...........you get the idea. on a scale of 1 through 5, i give skyrim a strong rating of 4.9 . if a patch is made available that fixes the glitches then that rating would go up to 5. m/==(-_-)==m/",186.8
"all these anime sex mods truly bring skyrimjob to life",7.5
"oh, skyrim. what a great experience. you start playing this game and you will never complete it. you will continue returining to skyrim many times. you will spend countless hours exploring, hunting, killing bandits, and many other cool things. add mods to the mix and you can customize and enhace the core game towards the perfect rpg. if youre a true gamer, you should never live without missing this one.",100.3
"brilliant game and very pretty :3 especially with mods!!!!",9.2
"10/10 would mod again one of the best experiences i have had during my many gaming experiences,  the game was so amazing on console i was forced to buy it again on pc, and thats saying somthing due to the fact that half the fun in this game is to see how much you can mod the  out of it until it crashes your poor little pc. do yourself a favor if you have not tried this game out go an buy it and hopefully have as much fun with it as i have.",256.5
"i was going to review this game... but then i took a arrow to the knee",18.3

"one of the best games i have ever played. so diverse and so many quests, you start to think your actually in the game. amazing, would recommend to anyone at all.",7.2
"i recommend the game but i dont recommend steam, as i tried to get the lock pick pro mod and then i had to subscribe to the creator then had to make a thing to have as to get the mod, and i still cant seem to get it,,wtf, i dont need the trauma of trying to do what steam wants me to do for something that should be simple !",271.6
"this game is literally a high end software game. it was fun when the loading screen didnt take ten minutes for small places! get some really good software if you plan to get the dlcs or your looking at long loading screens. but, this is a really good game to not lie. its got a short main questline. but it does make up for it by having so many quests. the reason i bought this was for nolgastia. i miss playing morrowind.",47.2
"at this point, if you do not have skyrim, i dont think there is any help for you. its a game that needs to be owned by every steam user, xbox/play station player, and be in the dreams of every small child yet to have a gaming system. thats just the way it is, so buy this game - and dont cheap out - buy the legendary edition or you aint nothing.",94.8
"off-line i have played over 600 hours and just love skyrim. the modding comunity is wonderful. the one thing i really wish for is a way to play this over lan 2-4 people runing around in skyrim would be incredible. 2-4 over steam would be my second choice. i have played eso but returned to skyrim.",20.7

"skyrim is a cold place with craggy mountains and harsh weather. i feel at home. nice world for exploring. legendary edition is a good buy when on sale. i never buy $50 or $60 games. the questline for a couple of factions, in my opinion, is too short.",375.8
"im not sure what to tell you that you dont already know, this game is amazing. it has replayability beyond the vanilla quests due to the massive community and their dedication to mods. if you are somebody who likes rpgs, first or third person games, nearly limitless customization, and the ability to add mods. this is a game for you. also, it has dragons, what else could you ask for.",184.0

"the major plus that sets elder scrolls skyrim on pc apart from consoles is the wor- the nexus. being able to mod your followers into hot babes that are empowered to be treated as your equal. your male partner doesnt like being male? great! just give her a sex change and now she is a bangin babe that was stronger than before with even less armor covering her wicked rims of the sky.",142.6

"this game is an epic adventurer game and it is perfect for people who love adventure! this game is a 10/10 game and is totally awesome!!!",18.4
"enjoyable, though sometimes a bit slow. can be a bit overwhelming at times but if you stay focused and really enjoy open world options this game rocks!",29.2
"its addictive, runs well for a game with such good graphics, has an awesome modding community even though it came out 3 years ago, great replay value, never ending entertainment, and is pretty much the best rpg on the market. 9/10 because f*** the falmer.",306.5

"it is the greatest adventure i have ever undertake, from the fog covered swamps of the hjalmarch too the throat of the world a new story or encounter rests around the next bend. this is a master piece of story, art and gameplay all melded into the pinnacle of rpgs.",126.1
"you skyrim you downsyndrome peice of ing  on a popo which chokes of wrinkly donkey  becaues thats all it will ever manage to get!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",77.1
"having only heard peoples geeky, and nerdy comments about this game, i was hesitant in purchasing it... until it arrived in the winter sales for only a few pounds - i bought it. what can be expected only from bethesda was over 90 hours (still not total) of immersive gameplay in this fascinating title. similar to the fallout games, skyrim is a brilliant rpg game where nearly every action has a consequence on how the story pans out. slay dragons, help out in and around villages, craft weapons and armour from various materials, start faction wars? whats not to like? 10/10. would purchase again.",91.3
"the elder scrolls series have always been one of my favorite game series. a huge world, fully voiced npcs, tons of quests, engaging combat and infinite reasons to replay it. add that with the open modding community and you have a seemingly immortal game. they improved the combat alot in the game, added new possible play styles and improved the overall a.i. its got a few nostalgia bits in it aswell as tons of new content. its really a one of a kind experience. your adventure awaits!",276.6
"one of the most intense, addicting, and expansive games ive ever played. if youre looking for something to spend 100 hours on, skyrim is your game. this is without a doubt the most you can get in a game for $60. i highly reccomend it to fantasy-rpg and open world fans.",213.0
"bit shorter than previous elder scrolls and in my opinion not as good a game as morrowind and oblivion, but much more advanced gameplay and graphics and still amongst the best rpgs made.",32.1
"by far one of my favorite games. i dont even know how many times i have played through it now.",462.6
"if you are into rpg/frp games and you want to be inside the game as yourself instead of seeing the character from up top, and of course you dont like team play, this is the one for you. in fact play the entire series of elders scrolls from the beginning, my recommendation would be to play at least morrowind and oblivion first then move on to this one, youll get the stories and place names better plus the story lines are loosely connected.",22.8
"you need to read the reviews? as in: you havent bought skyrim already? wow.",57.8
"in the top ten games ever for me. (ive actually played like 400 hours, this is just a different account) its beautiful, fun, and even more fun to mod!",69.5

"one of the must own  games for any pc gamer :) just by itself it is worth getting, as it is such a rich and fun story (and side quests) that you feel compleed to finish it, then you got all the side quests and everything, making it worth your money. and then you get all the mods for it too! worth buying",80.6
"its ok i guess. nothing to do once you finish the main quests though. got to marry a dark elf, adopt kids and own/build several houses while being a millionaire so its not all bad.",509.0
"it is simply the best. 10/10 best action medieval/fantasy roleplaying game out there.",214.0

"lets see, skyrim; what can i say for a review about that game called skyrim... well, now looking on it, i feel my situation explains it pretty well: as i write this, the time is 2:30 am 2 days after i got it; and i already have 12 hours on this. and as i explore the world and view its life in every corner, i know i have only scratched the surface on the game. what can i say; i love the arnold schwarzenaeger voice for the guards.",208.6
"this is worth playing for days of gameplay and with the dlc it is amazing! it is worth $20 for a game like skyrim. this game has a great soundtrack and mods! i recommend the pony dragon mod from nexus mods! you can play it over and over again!",79.4
"one of the best rpgs i ever played. the map is huge with thousands of quests and side quests. theres a lot of items you can get, the main story is long and epic. i strongly recommend this game to someone who wants to use a lot of time on a brilliant game.",144.9
"incredible gameplay with lots of different stuff to do and a pretty immersive experience. not to mention the no restriction character creation and the huge world! it does still have bugs, glitches and exploits but not gamebreaking. verdict : a must have for fantasy rpg lovers! 8.50/10",184.9
"from morrowwind,straight through to oblivion, and the current rpg masterpiece we have skyrim.i thought that i had seen everything there was to see in the rpg based genre, but skyrim came to dominate my thought has to what a rpg should be, in everyway possible.visually, skyrim has reached the climax in sheer beauty,blended with the ever so addictive storytelling.bethesda have come a long way with the elder scrolls saga.i would highly recommend this to any adventure loving gamer.",45.7
"210+ hours played, and thats an understatement of how great this game is. the biggest point of adoration for me is the lore. the whole universe that bethesda has created in the elder scrolls is just so damn fascinating, it always draws me in. buy it now if you havent already.",356.1
"fun rpg. have spent a lot of time playing. even if the story isnt the most engaging ive ever played, the world itself is extremely broad. as its a bethesda game, there are always a few bugs lurking about, but the various mods around the area should be able to fix that easily. would definately reccomend.",189.1
"skyrim... i dont really think theres much that i can say about this game that hasnt already been said! ive played hundreds of hours on this game (i initially played on console) and ive loved every minute! skyrim is one of those games that just never gets old, you can always come back to it and therell be new stuff to find. and thats just vanilla without mods; the modding community for this game is fantastic, and if you cant find what you want on the steam workshop there are thousands of mods on the skyrim nexus. from things as simple as retextures to make your game beautiful, all the way up to entirely new worlds, there are mods out there that will completely change your experience. and thats what i lovwe about this game, it never plays the same twice! i highly recommend this game to anyone, even if youre not a big rpg fan, this game is still a masterpiece! at such a low price now, this game is an absolute steal!",126.8
"while not as truly free as morrowind and lacking the interesting quests from oblivion, skyrim isnt as good(or as bad) as a lot of people seem to think, in my humble opinion. enjoyable, but quite a few features were removed and streamlined from previous entries and like oblivion, i think bethsesda was banking on the modding community fixing several bugs and making overall improvements. an improvement from oblivion, minus the quests, and downgrade from morrowind(exlcuding graphics and a few other improvements that have come from recent technology), still a solid elder scrolls title.",287.2
"this is the coolest game for rpg fans i must say. its really hard to find a mistake. the graphics is beautiful the main story is very smart and original. and when i watch the progress. daggerfall, arena, morrowind, oblivion and skyrim! i just cant wait for the next game. because its better and better every time and if you like rpg.... ....i cant find any better game for you than skyrim. but when i think about it now... ... there is just one little thing that i enjoyed in oblivion more than in skyrim. because the testing hall in skyrim is really boring. and thats all. i cant see anything worse than that. and if you dont like cheats... ... well then its a perfect game for you. i love it. buy it. :-d",368.1
"i really love this game pros +the world and story are rich +many many hours of gameplay time +immersive +nice exploration with hundreds of locations to discover +great skill tree +decent character customization (but kinda lacking in hair) +difficult choices and decisions cons -kinda linear on armor progression -lack voice acting variety -a bit repetitive combat on melee fighter -bugs and sometimes sudden crash the best thing is most of the cons can be fixed by mods,so you can really make this game almost perfect 8.5/10 but with mods i give it a 9.5/10",75.6
"for those of you who think this game is bad... its probably because you didnt take them time to stop and look... most of you prob rushed through dungeons and just wanted to slay monsters, without checking chests,secrets,looting enemys, or even the amazing side quests such as the college of winterhold that questline is like a twinkie with ice-cream its really good.. ( try a twinkie with ice-cream, youll be happily suprised )",40.3

"the base version of this game was amazing. it had the looks, a great story, tons of items, lots to do but then you start adding mods and it becomes legendary. if you dont own this game idk why, either you are a pleb or you hate rts games. buy it now!!!",177.7

"one of the best games ever made, skyrim is certainly within my top five of favourite games. the amount of content is staggering and not seen in many other games today, you can easily reach well over 300+ hours if you truly immerse yourself. skyrim is gorgeous and the art direction is fantastic, every play session for me yields a few screen shots and the attention to detail is fantastic. the story is good and can truly feel epic if you take the time to immerse yourself in the game world. completing the side quest and various faction quests is highly recommended, these quests really add to the overall experience. if you can get past the bugs and put the effort to immerse yourself into skyrim, the game satisfy you for hundred of hours.",439.0

"the 5th installment in the elder scrolls series takes place in skyrim, the northern most territory of tamriel and home of the nords. it is a mountainous and cold region filled with large valleys and snowy forests and plains. skyrim now employs a perk system that you invest a single point per level up. no longer are abilities dictated by 7 primary statistics like previous elder scrolls titles, so leveling is somewhat streamlined allowing you to focus on adventuring and exploring and less about raising specifc skills for optimal multipliers when you level up. this further emphasizes the point of freedom and playing however you want instead of being locked into specific or preset skills which forces you to play a certain way just to level up. continuing the tradition of being able to go wherever you want and how you want to play, skyrim has various caverns and ruins for the player to explore. all in all its a excellent title in the elder scrolls series. i recommend it.",560.4
"this is seriously a must have game. you might think right off the bat that skyrim is a game about killing dragons and running around doing quests and what not. but trust me this game is not only unique but it has a fantastic story line, characters you will learn to love, and the complete freedom to make your character and the story what you want. i know this because have played hundreds of hours of this game on the ps3.

"very addictive and tons of quests and things to do. only down side is that if a quest giver dies yo can never start the quest of turn it in. unless your on the pc so you can spawn another person using the console. but besides form that and not being able to have multiple character files i say a 4.5/5",195.7

"skyrim is a beautiful, gigantic world full of diverse towns, dwemer ruin labyrinths, dragon lairs, and ancient tombs. almost every location feels unique and hand-made, filled with tiny details and nuances. however, everything else is a letdown. stripped of stats, the only enchantments you can put on equipment (or stats on found equip) are elemental damage/resistance, damage/skill boosts, or stat drains/boosts. magic and skills are very shallow and have zero scaling, resulting in mages being underpowered late game while meleers kill everything in 2 hits on the hardest difficulty. the games best aspect, exploration, soon becomes unrewarding when you can craft & enchant better equip than can be found anywhere. the main questline, which will take you about 40 hours, is your typical you are the chosen one story (but still has some memorable moments given how much traveling you do). sadly, skyrims world is trapped in a mediocre, dumbed down, dx9 console port.",89.1

"pretty much everything to be said about this game has already been said. from the perspective of a person who has logged well over 100 hours into the game on xbox 360, this was a must have when i got my pc. the mods breath a whole new level of fun into this game that i did not even know was possible. play with the mods in the workshop and tailor the game to your liking. the possibilities are endless.",9.1
"i get bored easily in games, and usually their genre is rpg, or tps. but dude, this game! let me tell you this, nothing in this game is boring. just when i start to get bored a dragon appears from nowhere and cheers me up. not to mention random quest givers popup everytime. after 60 hours of gameplay i still have tons of quest in my list and i dont know which one i should choose next :) im not an old school elder scrolls fan, the first game of bethesda i played was fallout 3. i loved the game but couldnt play it, because it made me depressed. instead i watched my friend playing and i had so much fun. but in skyrim i dont have to worry about that. because the atmosphere is too damn cool. just look at that huge mountain or wow that city dude if you still wondering, stop and buy this game. get your coffee at 8 pm, and start playing. :)",59.1

"skyrim. the most anticipated game of 2011. steam has made this a game of creativity with the steam workshop, letting players use the many homes, weapons, and even quests people have created. i, personally, have not obtained the dlcs, as i bought this game many years ago. however, to those looking to buy this game: dont cheap out with the original version. if you want all the possible fun from this game, buy the legendary edition. some mods even comply with the dlcs, like specialty homes (hf dlc) and crossbows (dg dlc). overall, one of the greatest rpgs of all time. for being close to 3 years old at this rate, it still holds great value to those who enjoy the custom rpg.",267.5
"for some odd reason i cant explain, the game just randomly kicks me. it is impossible to play because it kicks me ever 1 min or so. this means that i haft to reload back to the last save and restart. the saves dont even matter though because i can barely get anywhere before i do get kicked. watch out!!",30.8

"ive spent hours and hours on this game, and regret nothing. that should tell you how good it is! the game itself is a great idea, filled with great story, a massive world, and exploration that is fun. this game isnt achore to advance in. however, it seems a bit rushed. the civil war questline, the secondary plot line, is only a few hours long, and seems to be a huge build up that ends in one battle. these battles can be so much greater! if this game did not have a steam workshop and such a great community, id almost say dont buy it. the mods fix everything the developers didnt have time to do. with the community mods, this game is everything you wanted it to be, and the unmodded game is worth a few hours of fun itself. i would highly suggest a play through with no mods, then start a new game and see the wonders this amazing community has to offer. as for the dlc, i would recommend you only get them if you have the money or think there is a good sale. the community offers mods that are much more flexible, more compadable, and the mods get faster updates in general.",291.1

"another extension of the ongoing game series known as the elder scrolls. while the only other elder scroll game i have touched was oblivion, i still say skyrim is the best one so far. the game immediately throws you into the land of skyrim. for the most part, you are taught the basics of the game (how to move, attack, equip your gear etc) early on. however, after you finish the tutorial (really, it was more just getting accustomed to the game rather than teaching you vital things), youre given infinite choices. there are no chains holding you back from doing what you please. whether you want to start leveling up your professions, following the main story line, going questing, or simply traversing the land of skyrim is all to your own discretion. what i simply love about this game is that there are no limits put on what you are (un)able to do. the only downside to all this is the bugs you will inevitably come across. despite all of that though, i still find this a great game.",121.3

"probably one of the best games ever created, despite the fact that i like games where things like relationship or other things like managing stuff are very slightly noticeable in this game, this game in a nutshell makes for good fun, a very interesting workshop and loads and i mean loads! of choices or faction related stuff are all here all in all buy it for a great experience, and the dlcs will have its advantages too",92.1

"well, it is next game in very popular rpg series the elder scrolls from bethesda. it is really amazing game for rpg lovers. open world, two handed combat system and leveling systems are just great. you can also craft a lot of stuff. you can simpy do whatever you want, buy a house, marry a wife or just go to dungeon and kill them all in. i can strongly recommend this game. ps: if you wish to improve graphic experience, just visit skyrimnexus and download some mods. ;-)",115.6

"my friends are all out playing dayz, and what do i get? skyrim duty this has to be one of my favourite ever games, although i admit my playing hours do not back that up so much. none the less skyrim is nothing less then brilliant. ive never really understood the meaning of immersion until i played this game, the sandbox freedom coupled with the sheer beauty of the landscape, the lore that follows the series is incredibly detailed and just enhances the entire experience. the quests are incredibly varied, though the dungeons do become a little repetitive at times, and as good as the voice acting is, the ai do repeat themselves a lot throughout the game. a friend of mine recently introduced me into the realm of modding skyrim textures and it doesnt stop there. the texture mods, though load heavy for pcs, are absolutely stunning, they turn what was already a beautiful game into something that makes real life look like a 2d scroller from the 90s. there are an huge range of mods from quests to map additions and even to realism mods, making the game virtually unable to bore you. i could go on and on about how this game deserves your attention, but i cant be bothered, so i will leave it like this: if you enjoy sandbox games, and you have not played any elder scrolls game before, give skyrim a go! 10/10",65.3

"this is a spactacular game that never fails to keep me on my toes, as even when adventuring, you can get all kinds of messages from people, daedra, and all other sorts of things can happen. not to mention the mods! the mods play a huge part in making this game 60x better than its huge amount of awesomeness was! i highly reccomend this game!",237.8
"vanilla skyrim can be juiced for hours of gameplay and is fun itself. but since this is compatible with steam workshop, it adds a whole new realm of possibilities.you can install entire quests, make dragons tameable, nearly anything.",642.1

"awesome game, totally love it. the exploring part got a little boring at first but thats my only complaint. 20/10",18.9
"theres not much to say about skyrim since everyone knows about it and what it is. its the best at being an rpg that makes you want to meticulously get everything just perfect for your character, its nuts. even after all this time ive played it, i still havent beaten the main story line because ive been too busy clearing out caves and doing really fun side quests. every gamer should play skyrim at least once in their life.",145.0
"nice rpg overall get for great rpg played on xbox but better on computer. if get bored get dlc or use this exact code after pressing the button ~ [coc qasmoke] use this code for editor room get everything in game and go fool around get every key, unbreakable lockpick [i think] if not still a good lockpick for some chests. everything so use this code to open the world and all items. if u get dlc they have an area where u go in editor room and there are a few chests inside a door w/ all dlc items in them.",36.4

"buy it, all i can say. buy it. my sole reason for initially buying the game was for a first person open world rpg and was surprised to find a game i could sink so much time into that i cant find a joke to pair the sentence with. mods make the world a better place and youd be doing yourself a favor to take part in the simplistic ways of mods.",470.1
"although you dont get lost in exploration like morrowind you do have loads of fun clearing out dungeons, camps, good story for the most part and fun combat learning to mix and match armor, weapons, magic attacks and defense spells. also, the modder community adds hundreds of more hours worth of playtime and enjoyment to the game.",1434.4

"9.5/10 because there are some bugs but yeah they dont cause any problem. an awesome game tho, you can spent hours in it and dont get bored.",7.3
"this is one of the best rpgs that i have played in a while. this game has a huge land to explore with suprises everywhere. there might be a vampire attack on a city or a giant destroying almost everything in its path. the weapons have a great variety and a good feal to everyone of them, so does the armour and the armour is especially noticible when fighting or running. you lose more stamina and run slower when wearing heavy armour, and the opposite wehn wearing light. there are a few bugs the annoy me but i was so carried away with the absolute beauty of this game. this game is amazing and has a giant modding community with it. 9.5/10",73.8
"this game is epic, it has evrey playstyle. craft potions and poisons,craft a weapon and enchant it to youre liking, this game was worthy of 400+ hours i have spent, the work shop adds to its delight,weapon mods,quest mods, house mods,and evrey other mod you can think of,even a goat simulator mod. i still play this game after almost a year. i love skyrim.this is a masterpiece. i know this review is possibly way overdue,but its my first.",624.5
"what can really be said about this game that hasnt been echoed by everyone who has played this game and liked it. the graphics are vibrant and detailed. the world is massive and filled with personality (well, when youre on quests that involve those characters anyways). the gameplay is tight and vastly improved from the clunky mess that was oblivions combat system. the mods add hours among hours of gameplay to the already expansive experience. all in all, the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazing game that will devour your life and lead to hours and hours of fun, so id recommend this title highly, with eveything given to you and how much this game will last, its well worth the price. not even mentioning the dlc, which extends the amount of fun content with vampire lords, a more extensive houselife, and a return to an island off the coast of morrowind. buy it, assuming you havent already!",174.6
"theres only ever a few games that truly standout amongst the rest and this is one of them. although it is just over 3 years old its still got a huge dedicated fanbase, especially on pc with all the mods, texture upgrades etc. mind the few bugs that you can come across, which never broke the game for me it is still a very solid game and still looks immense with all the mods in place. well worth a buy and well worth playing again and again even if it is just so you can play around with mods and decapitate some poor bloke in the woods.",71.1
"this is perhaps the most overhyped in all of video game history, the voice acting and plot of the game are very weak, the combat and movement system make it feel like youre a floating camera stuck on a grid like wolfenstein 3d, the combat is shallow and unsatisfying, the -not so radiant- ai is embarassing for a single player only game, and quite frankly the only redeeming feature is that its a hiking simulator without a learning curve so even the most simple minded and talentless individuals can feel special as -the one- -the only- -dragonborn-. and yet it seems to really bother with such a game, you probably need to be a different type of special, not so much in the sense of being important, but rather incapable of thinking for yourself and spending a few seconds to find one of thousands of games that are far superior gameplay wise. oh wait, theres another redeeming feature, the atmosphere, so you can feel like a giant manchild without the need of a weird diaper fetish.",14.5
"if you havent gotten this game yet, get it. my hours on steam dont do justice, ive put well over 2,000 hours on this game on the ps3. the game is massive, and every inch of it is filled up with something to do. every playthrough is different. you wont get bored.",13.9
"this is going to be sweet and simple. its a fun game, get it.",33.2
"kudos to bethesda on the phenominal job they did putting together skyrim. as has been stated before, hours and hours of extra game play and a seemingly endless supply of quests and things to discover. the only problem ive seen is that the game doesnt pace itself well once you get up in levels. by the time you reach level 30 or so, and if youve got the right combination of weapons and armor, you are pretty much invincible. and on up to level 50, no enemy stands a chance in skyrim to beat you. it can easily get to the point where there is no challenge and is mostly just grind.",276.1

"not just one of the best elder scrolls games of all time, but one of the best and most expansive single player rpgs ever made. 2014, years later, the graphics still hold their own and the game is a marvel to behold. it can be a bit frustrating simply being thrown into this large sandbox, and some may feel lost and undirected in this vast landscape, but the journal and compass will guide you to victory. magic is a bit less potent thant it should be at high levels, and all weapons (bows, swords, axes, hammers, one or two handed) when combined with smithing and enchanting are a bit overpowered. in the end though, you will come to love this corner of tamriel, it is the ultirmate adventure rpg, enough said. stop reading this review, go get tes v skyrim. let me also reccomend a bunch of smim packs for better graphics and frostfall, as well as imps more complex needs if you want to eat/sleep/freeze.",48.2

"a classic. when i first played this game on xbox i loved it, but after about 90 hours into a single playthrough, i began to feel that it might be too big. what i came to understand after playing it agian on xbox and on pc now is that the insane amount of content in this game will insure future unique playthroughs, probably for years to come. freedom is the theme and freedom you have. there are so many systems that cater to your playstyle, and the combat is fun and can be challenging on higher difficulty levels. voice acting is excellent. the game is beautiful. youll catch yourself occasionally stopping to look out on top of a mountain over a vista and its gorgeous view. the soundtrack is amazing. jeremy soule outdid himself on this one. some of the finest classical pieces ive ever heard. beautiful sound to go with a beautiful game. the main storyline is solid and there are many side quests that arguably have as rich dramatic content. if you enjoy dark fantasy rpgs, the edler scrolls v: skyrim is a must play. this review does not do the game justice.",125.8

"lets be honest here, tesv is probably and will remain one of the best games of all times. various enemies, multiple perk trees, random encounters , tons of quests, tons of loot, high quality dlc and the possibility to install quest/apparel/spells/weapons/pets/houses/etc. from mods make this game a highly enjoyable game wich will consume your hours 10/10.",88.7

"is there anyone on the internet who doesnt know at least something about skyrim? now, the main gripe people have is that skyrim needs serious mod work to be enjoyable. ive done bugger all (aside from running around with anduril for a while...) and ive got like 70 odd hours so far. no, i didnt even mod the ui. is the ui bad? it annoys me at times! is the combat bad? its a bit shallow, too hack n slash. do either of these things or any other complaints i might have stop me from playing it? no, not at all. skyrim is an rpg in the most basic sense - you create a character and you go play with them. most of the fun i have from skyrim isnt from the gameplay itself, but the emergent gameplay - the thought of my unlikely adventurer hacking off a trolls face, thinking well that was close and then the look on his face when another two come storming around the corner. or cutting someone free only for them to try to run away at which point i run them down and hack their legs out with a greatsword. or sneaking through a bandit-infested cave dispatching all the guards with a single arrow to the head like some weird crouching version of legolas. skyrim is about the stories you create, and theres enough in the world to give you a bit of a head start.",82.2

"although i never bought the game until recently, i believe strongly that it has amazed players since it came out! having played all the previous titles, i can say that bethesda has knocked this one out of the park! it has met every mark for what i look for in an rpg styled fantasy/medieval themed game. i really appreciate the complete character customization, fully voiced npc, and general beauty accomplished thorughout all of the game: in nature, cities, and even the unpredictable attacks from bands of bandits, assasins, and thieves adds a realistic beauty that only skyrim has acheived! 9.5/10 ------- please keep it up! i am very eager to see if the elder scrolls vi rumours are true and what improvements that bethesda can bring to this magnificent series then. keep up the great work! - game reviewer fremm",199.7

"ill try and keep this brief. two points here: one, despite my logged steam hours in this game, i have appoximately 300 hours logged on the 360 version. that said, you can only assume this game is either crack cocaine, or highly addictive--or both, depending. two, this game set the standard for what tactical next-gen rpgs should be. when i see any mention of a sandbox rpg, im sure im not the only one to immediately compare it to skyrim (or fallout 3, respectively)--and appropriately so! skyrim is almost the perfect video game in that you can make it your own, from start to finish. you can get a sense of accomplishment one minute, and unwarranted terror the next! its possible to feel completely immersed at times, as this game aims to take you beyond what its predecessor, oblivion could or did. as i mentioned previously, i own this game (an all dlc) for the 360 console. however, seeing it priced at $13.49 for the entire bundle, i bought it up in case i wanted to give it another play-through. this is not the 360 version. this is a crisp, clean, rich, immersive, visually-ic variation of the 360 port. this really is what video games are supposed to be. go buy this .",32.0
"i feel conflicted about this game. it is fun for a good 50-70 hours, but after that time you start to realise how much of the game is copypasted or just bland dull. once you get over that big hump of gameplay and start to see the game is wide as an ocean, but deep as a puddle with nothing you do effecting really...anything. if you want to play a elder scrolls game, play morrowind. if graphics are an issue for you, play with mge. so its a fun game for ~50 hours, but after that, it isnt. so... ill reccommend the game, but advise that you play morrowind after.",120.1

"bum bum bum bum badadadum. if there was a game that would ruin your life with the same effects as crack then this would be beat only by world of warcraft. when you buy a game twice just so you can mod it you know you have a problem that can only be dealt with by years of expensive therapy. dont waste your money on that, however buy more video games to escape those problems. this game will make you question many things. things like why can horses climb up walls? or, why do dragons land just so you can kill them? it is a very thought provoking game. i plan to write all future essays that i have to write on this game and minecraft. buy this game so you can be like me!",86.3

"this game is about the best bang for your buck around. each time i sat down to play i spent so much time getting distracted from my objective to go off and explore. every corner of the map is packed with things to do and places to see. this may not be the best choice for those who value a good story in their rpgs, though. i did find that the main quest line was pretty disjointed due to the open nature of the game. in my opinion, it was a small tradeoff for the massive amount of things to do. do yourself a favor and try out some mods in the workshop, too. i found that they made the game a lot more fun!",320.3
"i was just hanging around at the bar in a tavern and accidentaly got involved in a drinking game with a guy called sam.... the next thing i know im waking up in some kinda dungeon with a woman that is rather angry at me and guess what? the exact same thing happened to me in skyrim too!!.. ok seriously i put about 300 hours into this game on the xbox360 untill it killed my console :/. a month or so ago i bought it for pc and started modding it. wow, it was great on console, but its just another level of awesome on pc after you have installed a bunch of mods. there is so much to do and distract you that at 150 hours of gameplay (currently) ive not even finished the main story missions. nor have i even looked at dragon born, dawnguard, falskaar and so on. just amazing.... the only draw back to this game is that it requires... no demands sooo much time from you. goodbye life, hello skyrim. skyrim is for the nords btw ;)",387.9

"i would say this is a great game. the one caveat is that dawngaurd is very broken. before the game loads turn it off in options if its your first playthrough. vampires killed everyone in whiterun and half of the rest of the npcs before i was able to finish half the quests in that dlc. the vampires kill everyone, bland npcs, kids, merchents, quest granting npcs--- everyone. after removing the dlc from options in the launch menu the game is a 9/10. with dawngaurd i wouldnt give it a 2/10.",163.3
"ever dreamt about a fantasy novel coming alive, without the really cheap plastic weapons and bag cg effects, that is what skyrim is to me, a world i wish i could live in. we waited a long time for skyrim but it was worth it, the elder scrolls series never fails to take over your life, anyone who games has to play skyrim, even if they are a fps monkey it has to be tried.",22.6

"imho the best title in the whole series as of yet. if you liked any of the previous elder scrolls games, this is a must have! remember to install the unofficial bug fix patches to the vanilla game and all of the dlcs before starting to avoid any game breaking bugs. too bad they have left out the randomly generated terrain for the later titles in the series, including this one. i really liked that feature about the first two games; arena and daggerfall.",270.7

"the elder scrolls: skyrim is a game, wich you cannot describe with words. skyrim is a nice place, with lots quests to aquire and complete with style. also, skyrim, as a game is incredibly customizable experience, since you can build your own hero as you want it to be. you can choose to be bad or good, and choose your own behaviour and things you do. also the combat system and customization is incredibly advanced and stylish. you wish to be an archer in long distance combat, and a heavy melee on close combat, be my guest, skyrim will be the place to do it. the graphics of skyrim are very nice and realistic but there are many modifications in workshop wich will allow the higher end computers to use the lost power and make skyrim even better on the graphics and realism. and last but not least, i would recommend skyrim to any gamers that wish to get a good storyline, an action filled adventurous medieval simulator :d",63.9

"where to start... writing a serious review on this will take hours. hours and hours. just accept it is either the best, or one of the best fantasy epics ever created. buy it with or without dlc, pc is the best due to the mods. they make it a true lovable game. 10/10 no doubt.",586.4

"it is hard not to recommend skyrim. it is a large game and has so much to do in it. i have beaten everything in the game including all the repeating quests and i still have plenty to explore. bethesda did go all out with the world in this game. i just wish the world was a bit more alive. i wish there were more dragons and more animals and stuff to do on the outside world. the dungeons are great and have plenty to do. the problems i stated can easily be fixed with the hundreds of mods. i played the game vanilla most of the game than i added mods and it turned out to be incredible. i just used the mods from the steam workshop cause they are super easy to use and bam, the games is instantly better. buy it and this game is always on sale so you can save a pretty penny if you wait.",552.8

"goes without saying that this is an all around perfect game",81.9
"chargggggggggging up my fireball !!!!!! this game is really fun and great game to kill npc but not all of them. really fun game with magic , swords and an arrow to the knee. gets better the more you play. starts a bit slow in the beginning. there is many other mods to make this game a bit better when done with the main story, many sidequest that makes great drama other than just killing everything you see. 8 out of 10",101.6

"really fun, really open. the only thing i wasnt too happy about was the good/bad split wasnt always right. every action was a little bit good and a little bit bad in weird ways, and it always felt like there should be other options that the game simply didnt even acknowledge. there was no option to buy out the assassins guild to take out the blackbriars and liberate riften, or reach the top of the thieves guild, and use that to curb their excesses and teach them not to s%@1 where they eat. the game, vanilla, is still like hundreds of hours of awesome fun, and then the steam workshop makes it easy to add hundreds more.",75.0
"get this game.its good, plus dragons. youll lose all friends, family, and connections with the outside world, but you will thoroughly enjoy this game. storyline is good ,plus dragons. combat is good, ai is good and really hard on master. especially if you play master from the very beginning. graphics are stunning even on low. the workshop makes this game amazing and helps adds countless hours of game-play after the story and all the quests are completed. plus dragons. magic i think is fluid though some disagree. map is hugemongus (very large). very detailed. sounds and music are ing ic. cons: i have no more friends. it isnt multiplayer. but neither of these matter because dragons.",658.2
"yes, this game was a lot of fun...for the short time that i played it. im going to play it again one day, once i can wipe off my fear of thos freaking frostbite spiders!!!! *ahem* the story and characters are really intreguing, and the cameplay mechanic, while simple at first, gets a lot more fun as your progress. and its still easy to pick up the controler and play.",1.5
"so what to say about skyrim..... just that its one of the best rpg games iv played in a long time(since oblivion now that i think on it). loads of content to keep yourself busy for over 200+ hours and that is without mods! adding mods after the inital playthrough really sparks things off again. you could easily spend 1000+ hours on this game and it would always be new and exciting. the main problem is the combat, it seems very lack luster at times, usualy just mash/hold attack until enemy dies which does get a tad boring.",334.9
"i just got skyrim i guess my friends wont be seeing me for a long tim",49.5
"im still playing this game with the same level of enjoyment since it came out. the variety of mods in the community extend the life of the vanilla game so much that the game wont ever get stale.",46.4

"one of the only games that got me so hooked, i barely noticed the days of the week go by. incredibly open world,versatile and great controls. an incredibly fun game made even more fun by the use of mods. a game where you will always find soemthing new, even after many years. 9.9/10",83.5
"if you dont own, play and love skyrim i just dont understand. i think youre doing it wrong.",212.0
"this is one of the best games ive played. it has a very large world and lots of weapons enchantments and spells not to mention shouts. if you get this game then there is one mod that you must get no matter what just search thomas download the trains mod and be prepared to die by flying firebreathing trains from your childhood.",7.7
"skyrim. what can i say about this game. probably the best rpg i have ever played, graphics are amazing, story is pretty good and game mechanics are amazing, and with new mods being released each week, it gets more awesome by the day. there is just one complaint i must make, and that is the main storyline, if this game had the quality storyline that oblivion provided, then it would be a perfect game. the elder scrolls is one of the best series out there (if you ignore eso) and this game proves this. 9/10",53.0
"i had put a couple hundred hours into the ps3 version and just got it for pc. with the wealth of mods, im quite sure this will keep me busy for a long time. this game is probably my all time favorite.",43.9

"skyrim is a great game. i recomend this to everybody.",59.3
"this game is bad, because it promotes witchcraft, magic and fake gods called princes promoting that their actually demons in disguise and their all bad, then it promotes sexism because its fanbase who have nothing to do with the game at all make sex mods and gun mods, guns are bad, and you can do hardcore drugs in this game and then it has animal men, thats fake and who the hell plays animal wo/men, its all witchcraft. and then theres drinking beer, beer is super bad because you can get high off beer okay, and btw call of duty is better than this bad game. this game is a rip off of call of duty",181.1
"the.. best... game... ever made! nothing more to say. if you like first person or 3rd person games.. if you like fun.. just buy the f%$#ing game. everyone should own this. there really is no need to go into detail.",153.7
"i had been skeptical for a long time before buying this game due to its extreme popularity, but a few months after its release i picked it up and found that the hype was well-worth it. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an immmensely immersive world filled with a ridiculous amount of sandbox playability. 100+ hours in and id barely scratched the surface of the main storyline and gone and done a ton of side-quests. add to this an exceptional modding community and you have a great and refreshing game that it sure to provide a ton of replay value. critiques include dialogue thats made to be immersive, but the lack of variety in random dialogue only hounds the fact that this is a video game instead of a live world, some texture and model issues that can be easily fixed with new mods (if you have a good computer), and some random gameplay and quest glitches (also fixable through some community patches). overall the this doesnt overly detract from the mood of the game, and this entry in the series has definitely made me a bigger fan of the series in general.",14.2
"skyrim is a fantastic open world fantasy sandbox with numerous things to do and numerous more with easy access to various mods that usually improve upon the vanilla experience. as far as an rpg goes skyrim falls flat with there being very little consequence for just about anything you do or any choice you make and whilst the open ended perk system is welcome it can take away what challenege, depth and immersion tes:v has to offer unless one choses to restrict themselves. as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle.",211.3
"one of the best games ever. especially with mods...",24.1
"i love this game so much the gameplay is great, the only ploblem is that it continues to force close on my computer... thinking its just a glitch in the system because my computer doesnt show any signs of struggle while running the game.",309.0
"i mean love bethesda game fallout 3 ,new vegas ,morrowind but this game tops the charts.i played this on the xbox for a unhealthy time then when i got onto the pc and got modding my experience was changed so much in my opinion modding makes skyrim amazing so if you havent played this game yet what the hell is wrong with you buy it now",162.0

"what is there left to say about skyrim? just epic. the best modern fantasy open-world rpg yet - not counting beloved classics. a must have for any genre and rpg fan and a massive time sink... also the bad monster scaling from tes:oblivion was fixed. and endless mods from other players to play around with and explore. also you meet the man who used to be an adventurer like you until he got an arrow in the knee.",422.2
"honestly, this game remains as the best game ive ever played. if youve never played it, youre missing out big time gameplay - 11/10 this game is extremely enjoyable all the time. graphics - 9/10 you can easily improve this with mods but i think vanilla skyrim is beautiful too. replayability - 10/10 i made countless new games just because i wanted to roleplay. i didnt care that i had to do all the quests again because they were so enjoyable. if you havent bought it already, buy it. it beats any newer game ive seen on steam.",155.4

"compared to oblivion this game is a vast improvement, very detailed and i would highly recomend it to anyone who has played any of the elder sscrolls series or whom enjoys rpg games. i give it a well deserved 9 - 10 since there are still some game bugs but its otherwise a very good game.",113.5

"i hated it, it sucked why does it exist. 10 out of 10",19.0
"skyrim is the perfect example of how a vast and addictive adventure game is done, without overloading the player with witcher-like  complexity. you begin the game picking only your race and from then, what type of fighter you are is completely built off of how you play, making for endless possibilities of the fighter you can become. it is a poor idea to just stick to the main story all throughout, because it will leave you at a disadvantage if you ignore the varying side quests and beautiful exploration, which allow you to uncover some of the best equipment as well as enhance your skills and levels. this in turn, has given me a massive playtime of 37 hours so far and the main story still only feels like its a quarter of the way through! this is a fantastic watercooler game, allowing for you and your friends to share hours of stories about your unique adventures and play style in skyrim. if you have the system specs and you love exploration, do not miss this game!",126.5
"i have not seen the sun in ages because of this game",85.1
"with the thousands of mods out for this, it never gets old. i made vorstag my b*tch, his collar looks so good on him, not to mention hes useful in battle. and i didnt even have to marry him.",8.3
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played. its also in the steam top 10 most played games ! if you dont own a skyrim, get it now ! you wont regret your money. the game itself is an adventure, the main story line is so long + a lot of amazing side quests and dlcs. once you will finish the game you can download tons of mods for more quests/monsters/armors/weapons... 10/10",130.2
"this is my favourite game for a number of reasons. it has an unlimited supply of activities to keep the gamer occupied, including hundreds of quests, buy houses, build houses, explore catacombs, get married, adopt kids, hunt dragons and you have the ability to travel to other areas (if you have purchased dlc) and experience new worlds. i enjoy many aspects of the game and i have come to appreciate its fine details more and more time i spend playing it.overall its worth every penny and even after two years im still at it. i have completed the game and started over 4 times; each time with a character of a different race and different playing-style. each time, the gaming experience is so different and enjoyable. love it! 5/5!",185.4

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a great game, which you can play the way you want to. role-play, modding, or just walking around the world, this game has practically no end to it, as there are endless possibilities. one of my favourite games i have played! 10/10 would play again :d",20.8
"almost as good as oblivion. can be hard later on, but there are tons of things to do and discover ;) if its on a sale get it asap.",26.5
"when it comes down to it, this is a quintessential aaa rpg that any fan of the genre should have. are there better games out there? probably. does it have flaws? sure. but with the workshop and the three years worth of mods on nexus anyone can tailor the game to fit their needs and have a good time with skyrim. tes games are always great on their own to a certain extent, but what really makes a bethesda rpg shine is the modding. i bought this back in 2011 when it first came out and ive yet to make a signifigant dent in the main story purely because i got lost in sidequest and mods. granted, i ended up breaking the game with those mods mulitple times leading to several hiatuses. its fun, get it.",172.1
"the elder scrolls is one of my favorite series of games, and skyrim goes beyond my expectations. i enjoy playing this game, and i look forward to playing with the dlc. in skyrim, i love the open world environment, characters, graphics, soundtrack, quests, and story. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing fantasy rpgs.",75.9

"skyrim is possibly the best game i have ever played. it is so easy to lose yourself in the game. it is so worth buying the dlc for it too. i am currently in the middle of the dawnguard dlc and i can tell you that the storyline it adds is both long and interesting, allowing you to travel with a vampire companion through most of it and giving you several chances to become a vampire, if you so desire.",42.9

"heres to developers at least not screwing with the best features the elder scrolls is known for, maybe the game wasnt what some were expecting, but i challenge someone to show me how this isnt just another awesome installment, in a series people love the world over, you can call on dragons to aid you in battle, do i really need to say any more?",434.0
