"i have been an avid elderscrolls gamers since daggerfall and this game has usurpt my life. i love this game! even though they have in my opinion, over simplified some things in the game and combined a few, its very hard to fault this game. you have so many playing styles and you take the souls of dragons and learn many different ways to use them to shout fire, ice or call down a storm!",852.0
"the best elder scrolls game and the easiest to play. the replayability is high as you try different things. note that you will need that 1gb video card and quadcore or higher cpu just to play this game. the only drawback is the menu interface, but there are mods for that. i also highly recommend all 3 expansions (dawnguard to increase the peril; dragonborn to add item variety and eliminate gameplay annoyances (such as friendly fire); and hearthfire to expand your characters domestic life (and add more npcs)). although there are still a few bugs, dont be discouraged as this game with expansions is well worth $45.",625.0

"this an awesome game that never ends!! there are a lot of options so there is always something you can do. one of the best games i have played. 10/10 stars",401.5

"heres what you should do if youre reading the recomendations. scroll up. click buy. inform your family and friends you may be out of contact for a while. and play the damn game already.",176.3
"what can i even say? its skyrim! this game is extremely addicting and fun! i could play this all night and all day, heck i probably will! there is no game that can come close to the level of addicting you can only get in skyrim! 10/10",97.7
"pretty much the best game of all time, 11/10 would reccomend",133.0
"i have lost way too many hours on this game. it is fun, engaging, and with the modding options, almost limitless play time... worth every single moment",122.1
"this g... hell. you dont need me to recommend this. its skyrim.",146.5
"vikings. dragons. epic elder scrolls music. if i could see my feet when i looked down in first person i would most likely never play another game ever.",128.6
"i love this game! :d i just need to learn to do a game without uding any cheats. (ill do that on my second playthrough)",159.0
"theres dragons and goats and talking dragons and non talking goats; overall this game is cooler than your mothers floral print granny panties. buy it now!",246.1
"full of tons of fun, adventure, and complete kick- mods in the steam workshop!!!",258.8
"draugr dungeon simulator 2011 - if you want a good game that doesnt just throw you into dungeons and that actually has difficulty, play dark souls 2.. if you want better quests then play oblivion or morrowind... this is a sad excuse for an elder scrolls game and basically threw the good things that iii and iv did out the fufkin window. if you still want to get this game, get some mods for it, its the only way it doesnt become a repetitive peice of garbage. by about 1hr into the game you will be thinking oh great another dragon to kill, this is so thrilling or oh, so i have to go to this draugr dungeon to finish the quest... its so pointless without mods that fix it",79.3
"in my opinion this game is an awesome rpg with a pretty good story line and lots of open world gameplay and locations to discover with side quests that will keep you occupied and lots of diffrent mods you can download to make the game even better.in the main quest line you play as the dragonborn on your quest to stop the dragons and alduin, the dragon that is bringing the other dragons back to life.and with the dragonborn and dawnguard dlc it adds extra quest lines that that can be longer than the main quest line.so i just think the game is really fun.",84.3
"8/8 gr8 m8 bandits captured my wife... i let them keep her she was a hoe anyway all she wanted was my money",23.5
"once all the hype died down and i started replaying skyrim i noticed a lot of flaws with the game that werent apparent to me when i initially played it. while the gameplay of skyrim is a necessary improvement over oblivion and fallout it just lacks a lot of depth that even oblivion had. the lack of classes really makes every character you play as feel similar, and the lack of restrictions or stats means you can play a thief in heavy armor and justify it by the game just not caring. indeed the questlines are interesting the first time around but the lack of the ability to fail them or indeed decide an alternate route makes them really tedious the second or third time. it makes them feel very shallow, and it doesnt help theres only maybe 7 of them before you are automatically promoted to the head of the specific guild you joined. the games pretty great the first time you play it but i really dont look upon skyrim as well as i used to. the shallow content really rings true once youve tried replaying the game and the interesting dungeon aesthetic only points out how you go in a straight line in all of them.",428.7
"hours upon hours of gameplay. especially worth it if you pick it up on a steam sale. get the legendary edition to get all the dlc (hours upon hours more gameplay)",295.7
"one of my favourite games of all time. there is so much to do in this game and the mods also add so much into it making the already amazing game even better than it already is",65.4
"one of the top five games that ive had the priviledge of playing... the only thing that i would say that gets old about this game is the voices (they can get reppetative after 60+ hours in it).",178.3
"im going to attempt to say everything you can do in skyrim. if you have not played skyrim yet, sit back and read. okay, in the elder scrolls v: skyrim... you can: -kill dragons -get paid by nobles to kill bandits. -scream words of power. -travel to the top of the highest mountain. -defeat the king of dragons. -summon a dragon to fight for you. -go fishing. -eat cabbages. -go farming. -get a house (of many choices). -decorate the house. -get married. -have a wedding. -adopt children. -listen to annoying guards. -decimate small rabbits. -use swords. -greatswords. -use battleaxes. -regular axes. -frickin magic. -a -load of other weapons. -become a thane. -get arrested for stealing a plate. -get marauded for killing a chicken in town. -become a vampire. -become a werewolf. -ride a horse. -become an assassin. -kill the emperor. -become a thief. -live in the sewers. -get drunk. -kill witches. -alchemy. -join the war. *loud gasp for air* now keep in mind, this is about 3/4 of whats in the normal game. there are also dlcs, mods, tuns of stuff! 10/10. buy this game now!",63.5
"conclusion on why this game is worth buying: 1. delicious sweetrolls. 2. space program with the giants. 3. cabbages. 4. hide and seek with the dead. 5. chicken. 6. physics-defying horses. 7. have i mentioned cabbages? 8. fresh products in ancient caves/dungeons. 9. totally-not-annoying immortal children. 10. mmmm skooma mmmmm 11. fus ro dah!!",186.3
"everyone knows this amazing game, and if you dont then id like to see the impressive boulder you are living under.",199.1
"skyrim is one of those games that you can sink many hours into. the vanilla game provides ample adventure for you to partake in, while the continually growing community mods (found on the steam workshop, nexus, etc) adds additional options. the graphics may originally be somewhat bland in areas, but can be easily upgraded with user-created mods that enhance textures greatly (as long as your pc can handle) definitely a good buy, especially during the current sale ($17 for the legendary edition)",420.2
"this game only stops being fun once your computer cant handle any more mods... but then you just delete some and start again!!! :d",210.7
"this game is 1 of the best games i have played with a great storyline and graphics. looking forward to the mmo eso",1069.7
"ill admit, i was late to this game(picking it up in june this year). good fun nonetheless, with the modding community being very active adding many hours of gameplay. while not as complex as true rpgs, it still offers a decent size world to explore with many side quests and half decent characters.",98.1
"awesome game with a good story, wonderfull landscapes and epics fights. there are enough things to do to never get borred of this game -150h played, still not done (130 before purshasing on steam)- . if you have to do some choices in this game that will influence the way pnc sees you, you may also choose between your grades and this game. good luck on the land of skyrim !",33.1
"a game unlike anyother, and one that tops my list regardless of age or error. it is a masterpiece and will stay that. it is, as p0rtalplay3r would say. a truly great",389.3
"obviously skyrim is a phenomenal game, but specifically, the pc version is incredible. the modding community for this game is insane. the mods will do anything from improve routine aspects of the game that bethesda should have in the first place, to introduce new amazing features, or just fun . i saw a mod today that literally changes the dragons to thomas the train. the roars are train whistles. thats the level of modding depth there is to this game. its absurd. if youre going to play skyrim, you should be playing it on pc. if you have a pc capable of playing it, and you purchased a console copy, you made a horrible mistake.",69.1
"one of the joyable rpgs ive played and cant wait for elder scrolls online, and all the expansions for skyrim along with the mods; off steam and nexus make it even more fun.",62.6
"yes, i expect to have no life at all until i finish playing this game. its that good. just get it, because otherwise you will miss out on one of the best rpg/action games of all time. the fact that you can totally customize and personalize this game with an endless array oif mods and new features should make it playable for many years to come.",2.7
"extremely addicting rpg open-world. a fantastic game. thats all you need to know. note: this game will consume your life... its a trap!!",59.7
"no doubt the best bethesda has every released. an absoute must buy for any elder scrolls fan.",166.8
"excellent game. one of the best rpgs out there! always been a huge fan of the elder scrolls series, and this one was top notch yet again!",141.1
"in all honesty, i played this game in a short period of time, i do like the storyline so far. but, geez. only 15 picklocks? at the beggining. im so bad a picking a lock in general. im basically stuck at that part now. wanting more picklocks. but opps, silly me. oh well, i like the storyline. but the graphics make the video game so laggy and stuff, which frusterates me so much! i do recommend this game, if you have an actual good hardwired computer.",1.2
"if you liked fallout 3, im sure youll spend just as many hours playing this as well. ive placed many, many hours into the 360 version but i must admit, the pc version is much better. if you havent played this game, what are you waiting for? i am 100% positive that you will love it as much as i do. step one: buy this game! step two: tell your loved ones that youre going to be busy for a while. step 3: play skyrim. step 4: enjoy what this virtual world has to offer! step 5: try to sleep for work. step 6: dont get fired. reminder: dont forget to shower. tl;dr? - buy this game and dont let it impact your life in a negative way.",13.6
"you will spend a stupid amount of time on this game if youre a completionist like this guy",76.0
"awesome story, got sucked into it! - mods are also insane fun!",114.6
"a beautiful game with potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay. featuring engaging stories to follow and many secrets to discover.",510.0
"this game is okay, i guess. i mean, 100+ hours of gameplay, lot of mods, open world, varied combat options, etc. meh.",46.1
"i love this game. ive spent tons of time finding all the little things in the game and it continues to keep me entertained. the only thing i would say theyre lacking is the main story quest isnt very interesting or epic and the voice acting is extremely repetitive.",153.2
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"skyrim its an incredible game. aside from the fact that the game just bursts quite literally with content, its is unique atmosphere that truly draws you into playing it. this mixture between the actual game and steams workshop manages to add even more to an already fantastic experience, achieving fixes and overall improvements that allow you to create your own personal experience with the game. dont like the available armors? change them! dont like how many dragons are in the area? change it too! you have the freedom to explore a world that goes beyond your fondest memories and fantasies of the medieval, magical, fantastical times, a world where there are no rules, a world that its alive.",63.5
"looking for an rpg with endless content? skyrim offers a ton of mods through its community . if you are new to the series or just finished playing oblivion this game is for you either way, it brings a new experience to the gaming world and you wont be dissapointed.",105.7
"very immersive eye appealing world. pretty good storyline (if you choose to follow it). tons of quests, lots of versatility in the combat system...overall a great game that youll definitely spend a ton of time on. just dont yell at the chickens. dont do it.",28.4
"this game is worth it. right now you can got everything for the game for $20. without mods its a great game with a lot of base content to enjoy, ill emit with some glitches and bugs. but with mods, this game is a wonderland of fun, with so much to do its overwhelming how much content there is. this game is easily a 8/10, a must buy, if you havent bought it already.",68.0
"amazing. of course that such a huge and complex world also has lacks some elements but it more than compensates through others ... if you want to know what im talking about, play the game - its worth it",208.0
"in this episode of the elder scrolls, the dragon born copes with his addiction to killing things.",246.4
"fricken awsome!!!! if you have steam you should have this game.",242.6
"this game is in my personal top 10. i have owned it on all 3 platform,s beat it uncountible times and to this day still enjoy playing it. if you dont own it get it asap",340.3
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is my favourite game of all time. for potential buyers, skyrim is an open-world rpg that positions you as the dragonborn. your quest is to save the world from imminent destruction by slaying dragons. however, youre also free to do as you like. from trading with caravans, killing the undead draugr or even jsut cooking, there is a lot to do. despite the large amount of glitches, as bethesda games often have, they wont take away from your experience. on top of this, theyre also quite generous with dlc by providing entirely new weapons, skills and playable areas. this is just vanilla skyrim! once you use mods, anything can happen! i cannot recommend skyrim enough.",68.2
"its great and it will make any other game like oblivion look like  even with mods",142.5
"its like the best rpg in the world at the moment, the world is vast with loads of quests. it is so good in many ways that, if i should write everything down here, you would ask me for a tl;dr. definetily worth buying, you wont need another game for weeksto come if you have this!",652.0
"greatest game i have ever played... thank you and continue the fight!",164.5
"could not recommend more. i dont know why you dont have this game already",40.9
"ruined my life with crack version, just bought legal ver to support the company (summer sale ofc lol)",4.4
"this game is awesome and with so many mods it literally has no end to the questline. overall i would say it was money well spent and was not one bit disappointed with any aspect of the gameplay or graphics. 10/10",142.7
"very great game. althought people can cheat by the ~ tool, but thats really the only downfall. 4.5/5",4.7
"played about 600+ hours on the xbox 360 edition back in 2011. it was an immense improvement over the already legendary tes3:oblivion. i put off buying the pc version purely because i was being stingy with money and saw little sense in buying the same game again. i could not have been more wrong. not played much, but have modded the living snot of the game already and cannot wait to relive this timeless game once more. buy it.",35.4
"for one who have played the elder scrolls since the beginning of the series gotta say that this is a very good game, free roaming and lots of stuff to do all the time. if you are bored whit the quest line, fine then just try another one or do some random killing.",335.7
"a great way to waste a few months and if your lucky you wont end up with as many broken quests as me",154.7
"one of the best open world games ever. has hours of gameplay and hours more if you do the side quests. all its dlc is fun and you should buy the legendary version. its also easily modable and the mods bring more fun to the already fun game plus the mods on external sites like the skyrim nexus brings more easily installed fun, also space core mod cant beat that.",401.1
"the game was very injoyable even from the start you have an feel of adventure and whant explore the entire world even the places that dont involve any quest.",567.8
"you know what this is game about, i dont really need to write this review other than to tell you too get a few mods that increase visuals, trust me do it!",84.8
"the best game hundred of hundred hours to entertainment, really captivating, complex with dozens of mods and dlc to expand an already massive world",136.1
"a perfect follow up to oblivion, this game is seriuosly addicting!",141.1
"if u have soul by this game. if u dont, buy watch_dogs",39.7
"i love the exploration in this game, but bethesda just doesnt seem to invest enough time in their games. the biggest lack is the poor npc interaction, too many fetch quests, lack of impact of your actions on the world, and especially your overpoweredness after a while. especially when they want to make a realistic fantasy enviroment, please dont make the character so overpowered, and the hp of the ennemies is just over the top high. bashing ten thousand times at an ennemy is really annoying, and especially the outdated meele system should be improved. the player just doesnt seem to be involved in the world too much. the game is just spamming stuff whitout actually making it really good. sure it has nice graphics, great world, a good leveling up system and such, and i really think this game is very good, but it could be so much better wit one more year of development.",77.3
"skyrims a lot of fun, with a lot to do. the amount of time you spend on skyrim depends on how much you explore. go straight through the main missions, and dare i say, youre playing it the wrong way. but there really isnt a wrong way to play this game. you want to play a thief, you can. you want to play a thief, warrior, who steals everything then runs in front of everybody. well, that doesent make much sense, but you can. you want to play as a dragon, well you cant, but you can do stuff that dragons do..... the amount of content in this game is downright amazing. you could play it for one hundred and fifty hours, and you might not know half of it. it really is an amazing game. (note, i havent played any of the other elder scrolls games. i dont know how they compare) 10/10",232.6
"having never played an elder scrolls game, i was admittedly skeptical of skyrims hype. in retrospect, my skepticism was not justified. this game... well, this universe is insanely huge. there are so many quests, books and dialog options. its 100x better than the best book ive ever read, the best tv series ive ever watched. well worth your money and time. give it a shot.",142.2
"this game is the best game ever released on any platform better on console tho i have been playing this game since it cam out and i still go on it sometimes i love this game 11/10 awsome",235.4
"excellent game. the high watermark. all other rpgs struggle to match skyrim.",1.3
"skyrim is one of the most amazing games ever created! if you can get past some of the bugs (nothing game breaking) you will get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of it. being a hardcore elder scrolls fan i can honestly say without a doubt that skyrim is the best in the franchise to come to pc yet. if you are teetering on wether or not to purchase this game, just do it! you wont regret it!",619.1
"got axed to death by guards in suggestive attire after using my sword to play with a kids dog. 10/10",13.3
"my game glitched and now im stuck on a flying dragon. 10/10 would repeat",48.9
"the elder scrolls series has always been the best, but not as good as skyrim. skyrim has improvet alot and i love this game as much as i loved oblivion, it is amazing and i say that everybody should try it out at least once and they will enjoy it. i also hope that they will also write good reviews about it and that they will also enjoy it. hope you guys and girls found this review helpful and has encurigded you to play the game.",298.8
"the vanilla game is okay, but not exactly my cup of tea... i dont prefer hack-n-slash types of games. but when you add in some of the available mods the game can do all sorts of things. i really like the exploration.",22.5
"i have no idea what i am even playing. is this even a game, or is it random madness? i assume there are multiple levels, but i cant even figure out what to do in the first level, which is a horrible asteroids type game where an anime girl is ranting bible quotes at you. from reading some more the intent was to make a supposed old bad bible game -- well, they succeeded absolutely. 0/10 jesus is a prick",391.8
"wow come on lets do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",742.2
"fantastic game. expansive environment 100s of hours of game play",164.7
"adore this game, played 200 hours of hearthfire unmodded game and then more modded with dlc and it still manages to surrprise. truly and utterly fantastic. though when playing again i suggest to get skyrim unbound.",263.1
".                    10/10 such dragonborn much recommend",27.8
"the only reason i can really recommend this game is because the modding community is the only community still holding this game together, apart from the dlc this game isnt too interesting at its core. as to whether its rushed, or just generally lazily designed i wouldnt honestly know. its functional; has its fair share of bugs and glitches, but is still playable right to the end. personally i dont like elder scroll games, but thanks to the modding community this game actually becomes somewhat enjoyable. so download nexus mod manager and turn a solid 5/10 game, into around a 7-8/10! thank you nexus mod manager for making games playable again! :)",75.9
"best rpg ever. only bad thing is that it is bugged as hell so you will have to use mods. still greatness of this game easily overshadows such flaw.",110.2
"one of the best rpgs of this generation, building off the success of morrowind and oblivion, this game does the elder scrolls series justice and its a good intro to the series. the character customization is great, letting you play one of many races or classes. do you want to play as a fireball-casting lizard? a boxing cat wearing chainmail armor? an orc with poison tipped daggers sneaking in the shadows? go for it. the choice is yours to make. with a huge storyline and many side quests, this game is sure to make that $30 (or what have you) completly worth it. just stop reading this already and buy it.",11.7
"can be like colonel mustang (for those who know him). read the argonian maid 11/10.",128.7
"theyve finally been able to make a video game that works just like crack-cocaine!",126.3
"one of the best games i have ever played. 3 years of having the game and im still learning and finding stuff to do in skyrim! would recommend 10/10",707.2
"10/10 - immersive, massive, and already cannonical",557.9
"amazing game you wont reget buying this game, huge modding community. sure the game has bugs but can solved by using console commands",288.0
"its simple if you dont own this you should. prepare to lose many many many hours to the quests involved. this is one game that always feels worth the investment!! great story involved character line and just fun to play",128.9
"10/10 to be honest! a truly fantastic gaming experience i recommend for anyone! the graphics, storyline, and gameplay is beyond spectacular! the game is truly worth getting. this is a definately a game to play to eliminate the feeling of bored.",160.3
"i dont need to babble on and on about how amazing this game is but i might anyways. from stunning graphics to the never-ending list of well-thought-out quests, a gazillion places to explore and always able to pretty much find new things all the time... not to mention how you play changing from character to character with several races to choose from, each having unique traits and powers. if you want to slice-and-dice or simply blow someone into dust with your godly mage skills--or an unpredictable, powerful mix of brawn and magic-- i doubt youll ever get bored of this game. as the game expands endlessly, you can customize down to the very atom of yer character if you so choose. you can follow the main plot at your own pace, if at all, while you run off becoming a champion of legend and helping out gods and people alike. go slaughter everything. just kill everything if you want. go steal someones horse, take their cheese, pickpocket them. you can be a piece of  or a valiant white knight and everything in between. skyrim is your oyster, now go  dominate in whatever way you please.",366.4
"game is very fun with nearly infinite possibilites and hours of endless fun",400.0
"finally was able to get this game for pc and i forgot what sunlight looks like. 10/10 would get lost again.",325.1
"goty right here. one of the best video games i have ever played. i honestly didnt think id get into it this much. oblivion was ok  at best so i wasnt too hyped. this caught me off guard. if you make one purchase this year, make it skyrim.",118.8
"this game has awesome graphics and a great modding community!",37.4
"this game is a true masterpiece, i might have only around 50hrs, but thats this account (might have 250 total). spent so much time building several characters and going through different quests each time, it feels like we have a second life, and its totally worth the time spent. 10/10 this game has become the standard that following games have to surpass, even if its already a couple years old.",52.4
"awesome game. when you play it you become attached and pretty much lose yourself in the mythical land of skyrim.",193.0
"from the 45 minutes ive played of this game, ive realised that i have been deprived from truly great games. the land of skyrim is like nothing ive experienced before. i cant remeber the last time ive truly felt free in a game. i have always been giving inspiration by beautiful games, but i have never experienced one of this magnitude. when a true gamer hears the term its only a game they just smile and nod. but when the truth of the matter is that these are more than games, they are an artwork. they give inspiration. they give hope. they make you someone else in a far off land. they change the view of our repetitive lives.",68.1
"i am not good at writing game reviews but here goes! this game is absolutely amazing so much to do in it and so many places to visit, even if you finish the main quest in this game there is a lot of side quest to complete and many dungeons to search. the gameplay in this game is good very responsive and simple, the way i like it. story in this game is very interesting and because of it being interesting you cant stop completing quest cause you wanna know what is going to happen next. graphics are also really good and beatiful imo. this game is also well optimized for pc because even i can play it on high settings without lagging and i have a average laptop. the final ratings for this game is 5/5, i just simply cant make anything bad about this game to decrease the score. if you want a good fantasy rpg experience then this game is for you!",176.4
"warning!! this game is verry verry addictible and if you realy want it then buy legendary edition,and yeah i recommend it because a lots of mods and big replayability.",291.8
"the trailer is so much better than the game i am reccomending this game, but i reccomend tes3-4 more. even though this game is great, it is not perfect. get oblivion, this is hype residue get oblivion, the questline is better get oblivion. its better, trust me",272.6
"9/10 highly recommended just for the freedom you get. honestly the modding potential for this game alone is probably worth more than other full-priced games. i personally liked esiv: oblivion more because the environments werent so gloomy, but this game has so much to do and such a vast collection of free mods and extensions that i dont really care. dont like the snowy, gray overworld? no problem brah, just download a mod and make windhelm look like south beach.",78.9
"a must have game, multiple choices,shape skyrim as you see fit, whatever road you choose you will have countless hours of fun.",435.0

"played through on 360, beat regular skyrim. playthrough 2 on ps3, dabbled in legendary, long way to go before complete. got legendary on pc, testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 play-throughs. especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to, ive done all these fn quests before, its great to be able to just go grab all the games keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your play-through without trivial bs. also, thomas the truck.  yeah. oh, one more thing, it looked good on 360. it looked great on ps3. it loads a billion times faster and plays way smoother on pc. got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience ive ever had.",13.3

(of coures i know whats real and whats not, im just saying the game looks really good :p) that about all i have to say about this game. me personally, id give it a 9/10. its a boss game!",101.9

"where has this game been all my life?! seriously, its one of the best games ive ever played. the world, skyrim, is so huge and you will always find stuff to do, you will always discover something new, something you havent seen before. i really dont know what to say about the game - im still so amazed at it. its just super awesome and totally worth the money since you (probably) will spend hundrets of hours in skyrim. so if you havent already: make sure to try it out one day.",282.3
"pretty average. it has the whole epic feeling going, right up until your 90th journey into a cave. given the nice overworld visuals, youd think they could have more of the actual game take place there. speaking of the overworld, there doesnt feel like theres as much of a reason to just wander like there was in earlier games. going from place to place was more of a chore than a fun little adventure. its weird because so many people complain about fast travel in oblivion because it eliminates the adventure of exploring new stuff, whereas in skyrim it feels like a necessity to avoid the horrible tedium of going from a to b with nothing but scenery porn and caves in between. all in all, if you are so completely unaware that you cant find any better games to play, then feel free to play this. personally, i regret buying it for full price. it might be worth it for like $10.",91.2

"another winner from bethesda, skyrim continues the tales of the nations of tamriel and their struggles with the servants of daedra and divine alike. while it lacks some of the fun features of morrowind and oblivion (such as creating your own spells), its a good follow-up to those famous, well-loved titles. it can drag on a bit at times, with a lot of the quests having a distinct feeling of same task, different employer, but while that can make it hard to play, if you can power through then you will not be disappointed by the game.",38.6

"where to even begin with this game. if you havent already been convinced to play this game, i will give you my reasons to why this game is a must buy. i have played this game on console and pc, and i would first like to say that you get such an incredible and immersive experience on the pc. the mods in this game enhance the game to a new level. i feel that the most important thing to look at when judging a game is the replay value, and this game will have you playing for hours on end and still have a ton of things to do. you have so many different ways to approach the game aswell, so you can always start the game over and play as a different type of character whether it be an upclose heavy armored warrior, a mage, an assasin, a thief, a combination of these, and many more! there are so many skills to master and such a vast world to discover that you will find yourself playing this game for hours without the game losing any pace. there is also alot of history in the game for you to learn about and it will immerse you into the game even more because you have a better understanding of how verything came to be. absolute must buy for any rpg fan and other gamers looking for hours of gameplay.",53.9

"started out as a prioner with no money about to be decapitated. proceeds to play many hours levelling my character and slaying dragons. gets caught stealing a sweet role. is now a prisoner with no money. improvement from the start of the game as head is not being removed. turns head to clock and realises should have been in school 2 weeks ago. proceeds to play another 10 hours. 10/10 would waste life again. bury me with my alduin statue.",95.9
"i think everyone knows it, but this game is awesome. worth its money!",327.3
"the games great but if u alt tab or ctl w the game glichtes and u cant play the u need to start it again and that whole quest u were doing have fun doing it again",36.4
"this game is great. it will keep you entertained for hours at a time. i would recommend anybody to purchase this game.",0.7
"every bit as good as it was prmoted as being, on top of that the user mods are easy to install, and the few bugs i found were easy to ignore 9.5/10",631.1
"crashes all the time  coding laggy movement with the mouse",55.4

"gets a little bit boring after few hours, but id give it 11/10 if you still hesitate... buy it! just do it. you can trust me on this one :)",274.7
"the adventures in elder scrolls v are as good as it gets. theyve done a truly remarkable job in making a beautiful world where you just want to see what lies around the next river bend or hilltop. skyrim has set the benchmark for graphic excellence in gaming. looking forward to see what they can do with this type of game when they add a more positive script to it!",47.3
"one of the best games ever made, that you can replay over and over, mostly because of the awesome mods. after 650 hours of play i still find places ive never been to, or quests i didnt even know existed.",772.0
"you can be cat and you can also steal clothes 10/10 would bang",379.9
"really fun game that ive put a lot of hours into. looks good without mods and even beter with them. im able to get decent framerates and good graphics with my amd a8 when i feel like playing on my media pc with a controller. when using big picture you can almost get away with only using the controller but the first menu still requires a mouse so that is a minor inconvienience.",255.2
"like all the other elder scrolls games with better graphics and a dumb plot.",215.7
"phenomenal game. breathtaking graphics, which can be modded to an uncanny level. combat that molds itself around your chosen play style, intriguing sidequests. main quest is a little short.",450.1
"i dont own the game but i can write a review. 10/10",3.9
"expansive world with so so many (sometimes repetetive) quests, but generally excellent gameplay, a brilliantly immersive world.",117.5
"this is a must have game for any gamer. immersive rpg elements and a compelling story keep this game running at all times. adding mods in is just icing on the cake and the game tailers itself to you!",94.2
"tes v: skyrim is an excellent game. whatever your rpg playstyle might be, you will get a tremendous amount of mileage out of it. it is an astoundingly content-rich game, with an enormous world, a giant cast of characters, and a deep, multi-faceted plot that will keep you involved for dozens, perhaps hundreds of hours. more, the game shows amazing attention to detail, and the visuals are wonderful; youll often find yourself stopping to admire the view, whether it be of snow-covered mountains, the northern lights on a quiet eve, or a waterfall cascading down to the rocks far below (try to resist the urge to jump your character off it--he or she will probably die!). if youve the slightest interest in rpgs, the money youll spend on skyrim will earn you an excellent return. i place the game in the top-five of all games released over the past two years.",256.8
"possibly the most well-developed and immersive role-playing game of all time. if i had to go to sovngarde and could take but one game with me, it would be skyrim.",544.9
"you can mod this game to make your character into a big-titted police girl. b-but its not like i would do anything like t-hat! baka! ;-; 10/10 would weaboo the  out of this game again",48.4
"love everything about this game. i have played this game across 2 formats (ps3 - pc) and have found pc to be the best as it loads faster and there are mods to get around glitches.",206.9
"one of the best games i have ever played. the best part of it is that you can be totally involved in the world around you.",889.9
"this game has so much potential; but i have to say that they lost me when they only supported an inferior platform like windows. if this is ever ported to linux/steamos, or even mac i will play it. until then i consider it a complete waste.... to all windows developers; if you havent been watching the market the future is linux in every way.... i suggest that you jump ship to linux development now while you can get in early. its not only going to happen... it already has, the peices are in motion. xbox doesnt make any money for ms; and playstation doesnt have the numbers... steam has almost double the active users of either of them. i vote with my wallet... i buy any good game that i see if it has native linux support.",30.5
"this quite possibly my favorite game of all time. so rich and and deep. more than 100 hours played.",283.6
"a good game where you can get lost exploring for hours and ignoring the main storyline. would recommend.",55.1
"bought it just for fun and thought i was gonna only play it for like an hour but i thought wrong i hae now played it for 25 hours and i still love it! really really really nice game and if you add some mods too it becomes the ultimate game! so i definetly gives it thumbs up!",61.9
"seriously one of the best games ever. there really isnt a single reason not to get it.",90.9
"okay game. i guess i could recommend it. definitely not popular anymore (as if it was popular when it first released.....) i would say its on par with warz. 7.5/10 too much rpg",66.4
"personaly my second favorite game i have ever played on pc very fun plus there is lots of quest mods to download after you finish the main questline.",62.5
"suggestion: play it on your pc. endless fun with all sorts of modding & its boundless possibilities.",102.5
"absolutely amazing, the graphics, the storyline, the gameplay, and the mods oh god the mods!!! skyrim is an absolute 10/10 game, you wont get tired of it, and if you do then you can always get a mod that fixes that. very interesting dlcs and easter eggs are funny as f***. 9 million npcs 9 voice actors. youll barely even notice. buy this game naow",36.7
"left my house at 8 am in the morning planning on getting some quests done, and then a dragon decided to come by. so i fought the dragon at my front door until 10 pm at night. another day in skyrim. when i entered my house again, i found a fox strolling around in the room, so i killed the fox and skinned it, thats when my adopted daughter came to me and told me that she made a new friend--the fox that i just killed. 10/10 my daughter will never love me again.",1110.7
"this is the best rpg i have ever played completed like five times on the xbox and thought i would try it here.trust me this has great stories great quests and the great mods so highly recomended enjoy",15.3
"come on, you kill dragons, aint that enough? the only bad aspect are the extremely slow horses, but you can get mods on the workshop so meh.",34.2
"the elder scrolls is definitely one of my absolute favorite game series of all time, and skyrim is a great addition to it. i bought this game pre-ordered for xbox 360 (11-11-11) and have continued to play it consistently for the almost 3 years its been out. having the game for pc only makes it better, with the incredible amount of mods available, and the ability to create your own. not much that can be said that the hundreds of others havent said. 10/10. 5 stars.",57.5
"one of the best role playing games so far. with several hours of gameplay quests, sweet graphics and environment. an open world rpg that will get you to a whole new level of gameplay and experience. the dawnguard dlc is quite good and fun to play which adds more than 10 hours of extra gameplay along with the additional side-quests and definitely with a replay value. while the dragonborn dlc is a must-have, with new weapons, enemies, dragon shouts, armors, and of course an excellent side-story quest taking place in solstheim.",287.9
"why are you reading this? get the god damn game now!!!!",153.5
"among the best open world games ive played so far. it provides many hours of exploration, combat and questing. this is one of those games that is finished. it is done. you buy it and you have a great game. plenty of patches have come out by now and polished it to bring you an epic adventure. its also one of those games where dlcs add content to an already great game instead of stripping the game and reselling the parts as dlc. so although you dont need dlc, for those wanting more skyrim its a great option. the modding community provides a lot of content for free as well. many gameplay elements can be altered to your wishes. its a time sink. be warned.",559.9
"good game it needs pacients but its a fun game and if you get bored you can install mods or type cheats :d 10/10",40.4
"the story is good, gameplay is fun, combat is fun. but, there are some annoying glichts, like npc wont show up if you proceed before the dialogues are finished, thus slow downt he game progress, and your followers are just dumb. there are many glichtes like walking bug too. overall 8/10",253.3
"great game, but the story line is kinda lame. im sorry, but morrowind an oblivion is still the best.",123.0
"its a game that has stuff. played as werewolf lizard man vampire that yells at things until they die. would recommend. pi / 5",115.5
"this is my 3rd playthrough (with the first 2 being on xbox 360). playing on pc has opened me up to a ton of free mod content. its unlikely most of my steam library will get much attention for quite a while.",18.0
"this game is a awesome love it so much cant get board of it",41.1
"sykrin is game wheere dragons are fighting the humans an elfes but then the warrer come and becoms a fight and dragon man wants to kill americaa but wareerer turns drragon itno dead. 9/10 if you like to fihgt dragens and love amereca 10/10 if yu like fredum 0/10 if you hate amarica and like isis",0.7
"amazing game and open world to explore. its an amazing value when you when comparing hours of game play per dollar. buy it now!",1439.5
"best rpg ever!!! but seriously, the story line is really good no mather what people say to try and make it sound typical but really its unique and immersive, with so much side quests that will keep you playing forever with an amazing modding community. the graphics are amazing even if you cant afford to run an enb for this huge open world game and you will never get bored with all the mods avaible.. an action packed rpg for anyone. it is the greatest addition to the elder scrolls series.",180.2
"awesome game with great graphics and the capability to play for hours with new paths always becoming avaliable to you. great mods for it as well!",21.0
"imho the best title in the whole series as of yet. if you liked any of the previous elder scrolls games, this is a must have! remember to install the unofficial bug fix patches to the vanilla game and all of the dlcs before starting to avoid any game breaking bugs. too bad they have left out the randomly generated terrain for the later titles in the series, including this one. i really liked that feature about the first two games; arena and daggerfall.",270.7
"destruction magic level increased - real life productivity decreased",79.3
"great for anyone looking for a game that can do it all. choose how you want to play without limitation. i for one enjoy games that allow you to sneak and get through many conflicts with a few well placed arrows. i was pleasantly surprised to realize that there are many sneaky passages and tricks to exploit. with a strong modding community this is a game that will run strong for a very long time.",56.4
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a game which is in many ways limitless because its a huge sandbox just waiting to be explored its gonna last you for weeks and with the steamworkshop mod support its gonna extend the gameplay and overall experience of the game. i highly recommend you buy it on sales because its too pricy i got it for 40$ and i wasnt complaining but you can get better offers!",187.0
"this is a game of endless gameplay which will pull you into its world and have you fully immersed in this light rpg adventure. i say light because this game is a little less complicated than other rpgs, theres no real stats other than health, stamina and magicka and it just feels a bit more casual. the base game itself is great but the potential for modding makes it a must-buy. dont like a certain aspect of the gameplay? youll find a mod for that. graphics too dull? theres 100s of enb mods and texture changes out there. want to fight thomas the tank engine? - yep. mods. i play as arnold schwarzenegger and i run around the land terminating random people and following my mission parameters. ive modded it so much that its barely even skyrim anymore, its more of a wilderness survival game with dragons and .",115.1
"too much to do in this game. i would definetly recommend this game to anybody looking for a great rpg game. there is so much to do in this game from joining factions to turning into a freaking werewolf! also this game is very cheap during the summer sale so pick it up now. also 11/10 killing a chicken makes the whole town mad.",51.3
"this game is just amazing. ive played it so much, but still not enough. not only is this game extremley immersive, it also has endless replayability. every single character will be different, i can guarentee you that. but for those days that you do get bored while playing the game, you can browse the workshop and websites for mods to inhance your skyrim expirience! i suggest to anyone that does not own this game to buy it right now.",852.3
"some say this game sucks, some say this game rocks, some say this game is the gift of god to humankind, but all we know is its name is skit. you can often see it in the stores, you can admire it but you cannot afford to talk to it. and when you are finally accepted in the hood, you will have a nice surprise: horny, good looking fake women. skyrim is one of the games you only think youve finished the story, but then an old f...ed up man comes near you with a new quest that will take ages to complete. so yes, if you want to lose your life in quests, buy this game. but on the other side, your life is already messed up so why not?",24.3
"amazing game! - great open world to explore - lots of things to collect - very immersive experience - great modding community 9/10",139.3
"dragons and stuff. good game. has mods and stuff, too. great game. buy it.",209.6
"skyrim is a top tier single player game that anyone who likes to play single should get. mods allow it to be very realistic and the entire gameplay is very time consuming, expect to play this for a year",14.0
"this game is fine if you have never played an elder scrolls game before, or have no care what so ever about the story and setting of nirn. otherwise it is a peice of excriment that does all it can to taint each and every part of one of the most unique settings ive seen in fantasy.",154.8
"this game is like a very voluptuous redhead woman across the table that caught your eye.. you know you want to play with her forever",140.3
"good game fun, doesnt take much to run it. and steam screwed me because it was 75% off right after i bought it for full price :(",38.2
"great game, worth the money. the modding community is great and gives you a great variety of ways to enhance the game.",167.0
"as an elder scrolls game? its bad. as a game in general, if you dont have mods? still pretty bad. as a game in general, if you do have mods? its okay. very casualized, but still fun if you get an overhaul and a couple of mods or 80.",345.7
"amazing game, great storyline, great free roam feel. although the new elder scrolls you made was a mistake. make a game like skyrim then your buisness should sky rocket again.",57.9
"best mmo i have played yet cant wait for the next!",82.4
"what an amazingly fun game to play. so much to do i never get bored. endless quests and enemies to face. im sorry, i l love killing dragons. thats why we cant have nice things.",126.6
"takes adventuring to a whole new level! with these stunning graphics you will feel as if you have stepped back in time or in a whole new world!",96.3
"normally i get tired of elder scrolls games fairly quick, but i keep going back to this one. love just dropping into skyrim and running around for a few hours.",39.0
"i highly recommend this game to someone who has 17 hours a day to spare every day",83.9
"while riding a horse i made it jump off of the highest point in the world and lived however...r.i.p. horse #1337 10/10",1096.5
"not my type of game, its a great game, but not my type.",39.1
"skyrim is amazing. so much customizability is at your fingertips,you can design your character in any way you want.",69.6
"the game is great but the they have it fixed that you have to go on line through steam to play. since steam is incompatable with my computer i have to download the game through steam every two times i play. at 6 hrs a download this is getting ridiculous. when you buy a game you should not have to go on line to play the game. this is crap. for this reason i do not recommend this game.",818.2
"skyrim is a well executed epic open world rpg with stunning graphics and great story. i would highly recommend this game as you can get tons of play time out of it. the only issues i had with the game were as follows. 1) like some of bethesdas other games, this one can; and i say can not will, have crashing issues with save files being corrupted. 2) the combat system while being robust, isnt as robust as it was in previous elder scrolls titles. however, you shouldnt let these two things deter you, the crashes dont happen to everyone, and the combat system is still great. plus, if you include all the dlc and the workshop mods, this game has nearly limitless content. well worth anyones time.",92.5
"if you havent played this game already then well...i feel sorry for you.",453.7
"this game is really scary. please dont play if you have any heart conditions without first seeking advice from your doctor.",24.7
"simply put, the best game ive ever played. cant get enough of it.",1116.0
"the game felt a litlle short and im not too happy about the sytem of magick and archery compared to oblivion but all around skyrim went beyond the expectaions of an elder scroll game.",914.5
"bethesda obviously wanted to make skyrim the more accessible game of the series, so they went and streamlined it. streamlining is good, to be sure, but they did an amateur butcher job and cut away some of the meat along with the fat. apart from your skills, there are no stats, when you level up you can put ten points into a resource bar of your choice and spend a perk point on a tree to beef it up a bit. have fun with that. while it also looks nicer than the other tes games, its all plastic surgery; a nice illusion placed over a missing heart. skyrim isnt written as oblivion or morrowind, the characters are less interesting, and so are the cities, unless youre just in it for the same old cliched fantasy designs. im not telling anybody anything new here; skyrim is an old game now and everybody knows whether they love it or they hate it, im just putting my two cents forward and hoping that tes vi be a more interesting game than its pedeccesor.",7.6
"this game is great if you like fantasy and killing dragons i love it for all the great mods and gameplay",14.7
"soooo great even after you have finished and maybe gotten bored just install some mods and restart your advernture!",64.4
"one of the best games i have ever played. 200 plus hours of fantasy fun.",170.6
"ultimate rpg. this game is just fantastic and with steam workshop support, it just keeps getting better and better. it may be aging, but it still sure is fun. this game is a thumbs up from me.",30.7
"as a gamer who grew up playing oblivion, skyrim is a dream come true. the main story isnt quite as good, and the cities arent as interesting, but the side quests and faction quests are heavily improved. plus, the combat system has been completely redone, and is much better than it was in oblivion. the mods for skyrim are pretty good, with several already famous ones. bethesda really outdid themselves with this game. however, as with most of bethesda titles, this game is fairly buggy on pc. i originally had it for xbox, but later purchased it on pc for mods and texture improvements. the game bugs out with steam in-game chat, and sometimes crashes. if you can look past this, the game is definitely worth it. 8/10.",158.4
"amazing! best game i have ever played i have it on my ps3 and pc now! bethesda you are amazing 1. for the elder scrolls and 2. and you made the fallout series. great job bethesda keep up the good work!",101.5
"359 hours says a lot especially considering thats hours where i didnt use rcrn you could probably quadrupple that or something. great game just dont break it by over modding, like i do.",358.8
"my friends say this is a great game. i wish i could find out. since i have no ui whatsoever no matter what i try to do, i cant actually play the game. pity.",1.9
"great game! this game is great! this game is alot of fun (so are mods) but yea btw if you know how to stop being a vampire plz plz tell me",56.2
"you can take this game to whole new levels on pc. its a must-have.",218.2
"it is skyrim, you like rpgs, you like open world games? this is a good one of those.",90.7
"ive spent more hours playing this, and other bethesda games, than i have playing any other game. the modding community is great, and despite a few minor issues, this may be one of the best games of all time. 10/10",627.3
"i never uninstall skyrim. i come back and play it over and over again because its amazing game with vast amounts of replayability. a huge world and if you ever get tired of what the game offers. the number of mods are countless. anyone can find a lot to like in this game.",372.2
"i recommend this game because it is a very exciting game with alot of weird and creepy things including ancient nord ruins, falmer, etc. but the main reason why i like it is because there is alot of roleplay and stuff to do, earn, and mess around with. its one of my favorites and ive had this game a while on my xbox. but with the whole moding experience id say it is pretty crazy and awesome! you should get it.",148.9
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazing, enticing open world with vast quanities of things to do. whether it be fighting off legendary dragons or delving deep into the ancient dwemer ruins, it is impossible to get bored. the music is exhilarating and triumphant, the gameplay is stupendous, the languages within the game are linguistically beautiful and you feel like the characters are one with your family. after indulging for hours on end playing this game, youll find your self-impowerment increasing and you will feel like the dovakhiin, or, dragonborn. the soul of a warrior... (i recomend playing at an adept or legendary game difficulty or the game will seem a bit slow) -enthusiastic",13.7
"macho man randy savage dragons. what else do you need?",168.3
"another addition to the elder scrolls, skyrim had my hopes up for a great sequel to the other games. having been fond of morrowind and oblivion, i had preordered skyrim the moment i could afford too. only to find out that skyrim is so graphic heavy that if your computer doesnt have top of the line hardware your going to run into issues. my radeon hd4800 cant handle skyrim and i crash to desktop almost religiously near any town, to the point that i am no longer playing skyrim because of the fustration. i recommend skyrim only if your computer can actually handle it. even the minimal requirements to run the game does not guarentee that it will actually work. ill return to playing skyrim once ive forked over a bit of money and time to upgrade my computer to at least decent standards.",127.2
"a very fun fps?, rpg. this game provides lots of things to do, explore, fight, and discover. you will find yourself captivated by this game for hours no matter what kind of games you are into. the only problem for me would be the slowness of the armor and weapon upgrades and all the real-time traveling",10.0
"havent even completed it yet. but with 96hrs into the game it is the best game of the year by far. i seriously recommend this if you enjoy fallout 3/ new vegas or the elder scrolls series.",150.6
"i personally love skyrim. i highly recommend it to people who love rpg games. 10/10",19.0
"you just cant go wrong with this game. i have over 190 hours of play time and there is still so much i have left to do. great graphics. great story. great game play. just a great game.",304.8
"must say, to be short, this is the dream of well rounded rpg open world awesomeness. if you have any desire to play a game till you fall asleep for weeks, this is the one. :)",334.2
"the elder scrolls v : skyrim is one of the best games i played in 2013, possibly the most immersive and addicting game ive played as far as i know right now. its been 3 years already and i still have more dungeons to delve, trolls to slash and bandits to shout off cliffs. i definitely reccomend this as a 10/10 game!",512.4
"this game is awesome.variational{my new word hehe}",141.3
"for a game that promised complete freedom to roam i was very disapointed how linear the story was. from unkillable npcs to huge disjuncts in certain stories. plenty of better rpgs out there.",15.2
"this is a game that you can play over and over. so many ways to make your character its own way.",50.7
"must be a never ending open world. i doubt ill ever find time enough to do it all. great graphics, and the story line is pretty damn good too. great game!",162.8
"great game, even better with mods. it has a good immersive factor.",61.8
"it is a good game. but you better think before doing a character, because doing more characters and playing all over again is just way too boring. anyway, the game is pretty good, but without a good pc graphics will not be as beautiful as the game. i rate 8/10. thanks, and have fun! ~gabe newell",251.4
"i love this game and i would recommend anyone who hasnt already to buy it and play it",40.3
"i have been playing this for 6 months now and still can not believe how vast this game is. its by far the most fun i have had on any computer game...not bored yet!",375.9
"if you are a fan and vivid player of bethesda games and or just the elder scrolls saga this is a wonderfull chapter in the saga and to the bethesde genre, its a must play with its open world fantasy along with that rpg element that only bethesda can give you.",75.2
"excellent game for when you want your own personal game time. plenty of quests for when you want to make progress on storylines. but just as enjoyable if you want to just chillax and explore. the latest patches go a long way but highly recommend the unofficial patches to fix some left over minor bugs. the workshop and nexus have excellent mods to customise the base game into a version you enjoy. if you found something annoying in the game, likely someone else did too and already created a mod for it.",510.7
"this game is straight out of 2011, but still holds up well to nowadays standards when keeping it vanilla. youre given a bunch of locations to explore, a bunch of quests to complete, a ton of bandits and animals to behead, and factions. whether you want to be bladesman, professional robber, or hitman. all yours to choose. the game starts off with a heavily scripted event, where youre about to get killed, but freed due to a dragons raid.  that- everyone knows that beaten path already. anyway, vanilla is good from the quantity of things to do. only thing that was painful for me was the skill grindfest. now to the amazing part. you can chunk a ton of mods onto this game and itll look better than recent releases, depending on how much your rig can handle. 2k textures? all there. 8k dragons? all good. a ton of enb shaders? even better cinematics than the one console players defend. though, workshop is poorly done. better grab only a few mods off there. best methods are nexus mod manager and mod organizer. if youre new to making games awesome, take it slow, or you might flip a table because you installed your ton of mods in the wrong order. now, go play the beaten path everyone knows,  up the dawnguard, and kill the emperor with your cooking skills, and dont forget to get yourself a good enb.",525.2
"this game is timeless. they rated this game 10|10 for a reason. its addicting and very detailed. i love it!",416.5
"skyrim is definitely, hands-down, one of the best games in recent years, maybe even in gaming history. the graphics (especially with mods installed and a little tweaks to the games engine) is surreal and beautiful. admittedly however, the main quest is not that interesting, except for the last one. what makes skyrim truly shine (along with its dlcs) are the numerous side quests present in the game. by actively seeking out quests and finishing them, players will get a healthy does of loot, and numerous tidbits of information. ive already poured more than 170 hours in this game, and it seems like the quests never end, and ive finished a lot due to my explorative and curious nature. the combat is essentially satisfactory in the vanilla version, but with mods, the combat becomes even better that it keeps you playing the game. i recommend the dance of death mod for those lovers of fights, and also enhanced blood textures, for those who love gore. all in all, skyrim truly captures the essence of a single-player rpg, with the graphics, numerous side quests, and the combat that keeps you going on.",304.4
"its just a great game, and with the mods and dlc its even better. the mods in this game is so high quality. i feel i should say more than this, but for now - just buy it and try it!",70.4
"this i say is one of the best games ever there is so much u can do ther are lots of bosses and its just amazing,this game is just the game that everybody has been waiting for!",9.4
"this game is amazing its alot better than the console version because you can get mods to make your experience better and thats what i like about skyrim i will recommend this game to all of my friends.",41.0
"i dont even know where to start this game is just so amazing the skill system is great there are so many skills plus class options of what class you want to be if you like the medievel ages dragons and classes skills smithing enchanting and so many others plus mods anything is possible in this game",333.3
"best modabel open world rpg ever. i spent hours playing and i havent seen it all (and i dont have any dlcs yet) so if you like to use mods its this game is awesome. for modding beginners, like i was, i can recommend the website skyrim nexus. they offer a mod manger which makes it easy to mod the game.",264.8
"i know this game is getting a little long in the tooth these days, but its a masterpiece. with the mods made by the community to upgrade the graphics sound gameplay, add extra missions (mostly all for free) this game could roll on for years without ever feeling dated. if you secretly harbour a passion for role playing games and dont want to harrased by the mmorpg player intent on ruining your day, then look no further! offline yes! better than any online game ... definitely!",211.6

"afer these few years i still find myself able to come back and replay this game, of course to get the most out of a replay it is always best for really any elder scrolls game to put on a few mods. this is were this game becomes even greater then when it was first released (besides that ui). with steam workshop even the most inexperienced modder can easily find and add mods to their game, and being a few years since the mod tools were released ther are a abundece of mods to chose from. if your conferable geting mods online, the most popular site tes nexus has over 30,000 different files to imporve almost all aspects of the game. i do highly recomend to everyone that does buy this game now, to go get two mods that will make your life a bit easier, skyrim script extender (skse) and skyui (avalible on the workshop) if you havent already bought and are still hesitent this game is always on sale during holiday sales so you could always wait untill the next one. (at the time of writting the next sale should be the spring sale)",175.2
"if youre looking for a great game with an extremely high replay value, even after having about 100+ hours, id reccommend this. i dont have many hours on record for steam but on the ps3 i have close to 200 hours on multiple accounts.",2.2
"skyrim is a wonderfully detailed world that provides hundreds of hours worth of play. even though the game is now three years old it is still one of the best, if not the best game of its type out there on the market. i paid sixty dollars for the game a month before it came out and i have more than gotten my moneys worth out of it. sadly, steam and valve has caused far too much difficulty for me. they take a ssimple disk download and turn it into a two week ordeal. they require that i prove that i bought this game eveb though i have bought dlcs that require this game from them. the service is laughable and at best unreliable. in short they make this game a waste of time. i will remind you that the only servie that steam provides is to the companies creating the software. they dont do anything for the actual customers who bought the games. i have supported bethesda with the purchase of elder scrolls 3,4 and 5. i also bought fallout 3 and new vegas but i refuse to ever buy another game from them as long as they continue to do business with the likes of steam. dont waste your money on this game. dont waste you money on anything that steam has any part of.",1246.6

"this is best game what i have ever seen. in this game you can do whatever you want",54.2
"amazing game. huge world to explore, and you can take pretty much any path... whether youre an assassin who kills everyone, a proud and noble warrior, a mage... theres no wrong way to play skyrim. and if you manage to get bored of the main game, theres endless content in dlcs and addons. of course, like any game, it is not exempt from bugs and errors, and the player physics can be finicky at times. however, this is still an outstanding game that everyone should try. 9/10.",253.8
"one of the best games ever created. seriously, buy the game.",16.7
"i can personally attest to the fact that skyrim deserves all the hype its gotten. one of my favorite aspects of the game is the fact that it isnt a mainstream, overly-colorful, slightly too fantasy-oriented rpg, that ends up being a bit cheesy. instead, skyrim has created a beautiful, yet rugged world in which anything is possible (especially with mods), and provides enough realism and strategy to be intense, while still being a fantastic, mythical experience that leaves you awe struck and nerd-gasming. play this game, i beg you.",442.5
"this game is so addicting but it is still fun. so many side quests as well as the main quest, so you never get bored.",51.6
"so, gabe... are you going to sell some real life now? i could use one... but after this last dragon!",79.0
"the fifth edition of the elder scrolls was a big hit and its just amazing compared to former games from bethesda. it does cost quite alot of money but its worth it. if you buy the game and need tips or any good mods, friend me on steam (zero) and ill help you to the best of my abillity. i personally recommend the elder scrolls:skyrim to anyone above 7 years of age.",363.4
"i havent logged much time on pc *yet* but i have been playing skyrim for over a year on playstation and, with the deal on at the moment, found it impossible not to buy and relive so many strong memories. whether you like vampires or werewolves, role-playing or house-building (with dlc) this is the game for you! the replayability factor in this game is insane. i have tried nearly every combination of spell and sword and shield and bow and two-handed weapon but it never gets boring! i was worried that i wouldnt like this game back when i previously bought it on ps3 as i am not a massive fan of medieval stuff but i was sorely mistaken. this is a must get game for... anyone really; just get it. 10/10 never-ending fun",11.5
"great game. one of the best rpgs that i have played.",21.1

"very good open-world game. the history, legends etc. are just so intersthink that i can`t understand how the hell did they made the history work so well at this game... there are some bugs at this game that are little bit annoying but they aren`t so big... can`t wait to see the next tes game...

"i do like the game but there are a few small bugs that you notice when you first start but as you play the game more you learn how to combat them but a bug that i have now discovered is that everything has dissapeard of the screen my compass,stamina,magica,health,subtitles and crosshairs along with the sneaking eye im not sure if it is a mod that is doing this but it works on a differant computer if anyone knows a fix for this i would like to hear it but other than that the game has been great the wolves falling out of the sky was a great thing as well (it was a bug that came with hearthfire after i had built my house) i would recommend if you have a mid end to high end pc otherwise it doesnt look that good nut is still a good game 7/10",186.0

"this game is practically never ending fun. if youve completed the main quest along with all sides quests you can downloaded player addons ranging from upgrading the already amazing game to even higher hd, evtra and new storylines, new weapons, the list goes on and on. this is a most definite buy. 10/10",31.2

"well, another review. this time its skyrim if you didnt notice. first off all. i loved this game when i had it on console. it was a good game to waste some time. i have put a lot of hours into this game and i still havent found every single thing in the game. there are also quite a few quests i havent done. went i got it on pc a couple of days ago. i discovered the wonderous world of mods. there are so many mods out there for this game. if you can think of a mod, somebody has probably already made it. anyway, there is too much stuff in this game for me to review in depth. (i like to keep my reviews short(ish)) if this game is on sale, you should pick it up.",66.2
"seriously? youre looking at reviews for skyrim? i suppose if you were asleep since 2012 you might not know that skyrim is a solid game and if youve never heard of an elder scrolls game you may not know thats its a massive open world rpg. much like oblivion, skyrim simplifies a lot of the rpg systems which surprisingly actually makes the game better on a whole. the real draw to skyrim right now is the plethora of steam workshop content available for free allowing you to mod the game to your hearts content. i have a 5 word recommendation if you choose to play skyrim and check out the workshop: macho man randy savage dragons.",130.2
"really worth spending my cash on. but only one word can describe this game, and that is amazing. i mean the graphics, the storyline, the fighting, its just breathtaking. definitly recommend buying this game when you have the chance!",11.3
"one of the best games i have ever played, 400+ on record. alot of replayability, and the modding comunity is great. the game really lets you play it your way. no matter if you want to be a healing elf, or a dragon slaying orc you will still enjoy this awesome game",384.7

"probably one of the best games ive ever played. even though it is a little old, it still is a great game. skyrim has a lot of things to do other than the main quest line. plus there are mods that adds even more content to the game. would game again 10/10",73.8
"best rpg game ever if you love medivel theme + fantasy plus you can mod the game :)",284.6
"a very deep and challenging adventure for certain.. only true gamers will appreciate. boosh!!",175.8
"alright so, i own this on xbox, ps3 & pc. i actually cant get enough of it. it gets a little old sometimes and ill stop playing for awhile maybe a month but trust me, i think i can safely say ive spent at least like 300 hours playing this game and havent even come close to clearing all the places, finishing all the quests or even finishing the main story <3 i do start new games often and swap from one consle to the next but my freaking god this is a game that ill probably still enjoy when im like 60 (: im also writing a fan fiction about some of the things you do in skyrim <3 i know lame isnt it? but still, this game will stand the test of time , cant wait for dawnguard ! 100/100",119.9

"a really well crafted game for those that like to play open-ended in a whole country. a host of mods can customize the game to make it whatever you want it to be. my only complaint is some mods, or combinations of mods, make it unstable.",653.8
"125 hours in, level 50+, not even near done. just too much fun. you can make this game be whatever you like, enjoy your own adventure. i will say that the game is a bit too easy really once you level up appropriately and it definitely gets redundant. the same monsters, the same attacks. need variation. didnt stop me from enjoying it. get it now if you havent.",127.5
"its elders scrolls what else do i really have to say all the elders scrolls games have been good, this game has good gameplay, nice graphics, and good story to top it off.",26.9
"this is a good game! it has many hours of playability, and pretty much is from one of the best rpg franchises in our time. while skyrim is a step back from previous earlier titles , such as arena, daggerfall, morrowind, it is still great fun. for the newer generation of elder scrolls games i would pick oblivion over this, but i still recommend any game from the best franchise ever created. i score it a 7 out of 10.",44.2
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"its skyrim. its an elder scrolls game (before they destroyed the name with eso *shudder*). if you like your role-play real and live wake up with a new story daily this is the game for you. the best part for me isnt the main story at all (although that is great) its just walking the land, experiencing new things all the time. i havent found half of what this game has in it, just because i spend most of my time wandering around, reacting to random encounters. :> this is a game you can stop playing for months, go back to, and pick right up again. and god knows i have...many, many times. buy it.",583.6
"played this game for so many hours on different consoles over and over... 5 stars",34.4
"to start i am a newbie to elder scrolls. i remember playing morrow wind on the xbox and it didnt appeal to me than. however jump a couple games down and i have to say ive missed out on a lot when i dont buy elder scrolls on the computer. ive put up a lot of hours and still havent beaten the main storyline. this game has a lot in it and its worth the money.",52.7

"this is game is probably the best rpg to hit us in the last decade and i have played it on all three platforms. first being of course my 360. but nothing compares to how beautiful this game looks on a pc, mainly a desktop being much more powerful than a laptop. anyways, if youre part of the 1% that hasnt played this game yet you really need to. youre missing out.",1.1

"its a great open world first person hack and slash. it is not a well designed rpg thus i cannot recommend it to someone who wants a good rpg (if one is even willing to call it an rpg). here is why: story and setting was weak. exploration was ok and quests held no consequence. items/equipment didnt make a difference in combat because the monsters leveled to you thus the player felt no character progression (aka beating a dragon at level one with your fist...) character actions and abilities, experience and levels, had no meaning or relevence (they striped magic and once again anything at level 80 you killed, you couldve killed at lvl 1 thus items/abilities are simply cosmetic... combat... well you just swing at  and it dies.",371.3

"the elder scrolls v is essentially the epitome of an rpg- immerive world, massive amounts of content, and story that intricately explains places that arent even that important in the big picture- this attention to detail is what makes this game quite possibly the best game i have ever played. the availibility and ease of installing mods makes it possible for even more immersion, or if you want to, lore-breaking fun. verdict- 10/10 with badass seal of approval.",869.0
"oh. my. god, if you like rpgs and you dont own this game, why? buy it! the graphics are beautiful (if you computer can handle it, if it cant do the graphics at the default, try turning them down in the launcher) the story is wonderful, the combat is really , though, fix that combat system next time bethesda. this game is my favorite game of all time and it will be forever in gamers hearts. 9.5/10, the only thing that held it back was the combat and the small amount of replayability. this is one of the only games i would consider buying dlc for.",647.6

"unlimited replay value, thousands of places to explore, customized items, and thats without any mods/expansions! the best thing about skyrim, is that you can be exploring an area and you simply have to stop and admire the scenery in the distance. its hard not to take screenshots every 10 seconds! 10/10.",104.3

"this game. this game. uh... this game is the by far the most f*@king amazing game i have ever had the pleasure of playing. i first played skyrim on my ps3 but it is 200 times better on pc thanks to the workshop and the guys over at nexus mods. if u like adventure, mmo games, exploration, and walking around like a true badass then this is your game. also on ps3 i played skyrim for over 141 hours so ya i know the game. plus its even more fun with the dlcs.

(on pc,its alot better.) -all the dlcs have good replay value,ive played through dawnguard about 4 to 5 times (including my console experience) -mods make a fantastic game even better -lots of enchantment options,armor,and weapons -a whole bunch of monsters,like giants,spiders,and trolls -10 diffrent races,each with its unique powers -has enough content to last over 100+ hours cons: -compared to the last elder scrolls games,this game has alot of handholding,like non-killable npcs -game is prone to alot of stupid crashes,and bugs now,this game has been mainstreamed compared to the previous games,but dont let that fool you.every fan of rpgs needs to get this game.if you dont have it,get it,because i can guarantee youll have a great time.i totally,100% recommend this awesome game.its the pinnacle of any rpg,and 1 game that every gamer,no matter pc or console,should have in their library.",161.7

"honestly one of the best games ive ever played. the open world experience gives amazing freedom to the player, unlike the more linear games. the style of the game is both dark and semi-cartoonistic which is a great combo, questionable but great. the vastness of what you can do is incredible. you dont rely on fixed classes, but pick and choose as you go. the leveling up process is unique as well, giving even more freedom to the player by choosing exactly what they want to make stronger. an amazing game overall mainly for its freedom to do as you please. totally reccomend it!",132.7

"if you havent already, buy this game!!! even at 15, skyrim is a masterpiece. the 3 dlc adds more hours to your over 100 hours of gameplay. plus modders never stop making content that improves the game further. this is what got me into rpg games. seriously, you have to buy this. its at a low price, but even better if you can pick it up during one of the steam sales. i cant express how great skyrim is. theres plenty of stuff to discover. just go and buy it already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",218.8

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best games i have ever had the pleasure of playing. in my opinion it easily keeps up with the other games in the series, and one thing that makes this game better is the fact that the combat system feels less constricting and the movement just feels a lot more realistic. skyrim has everything that oblivion lacked, like modern graphics, a better combat system and more balanced races and a better spell-system, but however lacks one of my favorite features from oblivion; creating your own spells, although it has a wider variety of spells for the different schools. the story line is simply great and after finishing (or before?) the main story line you still have hundreds of hours fun left in this game, which gives it 10/10 stars from me.",132.0

"this is my all time favorite game, (excluding minecraft,) but i love the way the npcs dont just say one thing over and over again, (unless you make them.) the graphics are amazing, and i just cant believe how much work was put into this game, but all in all, this game is epic!!!!",148.7

"probably the best open-world rpg out there. definitely one of my all-time favourite games. the replayability is superb and the modding community is highly active, which makes it easy to play the game the way you want to play it. for me the modding experience has been the greatest aspect of the game. you can easily make the game graphics look like up to date games (as long as you have a decent graphics card). the atmosphere in the game and the way the game feels alive is something that will keep amaze you throughout the game. it really feels like a living world, even though you will stumble upon bad or awkward npc movements and behaviour (but mods can help fix this). the music and voice acting is as good as it can get. if you like rpgs there are no reasons why you shouldnt own this game already. 10/10.",80.1

"one of the things i look for in games is replay value - skyrim is no slouch in that department. the amount of content in this game is incredible - ive been playing this since it first released in 2011 and im still discovering quests and locations ive never found before. a single playthrough can easily log in excess of 100 hours, over 200 in some cases depending on your playstyle. it may not be the perfect game, but the ability to customise it with mods allows the community to shape the game: fix bugs, add new content, overall increasing the lifespan and enjoyment of the game. would i recommend this? any day of the week, without a doubt.",310.2
"awesome game, extremely replayable, supports tons of different play style, one of the best.",496.6
"as most people may have noticed this game is one of the best games of all time. they should have called it skyrim simulator. cause games are mostly battleing the game mechanics to gain more points or getting higher score. wehre as this game is just an experience and what ever you do in this game you are rewarded (except jumping all the time). but with that comes a seperation in peoples intrest. some hate and some love it. the non hard core gamers love this game because you can play it slow and just take in the experience. but the hardcore gamer will wiz throught the game finishing the main quest and call it done because he is looking for challenge. but the side quests of this game are even better than the main quests. you try to explore a little cave and a story unfolds like no other and is related to five other side quests. that is awesome.",183.1

"your kids kids will be playing this game or another version. the only thing to stop this game is the company itsself. i would rank this game series up there with civ5. i will say sims and sim city series also. when you come across a good game it just stays with you. this game is wide open. never are you made to go to point and and talk to ted and go kill 10 of this and pick 10 of this plant. you have a main quest then you have a civil war and then you have a wide open world with people to help and deep dark dungeons forts castles and numerous other places to explore. with the hearthfire add on you can even build your own house and adopt children if thats what you want to do. go slay a dragon and come home and have dinner with the wife and kids. that is unmodded skyrim. go on the workshop or nexus and you can spend days looking at mods to do just about anything you want to do. the elder scrolls modding world is one of the most open and friendly mod communites you will ever find. if you want a fantasy rpg where you decide where to go or what to do then this is the game for you. i hope you enjoy it just as much as i have and still do.",766.8

(did they even play their own game?!) and of course they have yet to fix them ... i think they never will.the game gives you freedom on the sole purpose to hide the fact that has no story to tell except maybe 4 quest lines (~2 hours worth of gameplay).now that the price has dropped (or even better if you find in on special offers ) i would recommend it as a good way yo kill your time but nothing more .",112.0

"stunning graphics and awesome story. truly the god of rpgs",66.4
"i have put many hours into bethesdas latest elder scrolls game and i can confidently say its great! explore the vast wilderness of the nordic homeland or relax in one of the many populated holds the game offers. complete quests in a variety of ways resulting in great value, just create another character (yes you have to play through the same helgen part over and over again) and set forth on your quest... the amount of choice in the game is spectacular for open world rpg lovers, change your characters eyebrows and ears to degrees of precision that i never thought possible. many of the larger questlines have a set path for you to follow with smaller choices along the way whilst side quests let you choose (usually from 2 options) which path to take. mods are a great way to keep things interesting, not only can you change the game in ways that give it a whole new feel, but you can just tweak things like textures or weapon appearance. for a relatively small amount you can add in solstheim or fort dawnguard to your world and enjoy the new threats and adventures the world holds, or give up your dragon fighting ways, hang up your daedric armour and start a family, giving skyrim a new generation of dragonborn (if it is genetic)",85.3
"great mods, huge map, midieval age like gta, tones of submissions, freely messing around, pick pockets, break into npcs house, kill the city guards, non-essential npcs being killed and their house is become to you. sh*t! this must be the best game i had ever played.",180.6

"i feel conflicted about this game. it is fun for a good 50-70 hours, but after that time you start to realise how much of the game is copypasted or just bland dull. once you get over that big hump of gameplay and start to see the game is wide as an ocean, but deep as a puddle with nothing you do effecting really...anything. if you want to play a elder scrolls game, play morrowind. if graphics are an issue for you, play with mge. so its a fun game for ~50 hours, but after that, it isnt. so... ill reccommend the game, but advise that you play morrowind after.",120.1

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"this is an awesome game, needless to say. however it does not achieve a standard i think tes games had already established. ive played tes since morrowind, and remember how difficult and rewarding the experience was. oblivion was less difficult but still quite rewarding. while skyrim provides hours of immersive gameplay, its also clearly geared towards appealing to a mass audience. this means easier quests and challenges. decreasing or increasing difficulty doesnt seem to make more than a superficial change in difficulty. personally, i think the introduction of fast travel and map markers make this game hold your hand to ensure you dont become disenfranchised by too much of a challenge. in morrowind you had to accept the fact that its difficult in the beginning, but it makes the experience exponentially more rewarding once you get good. skyrim is still a fun game, and the landscape is quite beautiful. its an achievement in the aesthetic department. just not difficulty. id recommend playing dark souls if you want to play a fantasy rpg with some degree of difficulty.",84.9

"the elder scrolls skyrim is a strong single-player only classic rpg. it features a skill-based system and an open world. this game has tons of content and a decent story. some of the side quest writing is exceptional. the game also features dragons that fly around and can attack you at any time. these dragons dont really provide a challenege (especially towards the end game) but add to the world immersion. overall the game suffers from being way too easy. any experienced rpg player will fly through this game with little effort. its still worth a play through and still tons of fun but id go somewhere else for a challenege. never played the dlc. genre lovers: must buy (doesnt get anymore rpg than this) non-genre lovers: worth a try (tons of value and pretty easy) time to beat: ~80 hours (i did every side quest in the vanilla game)",87.8

"the fifth game in the elder scrolls series, its an enjoyable and fun romp through the province of skyrim. its already been out for two years, but since i have put so much time into it, i thought i would leave a quick review. the positives are: a large game world with free form play, crafting systems that let you make your own weapons, armour and potions, several enjoyable quests and most importantly bethesda support for modding. on the other hand, negatives are a roleplaying system thats been streamlined over the previous games in the series, too much hand holding, poor writing, an unimaginative main quest with a weak villain, characters that lack depth (directly related to the often poor writing), a game world that is largely static and doesnt really respond to your actions outside of specific scripted events and an engine that is showing its age and limitations.",1151.1

"this is a very fun game. there is an in debth story line, many quests, choices that change your future, one of my new favorite games. if it werent for the m rating, i am sure many more people wolud play it. i use a blood removal mod, so it brings it down to a t rating, one that me and my younger siblings can play. great game, 8.5/10",76.6

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim blew my mind when i played it for the first time. the world is massive, the water is prestine, and there is life everywhere you turn. wether it be a mushroom, a flower, or a magestic deer walking through the forest, the world feels alive and vibrant. there are so many things to do in this game it can be sometimes hard to chose what you want to try first. the crafting is fantastic - you can make your own armor, weapons, potions, or cook your own food... all using materials you collect throughout the world. creatures, monsters, and npcs are found in every environment, and nearly everything can be killed (except the children.. they cannot die... no matter how many times you whack them with a hammer...) you carve your own gameplay experience based on how you chose to play the game.. whether you become a blood sucking vampire and have to lurk about in the night, or if you become a werewolf prowling under the moonlight. the game constantly changes depending on the desicions you make, and that is very cool. also, there are dragons. who doesnt love dragons?",112.4
"this game has alot of content in it. ive never liked rpg, but this one geez its epic!",203.2
"a worthy successor of the elder scrolls series! if you have played and enjoyed oblivion, then you know exactly what youre getting into. i could easily call it more of the same, but refined and improved upon in many areas and easily become the massive time sink that oblivion was. if you havent played oblivion, pick up oblivion as its old and cheap now. sink a dozen hours or so and let that make up your mind. skyrim is a open-world fantasy rpg with a use-based skill system built upon bethesdas new creation engine and a improved radiant a.i. for the npcs. play as a warrior, thief, mage or any combination depending on your play style. and why pick the pc version over any of the others? one word: mods. a dedicated fanbase of modders changed oblivion with small changes to the ui or better textures and animations to gigantic changes with complete overhauls of the mechanics and gameplay or adding in new quests and quest lines. and it will only make skyrim richer as time goes on.",28.5

"accessibility: crap. interface: crap. player progression and difficulty control: crap. usability: crap. balancing: crap. yet average rating of 90+ anywhere you look. why? because this game is pure rpg madness. especially recommended if you are capable of letting your mind shape the world. this game offers your all the audiovisual stimuli needed to do so. if you want a more slow paced rpg with choices, cutscenes and cinematic presentation dragon age is the way to go. skyrim is for the free roaming rpg adventurer type.",307.1

"my review: one of thee greatest video games in the history of gaming. period. seriously though, this game has set the one of the highest standards (along side fallout 3) for an open world, rpg, action/adventure game. this games greatness lies in its vast open world space, exploration, lore, and unlimited replayability with the addition of...wait for it, mods! yes! mod support for this game is one of the largest communities in the realm of pc gaming. the game is essentially limitless with the amount of new high quality content that has been, and still is, being created 3 years after the games release. it is clear the skyrim modding community has not decreased their pace, and if anything, have only gotten bigger and better. skyrim has left a legendary mark in video games which modders will continue support into the years to come.",447.1

"years have passed since gamers have been permitted in the snow covered land of skyrim. if you have not picked up this game, i recommend you do. dragons, open world, compelling quests and playing it the way you want are all exciting reasons to get this game. the game doesnt penalize the player from playing the way you want to play. no classes, in the traditional rpg to speak of. instead this game rewards you for using skills. this means, you level up by doing what you like to do. if you use bow and arrow as your main weapon, your archery skill will increase and this will bump up your progress to the next character level. each new level grants the player a new perk, something that will give any player a boost. why this crazy monkey with a controller mentions this aspect of the game you ask? instead of concentrating on completing a series of quests or tearing through horde of evil mobs to level up, you just do what you want from the list of skills available to the player. most of my time was spent hunting animals out in the world. instead of the game making me feel like my time was wasted doing such activity, it let me play and made the wood elf (race of choice) into a deadly marksmen.",57.1

"omg! you buy this game now, yes!? you buy it now, yes!? you buy it! no, but seriusly... take my word for it and buy this game! thats all im going say... oh, and i give it a freakin 9/10 for the original game. original as in not modded, as in the game that actually comes from the box or steam or whatever, ya know. who plays skyrim without mods nowadays anyways? aaaaaaaaannnnd... *drumrolls* a 10/10 for the ability to mod this game like theres no tomorrow! i bet you did not see that one coming. :d buy this game, else im going to find you and punch you in the throat! just buy this game, thnx. :)",412.0

"bought this game years after its release yet this is already a classic that will survive time, with a neverending set of mods to improve quality at this pace this game may have decent modern graphics for a the next decade. for the price steam sales have been making this huge game is a steal. this game will keep you hooked for days, weeks, months exploring the gorgeous landscapes of the huge world full of little secrets here and there. the only negative point is that you may not have time for your own life, seriously play it during some holidays or something because this game may absorb you.",70.7
"this game has so many wonderful things going for it! its so immersive. its got literally hundreds of side missions. the main storyline is very extensive and engaging alone. and the adaptability of the combat system is amazing. the game literally builds your skills based on what spells, weapons, and armor types youre using as youre using them. unfortunately, as is common with bethesdas open-world games, the gigantic landscape is rife with glitches, exploits, and bugs. being able to bunny-hop up a sheer cliff or falling straight through the landscape and free-falling for eternity arent exactly conducive to realism... but even with these issues, this game is one you cannot pass up!",252.9
"this game is simply amazing! havent played much but i love the freedom available and complexity to the open world. a must have!",5.9
"legendy edition (with all the dlc) is (overall) the best fantasy rpg of all time, and i _love_ fantasy rpgs. the dlc really adds a lot of high-quality content. best played when you have all of the content at the beginning and the whole world just melts together with the dlc and you dont really know what is coming from where.",75.0

"this game is epic, it has evrey playstyle. craft potions and poisons,craft a weapon and enchant it to youre liking, this game was worthy of 400+ hours i have spent, the work shop adds to its delight,weapon mods,quest mods, house mods,and evrey other mod you can think of,even a goat simulator mod. i still play this game after almost a year. i love skyrim.this is a masterpiece. i know this review is possibly way overdue,but its my first.",624.5

"just a really bad rpg,  story,  characters, dull combat and one of the worst worlds ever nothing really fantasy based, even the dragons are  pros - a lot to do - bows are cool to use - nice crafting - mods cons - combat, wait then attack crap - the world is just hills and trees nothing really interesting - story, dragons are coming back...... they are zombie dragons -_- - characters, cardbored cut outs - not epic in any way - super easy, like omg if you want a good tes game, play morrowind if you want a good rpg , play dark souls",3.6
"do i have to really say anything anything? its skyrim (mods!)",251.2
"finally killed braith with the help of mods. 11/10 would buy again. but seriously, this game is one of the most immersive games to date. i have lost about four hundred hours to this game, as i first owned this game on the xbox 360. but i had so much fun with it, that i decided to buy it again on pc. not just because the pc version has mods, but because this game is genuinely fun. it was worth every dollar i spent on it.",237.2

"tesv skyrim is the best open world rpg in gaming to date. the amount of freedom and openness is stunning, and the game is truly stunning if you have a graphics card capable of handling it. the mod community for this game is among the most active thorughout gaming, in spite of skyrims age. mods are constantly being released and updated, allowing for nearly endless replayability. the main storyline is very good, but the sheer amount of dungeons and side quest will almost always attract your attention. you will likely spend hours traversing the wilds while dungeon crawling and hunting for loot. v very few of the side quests feel like fetch quests. each side quest has a uniqeness and fun all on its own. in addition to the main story and side missions, there are several unique factions that demand your services, each with its own fully fleshed storyline, characters, and perks. in conclusion, the world, errr skyrim is your oyster filled to the brim with hundreds of hours of story, loot, and fun.",24.0
"wether you played previous elder scrolls games or not, this will suck you in and wont let you go. if the main quest doesnt bring you all the entertainment you need, the near endless side quests will take up all your time. and having access to almost any kind of mod that you need will enhance the gameplay more than you can imagine. its not a game for everyone, but at least give it a shot.",193.6
"amazing game with days or replayability, simply wonderful.",95.4
"there is a reason people are still talking about this game, even though theres nothing left unsaid. easily one of the greatest rpg classics ever made. bethesda took everything that was right with oblivion, streamlined, mainstreamed it, and created the phenomenon that is skyrim. its worth any price, but comes on sale often. do yourself a favor and play it.",64.1

"its the elder scrolls. why wouldnt you buy this game?",41.5
"it has been a 2 year journey, i am now ready to take my place among those who have rated this title. skyrim can not be explained in mere words, it must be experienced for its beauty and unique saga. this game has many quests, stories, characters and even invisible dynamics. its excellence in a way reminds me of a great love, in the sense that this stunning vision also has its own flaws. do not misunderstand, skyrims flaws only add character and depth. in a world this vast there is always need for the angle of unknown. it cannot be better than oblivion or morrowwind, however those titles cannot surpase skyrim. its scenary will captivate and the many side storys and people you will engage have a life and story to (virtually) live through. armor sets are many and with great variety. i guess my favorite moments were when i would stand out at night.....just looking at the northern lights (aurora borealis). steam states that i am close to 145 hours, its much more than that trust me. in a nutshell if this game interests you even a little then play, a connection will be made nay even a bond that you will carry....forever.",145.5

"this game never gets old because of mods it looks like a modern game still yet it is over 2 years old and if you think the games leveling system got boaring there are a few mods that totally change that.",64.7
"a beautiful open world to explore freely, completely moddable, role playing game that excels at what it inded to. hundreds of npc with distinct related quest lines give a player tons of directed things to do in addition to simply exploration. its flaws are simply the restrictions of some of the quest lines and lack of flexibility found within them. there are still some bugs within the game, and likely will remain as time goes on, and the combat themselves arent as fluid as say the arpg style of kingdoms of amalur : reckoning but they are good none-the-less. this is definitely a title worth trying out, especially if you can pick it up at a steam discount!",343.8
"this is a very beautiful amazing game that all rpg fans should enjoy and cherish. you are the dragonborn, the legendary hero of tamriel. the dragon slayer. you are free to explore the beautiful open world of skyrim, fight trolls, bandits, or become a vampire, werewolf,thief, mage, warrior, or hunter. the choice is up to you.but oblivion is better. there are many mods you can get from the workshop,or use console commands to get stuff.:) but id recommend getting this game when steam has there wonderful summer and winter sales. i paid 10 dollars when it went on sale for 4. overall, amazing game. we need more like it. 10 out of 10",13.8

"i must say, this is the worst of all the tes made so far. tons of bugs, unfinished contents, easy as hell and with the worst linear story ever made, the unfriendlier inventory ui and tons of other things that screams to be changed. fortunately the modding community did a great job over the years and made the worst tes into one of the finest and best modded tes so far. with mods this game can become a great experience and i do reccomend it.",251.2
"skyrim is pretty amazing, but if you have a slow computer the experience is ruined. its a great game though, especially if youre into fantasy stuff.",4.1
"i am not sure why i am posting a review. besides the bugs, this is an awesome game! for example, i went to a tavern and came upon a guy who challenged me to a drinking contest. apparently, i got so drunk that i travelled all the way to the other side of the country, defiled a temple, and was forced to pick up after myself (but not before getting caught stealing from said temple and being charged with a quest to bring their ward). i step outside and i am immediately attacked by a dragon. such is the life in skyrim.",716.4

"one second i am looking a crazy person living in the sewers for the main story, next i am master of the thieves guild",682.9
"a great rpg experience. improves heavily on the mechanics of oblivion. skyrim provides hundreds of hours of gameplay and builds apon its predeceer (tes:oblivion) graphical fidelity is sadly not the greatest in skyrim but mods and enbs are available to add to the experience. but the game makes up for this with lush landscapes and mightly mountians to explore. the environments range from snowy mountians to the sunny town of riverrun to the towering capital solitudes blue palace. outdoors environments help build the epic atmosphere of skyrim with wildlife and bandits. but best of all. dragons. fighting dragons is the pinnacle experience of the game as they approach from the sky you will have to use shouts. as the dragonborn, you can use these shouts to cast a dragon from the sky to the ground, breath fire and even freeze time. as the dragonborn your primary quest will be to save the world from the almighty dragon alduin. but not just that, you can pursuit many more quests, you can just the dark brotherhood, become a mage, join the companions and even become a bard! skyrim is a world so engrossing that its flaws are more than made up for with its impressive open world, immersive character development and amount of incredible content. i recommend this game to everyone, skyrim truly is an epic experience!",278.1

"stepping into skyrims world is like wrapping yourself in a furry, nordic cloak that smells like your childhood blanket. yes, the oblivion you remember fondly is back  everything that made the last elder scrolls so lovable has returned. yet now its a bit wilder, a bit rougher, and a bit more dangerous, and boy is the game better for it. whereas cyrodiil, the province from oblivion, was a fairly typical temperate climate with deciduous forests and gentle rolling hills, skyrim is a bitter, cold northern region (remember those impassable mountains in the north of cyrodiil? skyrim is just beyond them). this doesnt mean the game world is a monotonous frozen waste: the land is diverse, but it has a wonderful tone to it that is very much viking axe clanking and visible frosty breaths huddled around crackling fires. its forbidding, slightly bleak, and yet also incredibly cozy when you come in from the cold.",41.0

"this continuation of the elder scrolls game series is undoubtably the finest and isnt likely going to be ever serpassed. the possibilities within the game are practically limtless, even without the use of mods or commands. this game is the most welcoming to its series and its genre of either rpg or fps. being easy for noobs to play or even self proclaimed proffesionals. if there was a number rating system, i would give it a 10/10",362.8

"skyrim is one of those games that have a very poor storyline the truth is that it takes only about an hours to finish skyrim main storyline. and if you play for good storyline dont buy skyrim get a different game. skyrim is that kind of game where every dungeon will look the same each side quest will be generic and similar, however what makes skyrim a game i will recommend to others is the ability to do what you want as a player. skyrim allows you to freeroam in a huge open world, as well as ability to mod the game. modding this game is what it means to play skyrim download 30+ mods and explore endless possibilities. if you like to mess around with games and you wouldnt mind to spend few minutes to understand how to add mods to your game then pick skyrim because i could play this game for days with no sleep as long as i find a good pack of mods. however without the mods this game can only keep one interested for 10hours or so.",231.6

"like skyrim with skyrim - ign, probably.. seriously though, this game is brilliant. yes there are bugs galore, but its a bethesda game, what do you expect? it still doesnt detract from the wonderous experience of procrastination you get from playing this game. worth the money at full price, but catch the dlcs on sale, as they really arent.",99.5
"best game of all time if you ask me, and many other people would agree. sandbox rpg. even though it was releaseed 2011, now, 2015 it is still the game you should play. everyone should play this game. look into gems and enb for greatly increased player experience, and use nmm. google it. it is worth it.",283.6
"in all honesty, i played this game in a short period of time, i do like the storyline so far. but, geez. only 15 picklocks? at the beggining. im so bad a picking a lock in general. im basically stuck at that part now. wanting more picklocks. but opps, silly me. oh well, i like the storyline. but the graphics make the video game so laggy and stuff, which frusterates me so much! i do recommend this game, if you have an actual good hardwired computer.",1.2

"on the record i got the elder scrolls skyrim in the anthology pack thats why its on my pc most of my hours are on the console . as much as i loved the elder scrolls series this game just felt like it lost the true felling of the elder scrolls and was a victim of the hype ,most people will disagree with me because they started with skyrim and didnt experience the others but skyrim is more of a action game than an rpg, most of the main rpg components have been dumbed down for more casual gamers,nothing against people who dont have hours to play a game and will like to jump in and out at a moment,true elder scrolls fans enjoy the rpg managing of skills and attributes but skyrim just doesnt have that.without the class system you can jump from a warrior to a mage and be oped in 30 mins it eliminates the fun of starting over and experiencing the game in a different way.personally morrowind was the best elder scrolls game because it was a true rpg some people think its nostalgia but i am 18 and still agree that it is because it works for what it is. i personally do not recommend skyrim but if you enjoy action game with slight rpg elements buy it but dont expect a true elder scrolls rpg.i played through it once and enjoyed certain parts but it just got so repetitive without the quest design from morrowind and the wacky characters of oblivion.",11.0

"341 hours is beyond the maximum amount of gameplay you are suppose to have for this game. it bugged out on many of the quests, so i was never able to complete every mini-quest in the game. i bought this game a months before the price was perma halved, and then discounted. i could have bought it for 15 dollars.",364.8
"anyone who likes rpgs should have skyrim. a lot of people will say oblivion was better, and in a lot of ways it was, but with the steam workshop and the nexus at your fingertips, skyrim easily becomes one of the funnest and most immersive rpgs out there. vanilla skyrim is fine, but the mods make it what it is. definitely recommend it.",98.6
"im writing this review for anyone who actually needs to read a review for skyrim. because you know, there arent any out there already. gaem iz gud, buy if u hev 2 pley of lyne (the game is wonderful, you should really buy it because it has a great modding community and the game itself is fantastic, with a long story line that you dont have to follow and an open world where you can kill (almost (important npcs)) anyone. this game is a must have because ts great for offline play and when youre online. the game is beautiful... uhh mods, mods, and mods, can make the game pretty much anything. for example the thomas the tank engine mod turns all the dragons into trains. idk why. but its there.) story: 10/10 gameplay: 10/10 presentation: 9/10 (-1 point for bugs, errors, glitches etc. they are common enough) soundtrack: 10/10 (epic) replayability: 10/10 (the mods)",80.5

"keeps you occupied for hours and hours on end. beautifully designed, too.",83.7
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",105.0
"great game especially with the current 19279 mods out there not including nexus espically since you can create your own mods using the creation kit. in the massive map u can run around skyrim and do anything u want and discover eastereggs hiden around the world and there are only 1 game i can think of that rivels this fallout new vegas and 1 game better elderscrols online witch is comming out soon and hopefully on steam with i belive new gaming tecnolgy the megaserver where u literly play with everyone online eveytime you prees play but geting beside the point it dose say that i played curently 22 hours but i have played the xbox version and done alot also i dont think anyone can actuly beat this game have the best armour and do everything there is to do yea buy it or wait for the elderscrolls online depending if u like singleplayer or multiplayer gmes p.s. if u like this game i recomend fallout 3 and fallout newvegas very similar games and the mod creation its except fallout is after a nuclear war wich i think is supposed to be the cold war and has guns but if you have windows 8 dot get fallout 3",39.7

"a good game with a lot of things to do. the main storyline is a bit lacking and the sidequests dont always stay interesting although there are more than enough to keep you playing the game for hours. you will het hours of enjoyment out of this title if you enjoy the world it puts you in but the repetitive combal and inconsistent stories may drive you away from the game as it did for me after a while. dont get me wrong, i loved the game while i was playing it but i did eventually get bored of it because of the many flaws it has.",121.7
"finally got around to purchasing skyrim: make sure you have lots of free time, this game will suck you in!",135.5
"skyrim is an open-world rpg with many, many hours of content. you start out picking your race. do i want to be a khajiit, and roam skyrim as a thief and/or assassin, or do i want to be a nord, running up to enemies and crushing their skulls in with swords and axes? there are over 10 different races to choose from, and each have their strength and weaknesses. there are hundreds of quests that are available to the player. hundreds of caves, dungeons, and castles dot the landscape of skyrim. there are various groups to join, each one focusing on different skills. the college of winterhold, a magic-focused group of people. the dark brotherhood, bloodthirsty assassins who kill their targets and claim their rewards. the thieves guild, a handpicked-few who excel in the art of sneaking, pickpocketing, and stealing things from other people. last, but not least, the companions, a few of some of the finest warriors in skyrim, who fight and live for glory. battle dragons, skeletons, trolls, and many other beasts, all while making a bit of coin and arming yourself with deadly enchantments, armor, or weaponry.",130.9
"i bought this game when it first came out and i still love it. its well designed and amazingly fun to play without any strategy guides, making finding the secrets challenging but far from impossible if you look closely. one of my all time favourites.",128.5

"skyrim is such a good rpg. i have played bugger all on pc (got it for the mods), but on console i must have clocked atleast 900 hours. youre a dovahkiin. you have magical powers related to your voice and like hitler, shout very loud indeed. theres a ton of weapons, armour and locations. aswell as bonuses related to your start race (khajiits see in the dark, argonians have histkin and orcs have big ) during the game you go and see the magical greybeards in order to continue your quest, these old codgers teach you the words of power in exchange for raunchy sexual favours. theres a system of random encounters in the game which i believe makes it seem more realistic. you can be attacked at any moment by enemies ranging from massive dragons, assassins, giant spiders or roaming orc rapists.",39.0

"this has some entertainment value but overall this game is lacking direction. its open world exploration is uninspired at best and brutally boring at worst. what story? where? if you want dark fantasy at its best go play the witcher and the witcher 2 where combat is skill based and story is exceptional. if you want hours of xp grinds and repetitive dungeons with no meaningful central story to keep your interest then this is the game for you.",66.2

"you cant marry ralof, this game sucks. b^( im kidding, of course (eventhoughireallywishyoucouldmarryralofcoughcough) anyway... as an open-world rpg, it is pretty damn fun. theres lots to do, and the story is interesting. being an open-world game, there are quite a few remaining bugs....that bethesda will not fix. theyre done with it; they dont plan on doing anything else with skyrim [sad trombone]. you get to choose a race, thats really cool. character customization, thats a plus too (at least for me). i mean, despite its flaws, this game is really fun and cool. if you have the coin (huehue), get it. i really reccomend it. also if you take the effort to learn the dragon language, i have a high respect for you and would probably smooch ya. (i mean its one thing to learn a real language but to learn a fictional language? hell yeah, thats tight as frick, yo b^] )",366.4

"the hype is real...you almost have too much to do in this game.",217.1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim; as a new player, i envy your privilege to experience this game as a new. immediately you are placed into the vast ruthless expanse of skyrim, located at the far north of tamriel, skyrim is a country occupied by an old-world society with in-depth political opinions and standings. each npc is convincing in terms of realism and pragmatism and thus the game achieves immersion. the world is unchained and wild, filled with dangers, wonders and a beautiful northern environment. in terms of mechanics skyrim lacks noticeable flaws; the combat system is satisfying and grants the player a sense of overwhelming power once it comes to battle; the soundtrack aiding the effect greatly. composed by jeremy soule and appending to the atmosphere. freedom of the player remains uncompromised, allowing you to approach the game as you please and providing an individualistically adapted experience to each. the narrative is acceptable with a clear equilibrium, disequilibrium and re-equilibrium. a direct link the to the fantasy world is present and it doesnt fail to provide the expected codes and conventions which are demanded by the customer. overall i would recommend this product to any individual.",64.5

"one of the best immersive rpgs ive played. although too many mods can ruin some things. also would love skyrim with 2-6 player co-op.",5.8
"elder scrolls have always been some of the greatest open world rpgs created. this time around you head far north into the mountains and the region of skyrim. there are a lot of blurred lines and you have to decide which factions you are wanting to join as some of them can be at war with each other. the guilds arnt as shiny and easy to recognise as they were in oblivion. skyrim has its equivalents each with their own storyline. the dark brotherhood for example isnt quirky like in oblivion, its just plain evil and you do get a tie in to oblivion and the events of the guild in that game. grab skyrim, most the major bugs have now been fixed and bethesda have upped the ram usage to 4gb. this is bethesda on top form.",83.3
"one of my favourite games ever! i love it. i played it and finished it on console but so much better on pc with all the mods. im going to start a new character i feel like a change of race is in order! lol",113.9

"this game is my absolute favorite. especially on pc. the loading pages are really fast and the game runs great on medium quality (at least on my pc). the game is detailed, addictive, and a lot of fun.",80.9
"pretty damn good game, play through once though and havent pick it up again.",50.3
"does this game really need any introduction? the elder scrolls: skyrim is a beautiful game with a rich story, excellent characters and a huge dynamic open world for you to explore. if you havent played through this at least once, you are seriously missing out. my only major issue is this is clearly a game designed for consoles without pc in mind, the ui terrible with a mouse and keyboard, this is easily fixed through a mod called skyui however and truly doesnt take away from how mind-blowing and amazing the skyrim adventure is.",180.2
"1. finish game 2. get mods 3. finish game again with mods 4. get more mods 5. finish game again with more mods 6. rinse and repeat for infinite joy",346.7

"absolutely awesome game! the current price (13,59 for the legendary edition) is nothing compared to the adventures u are going to see. endless mods will cause hundreds of gameplay hours full of joy, fascinatiion, beauty and epicness. i reallly recommend this game to all of you! if u like rpg`s ull love this version :)",53.2
"theres only ever a few games that truly standout amongst the rest and this is one of them. although it is just over 3 years old its still got a huge dedicated fanbase, especially on pc with all the mods, texture upgrades etc. mind the few bugs that you can come across, which never broke the game for me it is still a very solid game and still looks immense with all the mods in place. well worth a buy and well worth playing again and again even if it is just so you can play around with mods and decapitate some poor bloke in the woods.",71.1

"this has to be one of, if not, the best, open world rpg game out there. the world is so immersive and beautiful. the game play is great, and the story line is awesome! playing this game is so much better on pc because of all the mods you can also add, if you are into that sort of thing. definitely a must have!",163.9
"it is hard to hold a candle to the hard work and dedication put into the massive array of content within skyrim by bethesda. if you ever want to play a game that has so much content that it would take hundreds if not thousands of hours to experience it all, while still having the capability of updated by the community, and turning out ot be one of the greatest gameplay experiences of all time, skyrim is your game.",171.9
"im wasting my life and im enjoying every second of it.",78.9
"i just cant get enough of this game, im always want some more. and you know what? this game actually can offer you some more: -a lot of quests and ways to solve them; -beatiful locations to explore; -random game events between npcs and monsters which is interesting to watch (group of guards vs badss dragon, wolves pack attacking an npc, etc); -huge amount of mods, most of them just make grass greener, armor shinier, boobs bigger and turn horses into mlp characters, but there is some mods that can comletely change the whole game. you still not satisfied? theres 3 dlc with dragon riding, another dragonborn, new shouts, vampires, wolverines, crossbows, dirty orphans which can be adopt, your own house which you can buy or build, and also marriage (not a greatest decision in your life, but still) waiting for you. and achievement hunting, of course! trully 10/10",93.5

"this game is pretty fun but not superduper fun and it crashes randomly.",214.2
"a masterpiece of modern rpg gaming. if you liked morrowind and fallout 3 / new vegas you will enjoy this a lot. it perfectly paints a picture of a vibrant world. the quests themselves are compelling and will keep you guessing right until their conclusion. feel free to roam around the countryside hunting dragons and mining til your pockets are full!",42.1
"brilliant game, fun, challenging and has lots of hours of gameplay to keep you entertained. i definitely suggest you pick up this game.",64.5

"this game is a must have for any rpg fan. there are tons of quests to do and lots of land to explore. all the side quests are very good but the main quest line has a little dullness to it. the graphics and scenery are beautiful but some of the environment can be a little dark and dirty. character customization is one of the best in any rpg; you can literally play any type of character you want, and you can switch playing styles at any point without making a new character. this is one of the most fun and adventurous games that i have ever played. its simply amazing.",17.7
"great game, graphical not so good, but gameplay fantastic! getting tired of playing games that you need to do the main quest to unlock special things? not in this game! here you can go from dragonborn to just a normal farmer in no time! and with amazing side-quests this game will just become unstoppable!",258.4
"even long after the announcement that bethesda is closing out im still playing the basic version and finding little things i missed/forgot/sped by. its not one of the biggest open worlds, but this is plenty of cave crawling (about half) you still have a lot of exploring to do.",378.1
"(6.6.14 edit) finished vanilla and all three dlcs. finished all 75 achievements. the game with its radiant questing system and open world exploring will never leave you lacking for content. the mod community is the strongest for any pc game on the market, and some of the mods like falskaar and wyrmstooth are dlc-sized new lands. skyrim is a place where you can create any adventurer you want without having to fit into rpg tropes. it is graphically beautiful, especially when modded, and offers endless amounts of replayability. the sounds and evnvironment are immersive, also improved with modding. this is as close as there is to a perfect game. (caveat: dawnguard was not all that great...but dragonborn is epic. that makes up for it.) (5.17.14) well. hours played = enough said. depth of game plus mod community are enough to keep you entertained for literal months on end. i dont think its a stretch to say this is the greatest rpg ever made. and thats coming form a final fantasy fan.",680.8

"if you havent gotten this game yet, get it. my hours on steam dont do justice, ive put well over 2,000 hours on this game on the ps3. the game is massive, and every inch of it is filled up with something to do. every playthrough is different. you wont get bored.",13.9
"forgot how much fun this game was. i can run this game at ultra settings and i have to say it looks amazing for a game that came out in 2011. i bough the legendary edition and why wouldnt you for 13 dollars. and i only played the dawngaurd dlc and it was way worth it the game is still fun to play even without the dlc. overall this game is still a 10/10",38.6
"a game that is complicated to critique. for the first 30-50 hours, you will be completely absorbed in the beautiful and vast world, with seemingly endless opportunities for exploration and questing. as you continue to play, the cracks start to show. the gameplay systems are incredibly shallow, the characters wooden, the world still beautiful but the dungeons copy/pasted 120 times over with the same enemies, the same meaningless loot. the complication arises when you realize that while you are slowly starting to loathe the game, youve had 30+ hours of fun before hitting that point. so the question is, was it worth it?",67.6
"skyrim is great. great graphics, great gameplay, and great story. i highly suggest.",171.6

"first game i played, i accidentally killed a chicken in riverwood and then had to kill most of the towns population in self-defense. instead of becoming a heroic knight like originally planned, i become a mass murderer on the run from the law. i didnt choose the thug life, the thug life chose me. 10/10 would kill chicken again.",51.7
"skyrim is the fantastic follow-up to oblivion. you know the drill: swords, shields, magic (greatly improved). only this time there is a new threat..........dragons!!!!!! beautiful, immersive, compelling. play it now.",113.8
"good game! best game i ever played! no lagging because...the background is real! the mountains the sky and stuff..its real! 11/10 xd",382.1
"its a good game for sure, but its not the masterpiece people claimed it was when it released. i havent played since the new patches or mods, so well... ill just say this: i played a sword and shield character. i killed my first dragon the same way i killed the final boss. hit, block, bash, repeat. overpriced dlc. still recommended. lots of fun to be had.",113.1
"honestly. without any mods at all, this game is a strong 7/10. it has the base for what is a great modding project. it has an engaging story that builds on a large catalogue of games worth of lore and backstory. it has a fair graphical setup, though it is shamelessly consolized. sound design is good and gameplay is solid. the game gives you a great ammount of freedom so that you can make the game into what you want. you can ignore the story completely and just forge your own story throughout skyrim, or spend hours just doing sidequests, or maybe just spend your gametime becoming the ultimate enchater. anything is possible. a fair game worth your time and money. but that all changes when mods enter the ring. when mods enter the ring this game becomes the jungle-gym of modern games. you can do anything you want. want to turn skyrim into a tropical paradise? theres a mod for that. want to turn all the dragons into characters from my little pony or thomas the tank engine? you can do that. you can even make skyrim into the most realistic looking and playing game ever (minus the dragons/mosters/spooky ghosts). with mods, this game is amazing. the game is your oyster in any way you want. and that is why you play it. summary: holy  this game is good. 10/10",425.8

"bethesda did it again! a fun rpg that you will spend countless hours into, 100% worth the $60 i paid. plus on the pc version you get so many epic mods by the many communitys of mod makers. 9.5/10 goty rpg 2011",670.8
"brilliant game, such a shame my laptop isnt fast enough to play it at full potential :(",4.9
"fully recommened!! an awesome game which promises more than 200 gaming hours.",387.2
"i also played 80+ hours of this game on xbox 360. skyrim, is one of my most favorite games of all time. the story in the game is very good and it is not connected with previous elder scrolls games. the graphics are really good as well. there is so much to do in skyrim i still havent done everything in 108+ hours. you dont get to make that many game changing decisions like fallout but you do get to make some. the dlc are also good and can be used in the normal game as well. one suggestion would be to either get the strategy guide or look online for info on what skyrim has to offer because not everything is shown how to do it, like brewing you have to try fail/suceed or just know what to do. after playing for so long, there is always something that i havent seen or done. i am dragonborn, fus ro da!",111.9
"not as good as morrowind, but very pretty, and the engine is fairly solid for modding. im pretty sure that is where bethesda focused its energy, such as with other titles like those in the fallout universe. 10/10 would avoid main quest and go straight to the theives guild.",106.3
"crazy fun, but dont buy if you are crunched for time. time disapears while you play.",195.2
"played through on 360, beat regular skyrim. playthrough 2 on ps3, dabbled in legendary, long way to go before complete. got legendary on pc, testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 play-throughs. especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to, ive done all these fn quests before, its great to be able to just go grab all the games keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your play-through without trivial bs. also, thomas the truck.  yeah. oh, one more thing, it looked good on 360. it looked great on ps3. it loads a billion times faster and plays way smoother on pc. got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience ive ever had.",13.3
"im just going to break this down into litte sections: graphics: outstanding! story: great. gameplay: awesome! dlc: i dont know, dont have any of the dlc",129.2
"got this during the winter sale, could not be happier. honestly this game has unlimited options as far as mods go and it is one of those games where you lose track of time. i am not a huge fan of rpgs but for me skyrim is more than that. i would reccomend getting this game even at full price. i cant express enough how enjoyale it really is.",5.8
"a fun addicting fantasy game, failry addicting especially if you make the right decisions in the game, the novelty soon wares off after a couple of weeks playing but still i nice game i would recommend, the large mountanous enviroment would be appealing for those aesthetic gamers out there",79.2

"skyrim....hm...it is not as good as i hoped it is. but dont get blinded about that, it is still a really great game. the game itself is really entertaining. you can spend hours and hours just in farming for armor or stuff like that. this game has awesome quests. a great atmosphere. a huge world and a lot of stuff to do. . the world is not colorful so often. more like a boring grey, but you have to remember : this game is full modable. and this is the amazing stuff what skyrim makes so great. that you can mod as much as you want. you can design your own skyrim. from the little flowers to the huge mountains and dragons. the fighting system is really cool, so is the stealth system. it is one of my favourite elder scrolls game besides morrowind. as an elder scrolls fan you should not even think about buying this game. just do it. no regrets, no doubt about it. 9,5/10",77.5
"skyrim is simply the most amazing world editor game you can play. its exactly what a hard core game wants. the game isnt about fantasy or slaying dragons at all forget that , its about spending hundreds of hours configuring and reconfiguring .ini files and debugging why boobs dont bounce right or why physix mods cause horses to fly during the opening credits. i wanted to create the most beautiful, perfect, real world experience, before starting out my quest. 155 hours in and 100 mods deep i created my perfect experience then i got all the expansions and broke the mods and look forward to going thru it all again! im serious when i say i get more satisfaction tweaking a game then actually playing it. skyrim is aging like a fine wine.",155.5

"this game. for starters i am a huge fan of bethesda games and elder scrolls series. after absolutely  oblivion i was circumed to buying skyrim. originally bought on my ps3, i grabbed it as a bargain in the steam sales and exams has been a blocker for me. the mods are simple but great and it has a gripping storyline. one of the best games ive ever played. to put you in the steps of the saviour of tamriel again is a great feeling. would recommend to everyone and their grandmas. 11/10",62.1
"one of my favorite games. this game has given me hundreds of hours of entertainment, fun, suspense, and over-all enjoyment. ive restarted this game several times over, and each time, i find something new. i dont think ill ever truely beat this game, but thats the fun in it. no matter how many times you play it, theres always something new.",24.6

"the elder scrolls games are all masterpieces in their own right, but skyrim is truly the crowning glory of this series. from the details given to each race and the extremely custumizable factor from character creation to even your own varied playstyle, skyrim allows you to be exactly who you wish while immersing you in a wildly beautiful land full of adventure and oppportunity. let wanderlust take hold and your instincts guide you through battles with fierce dragons and bands of armed bandits. this game is so feature rich that its difficult to summarize in a short review. its best that anyone who hasnt done so yet just go for it. you will not be disappointed.",13.6
"simply put, one of the best games i have ever had the opportunity to play, the graphics are incredible, the story is rich in content and the dialog is realistic and not overly dramatic, allowing you to immerse yourself in your adventures within skyrim and not realize that 14 hours have gone by sense you started playing. i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games that provide more then just shiny graphics, but also a rich story and vast hours of content that can be replayed in litterally dozens of different ways. -daggaroth",124.7
"even though this is almost 4 years old now, i find it more enjoyable than the current newer releases albeit if you use mods. speaking of which, ive been spending more time modding it rather than playing the damn game lol. money well worth spent with infinite as well as enjoyable replay value.",640.4

"the elder scroll v: skyrim is the latest installment in the elder scrolls series. with revamped combat/ magic systems, skyrim is sure to have a newer, more refreshing feel to the gameplay. skyrim sports an inumerable amount of content which can be played again and again in one of the largest worlds to ever grace a video game. combat in skyrim however can feel a little more rigid than in previouse installments. many of the larger fights will require you to pause in multiple occassions so that you could switch weapons/ spells or even heal up with a potion. with no true hotkeys, combat just feels a little less pleasing when you have to pause time to switch that one spell. over all, skyrim is a very well done video game which will provide many hours of gameplay.",58.3

"i played and beat it on my ps3 in spite of its irritating issues with overheating my then brand new system. i got the game again on steam and still love it. its fun, interactive and above all customizable. thats not to say there arent issues. but the flaws that exist, at least in my mind, are out weighed by its positives. worth the money and time investment.",129.3

(athletics and acrobatics dont even exist now) dragon fights should be the most awesome thing in the game, but instead you get a dumb dragon who haves glitchy movements and when he fly get your  prepared, you will laught a lot. the ai is pure trash and more if we talk about followers. when a dragon or vampires attack a city get ready cause in time ppl will die, and at the end the city will be the desert.(when the citizen should hide in a house or a castle, they prefer to dont give a  so they fight and die in a moment). the game is meh, but if you compare it to other tes games its pure trash. ive played morrowind and oblivion a lot or too much and only used 1 mod for oblivion to get better faces and had so much fun with both of them, but in skyrim its necessary have a lot of mods just to make the game avarage and a game should be good it self not with mods. now that the game cost only 15$ you can buy it, its not exactly worth it as the game is not finished, but the mods will help.",36.8

"i have always been a fan of the elder scrolls ever since morrowind back in 2002 and in my opinion this is a great sequel. skyrim is the most stunning game to look at in the elder scrolls seris however some graphical gltiches occur. skyrim has also the best modding community so far as after more than 3 years mod delvepors either in the nexus or the workshop are still cranking out great mods to help enchance the game. in the end you must play this game if you are looking for a great rpg experince or just a great game.",317.5

"really fun game. i had it on ps3, but i couldnt get into it. the graphical quality was pretty bad, and i wasnt a fan of the controls. on pc, you can get the hd texture pack if you have a good graphics card, and turn the settings up. it looks great, and plays well. also, theres console commands, so if youre in trouble, you can get yourself out of it. controls in combat are a bit odd, because weapons are inverted for your mouse buttons, but i swapped them. takes a bit of getting used to, but its much better. you can explore and discover new places, and fight bandits in dungeons. you can create potions and armor, buy a house to store your stuff in, and take on many different quests. you can join different factions as well, even become a werewolf. great game, would buy. if you dont have 30 bucks, wait up until its on sale and grab legendary edition.",71.6

"after hearing allot of hype i was dissapointed by skyrim. yes there is a ton of content, pretty graphics, and plenty of combat and crafting; but the game fails to be a good role playing game. seldom are you given any real choices. perhaps this is because the protagionist is very convoluted; not only are you the dragon bourne but also a leader of every other minor faction in skyrim. the game generally punishes you for trying to play your character as anything other than gun for hire; if you turn down many of the morally inconsistent things youre asked to do, you generally miss out on missions. skyrim does many things extremely well, but messes up the basic role playing aspect i look for in an rpg.",87.1

"the elder scrolls 5: skyrim is a very good game. it was my first elder scrolls game and it was the game that launched my love for bethesdas 1st person roll playing games like fallout 3 & new vegas and the elder scrolls 3 through 5. hardcore fans of the series might not like skyrim due to its more easier questline but i think that is unfair to say. yes skyrim is easier than say morrowind but that is not truely a bad thing. skyrim does many things nicely. the environment is huge and interesting to explore. they added dragons, i mean freakin dragons!!! they also fixed some of the leveling so now you dont have to sleep to level up and there are perks you can get. also now when talking to an npc it no longer pauses the game. tes 5: skyrim is a very good game i highly recomend it. it is amazing but still not my favorite edler scrolls game, i am sorry skyrim but morrowind is my favorite just due to its environment and story were a little bit better. but i put the most time into skyrim, enjoy! -effencrazy",284.7

"if you liked tes4, youll love tes5 - skyrim does what oblivion did, but better. what bethesda lacks in the story-telling department (and some others) they make up for by being - hands down - the best in the industry at creating interesting worlds to explore. bethesda games are *very* exploration- and side-quest-heavy and this one is no different; if youre only interested in the main story youll breeze through skyrim in 4-6 hours. however, there is an abundance of quests (about 400) that arent connected to the main story and a ton of stuff to explore. if that kind of open-world feeling is what youre looking for in a game, youll easily get 100+ hours of enjoyment out of skyrim. there also is the creation kit, which will be released later in january and will, theoretically, allow for endless amounts of user-created content.",450.0

"played this not registered on steam over 1000 hours. after awhile it get tedious and easy, but with the great community of nexus you can enhance your roleplaying experience beyond. try to survive the harsch climate of skyrim with the mod frostfall added and remember to sleep, eat, drink and stay in clean places with the realistic needs and diseases mod. those two are just a few ways to enhance the gameplay. moddin the game for your fifth and there after play through are almost essential. 11/10.",104.3
"cons: i was a little disappointed that theres no sense of urgency with any of the quests. people will make off hand remarks about knowing you, but what you do for one town has no meaningful impact anywhere else. lots of walking compounding the issue with lots of walking, horses are pretty buggy if you dont keep to the roads. very easy to randomly fall to your death over what looks like a tiny drop on a horse. combat is a little bland long, unskippbale cut scene at the begining pros: interesting story great graphics large world good crafting lots of neat player housing great modding comunity overall i thought it was a good game, but maybe not quite as good as all the hype. definitely worth picking up though.",239.3

"first of all, if you havent heard of this game by now, you should check it out right away. it was probably the best 40 i invested in my gaming career and it still after 200 hours offers an insane amount of fun. there is simply so much to do and so many things to discover. with all the skills and the rich backstory, this is just the pinnacle of any rpg. the graphics are beautiful even without any mods, and you can actually empathize with some of the characters. of course, you can become a rampant mage-warrior-orc, but the holds are so beautiful and on higher difficulties any enemy becomes dangerous. i recommend playing on a higher difficulty, because then it feels like you are really on a quest. tons and tons of fun to be had with this game!",208.2

"the elder scrolls: skyrim is a game, wich you cannot describe with words. skyrim is a nice place, with lots quests to aquire and complete with style. also, skyrim, as a game is incredibly customizable experience, since you can build your own hero as you want it to be. you can choose to be bad or good, and choose your own behaviour and things you do. also the combat system and customization is incredibly advanced and stylish. you wish to be an archer in long distance combat, and a heavy melee on close combat, be my guest, skyrim will be the place to do it. the graphics of skyrim are very nice and realistic but there are many modifications in workshop wich will allow the higher end computers to use the lost power and make skyrim even better on the graphics and realism. and last but not least, i would recommend skyrim to any gamers that wish to get a good storyline, an action filled adventurous medieval simulator :d",63.9

"if you like rpg first/third person games and most of all free roam than skyrim is a game for you. sure the story isnt as well developed as oblivion was but the number of mods and the detail in side quests makes this game get an a+ in my books sure the graphics arent as good as the crysis series but after all the game was made in 2007. one more thing the game tends to have many bugs",118.2
"been playing for more than 200 hours on another account, this game is amazing! 9.5/10",72.5

"exceptional game, a++ highly recommend to any person even remotely interested in open world games.",237.7
"one of my favorite game. amazing graphics. amazing gameplay. amazing amaze.",17.1
"with the dragonborn dlc i have set the order of the story some what backwards. and now wish that there was a way to save alduin. because perhaps his complaint is that miraak was a jerk. or what ever but. i must wonder since it was alduin who saves me from the chopping block. please share!",277.9
"i have not enjoyed a game this much since morrowind, bethesda really outdid themselves with this game: the physics actually works for the most part, dragon fights are epic and magic is finally a viable option in an elder scrolls game.",126.6
"quite possibly the greatest game ever made at the moment. free roam rpgs are the future! now to get this delorean to 88mph so i can play future games of this style! fallout 4 next please.",657.1
"the game itself is a masterpiece of storytelling, mechanics and lore. just cant believe how compelled i am to always come back to it. i started on xbox and loved it so much that i bought it on pc too and gave that modding thing a shot. cant tell you how great the modding community is and the endless possibilities it provides to the gameplay experience. a definite buy!!! fun, fun, fun!",104.2
"i cant say enough about this game. between my wife and i, we have played over 300 hrs of this game. it will immerse you in a world full of adventure, fantasy and rich lore. there are a ton of mods for this game which allows you to customize the game how you want it if you are not happy with the vanilla version. you will definitley get your moneys worth out of this game with the length of the campaign along with side quests and replay value. if you are a fan of western rpgs or enjoyed any of the previous elder scrolls or fallout games, get this game now!",160.1
"great game open world more time i want to play it to clear all mission , awesome it more more mission to play this game has real life ...",44.2
"this game is so amazing. there is so much you can do, from fighting dragons in about 50 different ways to making tons of different weapons and armors, making potions that affect you health or your magica. you can do almost anything you want. and with the dlcs dawngaurd and dragonborn it adds many features like becoming all powerful vampire lord or even riding a dragon! i highly reccomend this game because along with everything i have listed there is much, much more and if that doesnt apeal to you then go ahead and download the skyrim nexus mod manager and install all the mods you would like. i personally recomment a unmodded playthroguh at first, i feel use visual mods immerse you the most. but other mods and hotfixes are useful. a wopping 9.9 skeevers out of 10. still not as good as fallout. its like skyrim... with guns",260.9
"what can i say honstly? its one of the better rpgs of this generation. i dont know how much longer we will get its like. its not dumbed down, it just flows nicely. but its massive...and that kinda rules.",140.5
"this game runs like a dream on my pc and i have the minimum requiremants, and i have it on high settings too! highly fun gameplay coupled with smooth performance makes me a very happy customer and i bet it will make you happy too!",141.0
"this is seriously one of my favorite games of all time. the land is so immense, youll never run out of things to do. while it didnt take very long to complete the main quest, there are so many side quests, minor quests, and guild quests to complete. its definitely worth the money to buy it!",76.2
"buy 1 game + 3 dlcs, get mods, and then you have infinite games.",213.2
"my girlfriend made me play it. now she complains when i play it too much when shes on her period. i wish i was the dragonborn so i could use bend will on her, on account of the fact that shes kind of like a dragon around that time. maybe shed listen to what i had to say for once. then i could finally hop on her back and shed fly around and stuff and id throw fireballs at everyone. apparently, its too much to ask for. im a dope fin wizard, respect my authority woman. i dont remember what outside looks like, but i can sure as hell navigate the province of skyrim like its nothing. can i sleep on your couch when she reads this review?",15.9
"i recommend this for gamers who like: open world or rpgs. issues: the only issues i had were maybe the graphics which i fixxed through mods. other than that, i dont have any issues with the game. story: you are the dragonborn who ends up getting caught by the imperials. you later arrive in helgen about to get your head chopped along with the fellow stormcloaks who also got caught along with a horse thief. just before you get your head chopped off, a dragon attacks helgen. as you try to escape you can go with either ralof(a stormcloak rebel) or hadvar(an imperial soldier). afterwards you can do almost whatever you want, thats what i like about open world games. you can continue through the main quest or do side quests. either way, in the end you kill alduin(the final dragon). note: i chose the stormcloaks side and havent had the time to go through the imperials side of the story yet. therefore i cant add-on to the story very well when i leave out the imperials side of it. if you have any questions, ask me and ill answer them as best as i can.",311.5
"hope you have a powerful computer when you get this because it will be realy boring if you dont. its the visuals that matter",452.9
"the elder scrolls 5: skyrim is a role playing epic of the ages. having played skyrim on console with 500+ hours, i can honestly say that on day 1 of pc gaming i enjoy it much more. fantastic experience, save for minor frame rate problems. 9/10",94.7
"well to start off nice and positive, - the game has a lot of content to keep you entertained for hundreds of hours - mod support on steam is great - over 1000+ weapons and armor (including enchanted versions of the same armor/weapon) - story telling is fairly good now to end it with a little bit of negatives, - game contains a few bugs here and there - would be nice to have online support (just a joke here) ;d great game, worth the money if you have no already purchased it.",96.9
"beat the crap out of a old man with my fists and killed a dragon with my fists. then tried to beat the crap out of a old man on top of a moutain then got turned into ice as i rolled down the mountain at mach 10. ended up in morrowind. still havent unfroze someone send help please.",115.5

"again, i havent got as much play time on pc, but on xbox, i have heaps (minimum 250 hrs) become the strongest person in skyrim, the dragonborn, and defeat the dragon threat! the dragons have returned to skyrim, 200 years after the oblivion crisis. they are stronger then ever and are out to inslave the human race again. or, become the arch-mage of the mages collage, or leader of the companions, or maybe the most feared theif in the land! master you voice to defeat the dragons, or help in the civil war. decide your alliance. either the imperials, who fight for skyrim to remain in the empire, or stromcloaks, who fight for independence from the empire. who ever you choose, it will be a great experience for you! many dark secrets await you, in the elder scrolls v: skyrim!",28.3

"thanks to the modding community, im nowhere close to being tired of this game.",693.2
"if you havnt played skyrim until now there is something wrong. best open world rpg so far but witcher 3 and dragon age might change that next year. the vanilla game is decent but the game comes into its own with the mods. rate up from me ;)",130.3
"a brilliant rpg set in a beautifully created world. dragons, ogres and bandits run amok and you can easily lose yourself in the game doing the near infinite amount of quests. be a stealthy assassin or powerful mage and discover the power of the dragonborn while fight for the imperial empire or stormcloak rebellion... if you want to. there is so much to this game that you can spend over 100 hours in it and never touch the main quests and when youre done, it has an extensive modding community to offer new creatures, weapons and entire quests to keep your adventure going.",398.8
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim buy. this. game. the newest installment in the elder scrolls franchise does not disappoint. the multitude of quests, side quests, and scenery will have you coming back again and again. even if youve not played an elder scrolls game before and are unawre of the lore involved, skyrim will get you well aquainted with tamriels history, and provide many hours of entertainment. pros: -quests. many, many quests. -charactor development -charactor customization -multitudes of spells, enchants, weapons, and armor -dlc is worth it -steam workshop gives hours and hours of replayability and enhancements cons: -repeated objectives (go here and retrieve x item) -charactor models a bit lack luster (fixed with mods) if youre looking for a game that has just about everthing in a pseudo medieval setting, then skyrim is for you. if youre not, i still recommend this game",84.5
"this is, in fact, a video game that you will play for moderately long periods of time for your own personal enjoyment, whatever you may define such a thing as.",205.4
"possibly my favourite game of all time. being an avid rpger, this is the perfect game for me as skyrim allows you to totally emerse yourself in the game. it doesnt matter whether you want to wander the map slaying random monsters, stay at home cooking supper and earn an honest living, become a prime dragon hunter, or complete every single quest going - theres something to keep every sort of gamer interested. at the time of writing, ive put in 250+ hours into a single character, and still havent finished most of the available quests (including the main storyline). im having too much fun to rush through the story just to find out what happens at the end - im enjoying everything else skyrim has to offer. thats not to say that the game hasnt got its quirks, but they are easily ignored in comparison to all the great things that the game does offer. if you havent played it yet, do so - dont miss out on playing one of the best games of our generation...",290.2

"well, it is next game in very popular rpg series the elder scrolls from bethesda. it is really amazing game for rpg lovers. open world, two handed combat system and leveling systems are just great. you can also craft a lot of stuff. you can simpy do whatever you want, buy a house, marry a wife or just go to dungeon and kill them all in. i can strongly recommend this game. ps: if you wish to improve graphic experience, just visit skyrimnexus and download some mods. ;-)",115.6
"this game is polished to a mirror shine yet if you look close enough you can see the scratches. its too casual im riding around with my supped up armour and the game feels like it on normal difficulty. another major flaw is the ability to spam the skill tree to level grind with no effort. now onto detailing the detailing is the best ive seen in a large scale game since ever i suppose. the missions are all different and lead you around the world of skyrim the amount of quest are limitless due to the misc quest system in the game. the map layout has enough variety to keep me exploring the rest of skyrim ive only found 194 locations so far and enjoying every minute of it. wheather effects are a huge plus for the game one day it can be raining another day it can snow to the poiint where you cant see the rest of the world or it can be a clear sunny day (my favourite days) part 1",190.9
"its an amazing rpg with and very open world and has more things to do in it than i can count. a few minor glitches set it back but by very little. you can also mod the game to your hearts content. so buy this game. 9001/10",264.8

"do i really have to say why this is one of the best rpg ever ?",59.8
"this game isnt as good as morrowind in my opinion, but with mods, it can make the game perfect. when i get a better pc, i will have way more than 101.1 hours on record. pros: lots of content easy for people who have never played an elder scrolls game to get into lots of freedom cons: buggy (but since were on pc, you have the unofficial skyrim patches) extremely easy (again, can be fixed by mods) over simplified character attributes (theres 3, compared to all of the attributes your character had in morrowind and oblivion) lack of weapon and armor variety (fixed by mods) if youre not willing to use mods, this game has a noticeable amount of flaws.",132.4
"basically fallout with swords and better graphics. being a badass in an open fantasy world full of  npcs is pretty awesome. the game is beyond easy. but its fun and theres lots of story and lore to explore and beautiful vistas to discover.",212.8
"pretty fun. even more fun with lots of mods. turn dragons into macho man randy savange and give mudcrabs top hats & monocles",486.3
"im not one to review a game but this game really screams out at me how fantastic it is. i recommend this to those who enjoy open world free roam games. worth all of the money and theres not much else to say. so get it now",140.2

"skyrim is an excellent rpg capable of suck many hours from your life. it tells numerous engaging stories and delivers an immersive experience in the frozen nothern lands of skyrim. if youve played other elder scrolls titles you have a decent idea of what to expect, if not youre likely going to be pleasantly suprised. the steam workshop mod support for this game open up a contanstly growing database of new, east to install content. well worth the money.",377.8

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"this game seems like the best game ever for a day, week, month, or even a year or two, and then gets boring for a while. skyrim is kind of like life, sometimes it is fast-paced and so many things are happening, and sometimes its just slow, calm, and quiet, which is what this game is trying to accomplish. this game is not perfect, however. there are bugs, glitches, and the fact that it runs slowly sometimes if you dont have the most up-to-date computer (which is what my situation happens to be). some of these bugs can be easily fixed with mods or console commands. this game is great nevertheless, and the fact that so many people are still playing it even when the next game in the series (the elder scrolls online) is out now, shows how great this game is. what makes this game even better is the amount of dlc and mods that the community has made to expand on the game itself. skyrim is a great way to take a break from life, because its amazing immersion can make you forget completely about your problems happening in the real world. i give skyrim a 9.25/10",508.1
"skyyyyyyriiiiiiimmmmm!!!!!!, whats not to love about this game, from its amazing open world to the whole variety of diffrent charicters, and the freedome to make actual dicisions that effect the course of your gameplay!!!!!!!. this game is loads of fun and will keep you entertained for a long time (seriously!). and runs great on the pc, bethesda did a very nice job at ways to fix fps, issues and really put effort into making an amazing game. recomended :d",169.0
"it is a big game, but it is not a deep game. nothing you do in this game matters. you can walk around in the archmages robes and be told to check out the college of winterhold. you can be the leader of the companions supposedly reknowned throughout the land as fearsome warriors and people will ask if you fetch the mead. you can literally slay a dragon known as the world eater and people wont bat an eye. there is no immersion here and the atmosphere is threadbare. the combat is mind-numbingly poor and the ui is poorly designed for pcs. the mage skills are especially poorly balanced, requiring a mod for the destruction school to be effective past level 30. its a decent sandbox but if you want something that will truly let you roleplay, make interesting choices and live with the consequences, this is not that game. if you want a generic fantasy sandbox that you can mod in to something completely different, then you might enjoy it. personally, i cant recommend it.",191.1

"this is the game thats so fun an addicting, that i bought it day of release on xbox 360, played it for three years, then quit xbox for pc, missed skyrim, bought legendary addition, and now playing it nonstop. this game is an all time best rpg only being beaten by oblivion and morrowind (which i also spent money on the dlcs on xbox and then bought on pc with all dlc)",43.2
"this game is an easier to understand version of past elder scrolls games, fairly large sandbox but smaller compared to tes4 however, this game contains more content per square foot, with an absurd amount of quests. good game. it is easy for people new to elder scrolls and sandbox rpgs to get into. as a stand alone game, it is very good, could be the best fantasy sandbox rpg to come out for 5-7 years. the dlc refines this game, though it is not entirely needed for a great experience. the modding community is massive for this game, and credit to them for letting players choose what they want in their gameplay experience. at this point the sky is the limit when it comes to modding, allowing players to fix most of the problems with the game. need bugfixes, mods do that need new weapon designs and choices, mods do that. want the game to look better, mods do that. want to balence out the game more, mods do that. it is a different style of game than tesiii/tesiv but still a very good game. buy it, still better than the $60 games people are releasing three years later.",1349.0

"skyrim is one of the best games that i could have something to do. the graphics are very good, and no doubt the story is compelling. the strength is the variety of weapons and abilities that you can disporre.punto weakness is the amount of bugs in the game. for graphics advice is to try to start with quality standards, and personalize them with a lot of patience to find the ideal set of detail and fluidity of the game. the story in the role of dragons blood is not very long, but the game is enriched with various quests and different guilds. the chance to go around, and wander from the prairies to the cold mountains makes the game more exciting. im sorry i only tried one of the dlc on sale ... (in which i risontrato other bugs, but were eliminated with updates). the overall grade is the story 90/100 (which i expect longest), 95/100 and 90 for the graphics for the game as a whole. i recommend it guys",85.3

"how do i describe this piece of divine magnificence? this game is absolutely brimming with possibilites. there is a main storyline in which you have to defeat the big bad dragon, but this is only the tip of the iceberg of the other number of plotlines you can become involved in. currently, my ocd is driving me to gain the last five achievements, but i definitely do not find this a chore. i am 100+ hours into gameplay and i am still finding brand new locations and quests to immerse myself in. right now, i just cant stop living in skyrim.",310.8

"even after almost 3 years, this game is just great! there is alot to do and to explore, and the modding community has alot of other great things. there are some bugs in the game tough, but im sure there are some fixes for those bugs in the steam workshop or somewhere else on the internet so they can be fixed.",136.2
"i loved this game, best first person game i ever played",60.6
"my prelimenary opinion would be that this game is even more awesome than the ones that came before. i was a big gamer when it came to oblivion and i do miss some of the pleasant features of that game in the skyrim gameplay. luckely, in my opinion, the conversationwheel was parted with. a big plus for skyrim is the smithing-feature as are the dragons obviously and the medieval, scandinavian, mythological feeling in-game. regarding to the use of magic, i think it was a great move on the part of the developpers to go with these shouts...very well done. each factions, race, etc. is now even more diverse than in previous games. a big point of critique is that bethesda still has a lot men and women in the game talking in the same voice (but of course it is obvious as to why that is so). the vanilla world map could use some improvement, if you are against using mods for this. as a big fan over the series, i think a 9 out of 10 (with oblivion being 8,5 and morrowind a 7) is an appropriate mark for the elder scrolls v skyrim.",79.3
"i just find this title to be amazing, and im being completely honest with you. the game is very modable, you can create your own scenarios either in the console or its creation kit. its dlc is a great addition to the experience as well. hearthfire for example, lets me build my own living stead or estate. if you are one of those people who get sick of playing modern shooters all the time and want to try a medieval type of pc gaming experience, then you might want to pick this title up on steams marketplace.",151.1

"tbh, i was dissapointed with oblivion. it was not the fantasy alien work of morrowind. skyrim is like a spoof of oblivion. the dialogue is obnoxious compared to the past serious es games. the map, once you have seen it, that is the end of interest pretty much, there are alot of areas on the map that i thought were a fail. strange but oblivion and fallout3 were much better designed games. believe it or not. skyrim is not terrible, but i found it impossible to interact, like or believe any of the character npcs. definitely not enough khajit.",6.3

"behold this magnificent rpg! this game is like that one brand of chocolate that is better than the rest. it does have other common factors in rpgs (leveling up, magicka and health bars, etc.), but mixes the flavors in its own creamy kind of way. the world is large and enjoyable to explore, and the combat and conversation system has beeen improved over oblivion. id highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to enter the rpg genre.",55.1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim let me start by saying that i am not a big fan of the series. i had my doubts ,actually, when i bought this one. but after 70 hours of gameplay i could say that this one is by far one of the best games ive ever played. price: 19,99 $ genre: fantasy,adventure pros: + this game is huge + smart crafting system + many skills to master (archery,alchemy,one handed weapons and many more..) + engaging story + nice soundtrack + class styled gameplay: (warrior,assassin,mage...) *but you can always change your fighting style + awesome graphics (i play this on low quality and graphics are still dayum) + never ending variety of weapons,armors,potions.. cons: - ai acts dumb sometimes - too ing many satanic references - buggy at certain quests conclusion its worth your money.every last cent of it!seriously stop reading this..go buy it!",343.6

"skyrim was my first game in the elder scrolls series so my approach is unbiased. this game can only be described as epic and well though out. the hours of development can be seen and felt in the hours of gameplay provided. this is a game loved by its creators. skyrim takes place in the fourth age. reading the countless books of lore found in skyrim, ive been piecing together the history of tamriel. this is a big world with tons of history and lore. the graphics are stunning in the vanilla (un-modded) version and enhanced even more through the hi-res dlc. the sight and sounds of skyrim really put you into the role. with the release of the creation kit, the skyrim gameplay never ends. thousands of mods created by the community intensify game mechanics, maximize visuals, and add hundreds of hours of gameplay through more quests and locations to conquer. i have enjoyed skyrim so much that i have purchased morrowind and oblivion as well. im looking forward the the elder scrolls vi.",382.3

"this is the best game ever!!! next to fallout:new vegas and gmod and dayz",55.0
"this is absolutely the best fantasy game ive ever played!",153.7
"great game one of the best games i play, u dont have to follow the quests so u can just explore but the start can be kinda laggy but it stops as soon as the start is over.",96.6
"skyrim... where to start, skyrim is one of my most played games and possibly one of my favourites. how ever skyrim can be improved upon. this task is easy with a few mods. now to the review. skyrim is an amazing open world game set in the mythical land of skyrim this being the 5th installment of the aclaimed elder scrolls series has to be the best so far. in the 500+ hours of game time i have enjoyed nearly every minute of it. how ever the combat is a bit bland when compared to other games set in roughly the same time period, however this is not to be frowned upon its a great game for relaxing or just getting immersed in as you follow the story of the dragonborn on his epic quest to slay the eater of worlds i rate this game 8.5/10 be warned once you start playing sneak archer its hard to play any other styles!",853.9
"awsum also get the oblivion and morrowind and even get the daggerfall and arena",156.0
"skyrim is one of those games where its all too easy to get lost in the world. want to be all things to all people? sure thats doable, if youve 200 hours to spare. want to just wander in a random direction? that might actually cost you a full real world day each time you stumble on some other beautiful nook or dungeon squirreled away. in short, its a wonderful and immersive experience, my only advice would be craft a personal narrative. decide who your avatar is, what their motivations are, and what they are talented at early on. itll help keep the gameplay from feeling schizophrenic.",26.8
"at first i thought this game would be boring, but after getting farther into the story i came to enjoy it! its a very good game!",55.4
"i love almost everything that bethesda makes and this game is the best one yet. i hope the next fallout game uses some of the new features this game presented us. the dlcs are good add-ons and the creation kit makes this even more fun if you want to create your own content.",672.6
"this game is awesome. my opinion great story so far and good graphics. i would really reccomend it to a rpg fan",6.8
"love this game! you will always have many tens of quests to complete so if one is to hard you can simply leave it go level up with other missions and then come back. it is so easy to lose yourself wandering the free open world jkilling wolfs and clearing out the odd badit fort or cave as you go. so many hours of gameplay to be had in this amazing game.",278.8
"the spiritual successor of elder scrolls iii morrowind - this game has everything that was missing from oblivion. a mixture of the awesome world design and such from morrowind, and the graphics from oblivion. words cant describe how good this game is.",174.2
"gorgeous, stunning and simply amazing game... one of the few that can be called a masterpiece!",128.6
"i am in love with this game, the fun never ends. the 3 main types of characters you can be have so much depth. plus you can combine 2 of the types or even 3. it is deffinatly a fun game. plus with all the mods you can get it makes it even more fun. take that console plebs",366.1

"i defeated alduin with the fellowship of the ring and then left them in sovngarde. 10/10",62.6
"one of the most engrossing games ive played in a long time. you have to be able to sit down and play it without distractions as its hard to get into a quest then half way through and quit the game to come back to it!",51.8
"well what can you say...? just one word really. epic in the age of games where you pay 60 euros for 8 hours of luke warm entertainment. this game will take you on a journey that lasts months. great quests and storyline following on from the successes of oblivion.",495.5

"going through my game list i just saw that i have over 400 hours on this game. i dont understand, how this is possible. i havent even finished the main quest yet. barley began the quest line of the first expansion, and not even finished the starter quest of the second expansion. i have yet to fully explore skyrim. of the 8 holds (skyrim districts) i only explored 5 of them. i dont know how many more hours it will take me until i finished the main quest and the two expansions. how many more to see everything, but thank i godi took breaks playing this game. because if you play straight from start to finish, having maybe over 1000 hours of play behind you, you will be fluid in the ancient dragon tongue, recite the theme song from your memory and likely need a guidance consular to help you take your first steps back in the real world. so immersive is this game experience. in the years to come it wont be possible to take people serious that havent played this game.",401.9
"fantastic addition to the elder scrolls series. much better than oblivion and as immersive as morrowind.",213.7
"skyrim is an epic, action filled game, similar to lord of the rings, game of thrones and dragon age. great graphics, amazing monsters and beasts, (dragons, trolls, skeletons, etc.) and fine combat situations. i like to play skyrim with mods, making it sometimes even better than it already is. please consider playing skyrim, which is in fact the fifth game in a series. play oblivion too, the game before skyrim.",477.2
"why cant i stop playing this game?!? ill tell you why, because it has great writing, good graphics, and an immersive quality the likes of which ive never seen. the dynamic music system always seems to keep the right tone at the right time just like a big-budget movie. just dont rush from pointer to pointer. take your time. light up the dungeon with a torch or candlight spell and take in the artwork.",444.3
"this game us amazing, great mods and overall worth 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",23.5
"an amazing game, so much so that i bought it for pc too (i own it on xbox 360 with 500+hours). i would seriously recommend this game to any avid rpg fan, it has a rich lore which will keep you entertained for hours on end.",22.5
"one of the best rpgs in recent time. there is so much you can do that i dont even know where to start. if you like warriors/mages and dragons, then you will love this game. there is so much to explore that you will get lost after a while. you can follow the main quest line or you can wander off and do your own thing and come back to the main quest anytime. there are tons of sides quests, so you will never be bored.",384.8
"this game is great for people who are looking for a good way to pass a few hours as you can explore the vast area of skyrim as well as slay dragons, get better equipment or if youre in the mood kill inicent people that live in the citys",14.6
"nice and realistic game . everyone shoud try it :)",12.3

"get this game.. i literally have clocked in 1,000 hours. to good to pass up",1294.7
"despite having a ton of individual features that are nothing special when looked at closely, skyrim as an entire game is incredibly engaging, and inexplicably awesome. worth playing for anyone without arrow-related knee injuries.",215.1
"this game is just essential for any gamer wanting to make that leap from casual gaming to hardcore gaming, it is by no means a hardcore game, but, oh man, its a good game",197.6
"it may be getting a bit of a old game now, and even though it has no multiplayer its still an amazing game",12.2

"personal rating: 9 of 10 one of the best game of the year. great story, awesome graphics fantastic gameplay, tonnes of sub quests and execellent mod community. given there are bugs here and there and that is my only beef with the game but most of the bugs can be resolve in the unofficial mod. if you are a fan of rpg games this is a must have!",320.6
"still one of the best rpgs out there. complain about how simplistic it is all you want, its got great feeling combat and literally hundreds of quests. the quests are technically infinite, just repeated with certain values changed. a huge map with a few greats dlcs and it goes for cheap now - buy it.",54.8
"addicting fantasy-rpg game. buy this as soon as you can!",87.2
"been going for a while now, still the best game there is!",96.0
"amazing rpg, with excellent mod support. extreme replayability!",50.8
"got laid over 50 times in a week. left skyrim open on my gaming pc overnight by mistake and woke up covered in es.",61.2
"besides pokemon as a child, this is probably the most time engaging and entertaining game i have played. every playthrough is different and for me there is still hundreds of hours of content still to do on top of what i have already done on ps3 and xbox. mods add an entirely new view into the world and lore of skyrim, but besides that, the vanilla version is easily one of the best games i have played. if youre debating on whether or not to buy it, keep in mind its not for everyone, but if you like an open world with amazing lore and hundreds of hours to play through, then this is a game for you.",7.9
"skyrim is an amazing rpg and i always find myself playing it.. the communities mods are really good and make the game much better than having it on an xbox or ps3.",111.0
"its just... one of those games that once you beat the campaign, theres still so much to do. and with dlc and mods, you can keep playing forever. i used to play skyrim... but then i took nothing to the knee (i still play skyrim).",125.6

"op best game ever made until now. doesnt matter what they say about inquisition, skyrim will always be in my soul. doesnt matter if they say you can just download it, its offline i dont give a , just support the ing game, because its epic.",115.3
"on the subject on editing my previous review, i will. lets be honest here, i love this game, it is so ing addicting and fun. the graphics and audio are great and i love the open world experience. seriously, this game combines all my favorite genres in one. it really is unlimited quests. but if were technically speaking here, theres a few problems with tes: v s. one is that there is a good amount of glitches that really stop you from playing a quest. also the combat system is repetitive. but that doesnt matter skyrim, because ill keep coming back for more! 9.5/10",803.6
"i hate this game, bethesda shouldnt make garbage like this. i mean who even wants to play a game called the elder scrolls: skyrim? call of duty ghosts is much better, since it has dogs, and noscopes. you cant even noscope in this game, this game ing blows.",41.3
"endless hours of fun and exploring. everything ive come to expect from the elder scrolls franchise. this game does not disappoint.",15.4
"this is without a doubt one of better open rpg games i have played. i first bought it for ps3 but a few years later i fixed up my old computer and one of the first games i bought was of course skyrim. and i gotta say, its alot better on pc for two reasons. the first being that you can enhance the graphics to make it look so much better. and the second, thanks for steam workshop you can input mods so much easier and make your gaming experiance alot more pleasant.",133.9
"if this game was a potato, it would be a good potato.",2.7

"what can i say? the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best (and most addictive) games i have ever played. even years after its release many people still play this masterpiece. the community has also added hundreds more hours worth of play time through the mods found on the steam workshop and the nexus. definately worth your time (although be careful you dont play it too much...) i would rate it 10/10 for sure.",627.1
"very fun game with hours of enjoyment and exploration!",6.7
"like many a gamer out there - to me a new elder scrolls game is a big deal. i absolutely loved the last game, oblivion, and its open, free-roaming role-playing... so its pretty exciting to be back in the land of tamriel for a whole new adventure.",1.8
"please everyone go buy this game! i love it! i can not get enough of this amazing gameplay!",52.9
"a very addictive game. you will never notice when the time has passed while playing this game.",172.5
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"skyrim is one of my favourite games ever! its a fantasy,rpg were your choices make your own story. if you get it one steam you can get mods and make the game even more fun :d. i would rate this game 10 out of 10 for the pc!",66.0
"one of the best video games ive ever played. the elder scrolls series is ridiculously huge, and just when you think youve done everything there is to do, theres that one guy that gives you a quest. main quest is really interesting, many guilds like theives guild, dark brotherhood, companions fighters guild, college of winterhold mages guild, all sorts of things. draws on concepts from tes iv: oblivion, but with a lot more refining and of course the addition of shouts, which really make the game interesting. creation kit is free with it, so you can make your own mods and quests and areas and the game is really endless. i highly recommend this game, hell of a good job bethesda!",798.1
"very very good game it is amazing on all subjects it has an amazing story line followed by fun side quests and the flawless graphics just complete my belief this is one of the best games i have ever played",36.8

"so lets get into a real review. of course this is an amazing game. you should buy it before any other elder scrolls, the main story is greatly tied together with the civil war going on in skyrim. i love this game and yes i recommend it.",299.1

"after 50+ hours in skyrim i can say that this game is huge and amazing. it has some glitches here and there but you have to take it as a whole, and the game is massive. there will be few times, that you might lost interest in the story, but remember, the story is what you make it. and if you dont like this way, go and do whatever you want. that is the beauty of skyrim.",83.3
"an awesome game, good graphics and awesome battles",355.9

"i spent years saying that mass effect was the best game i had ever played. until i played skyrim. i seriously hope this also continues in the single player realm instead of becoming the next wow with the elder scrolls online. i want an elder scrolls vi, vii, viii, and as many as we can get. please!",104.0
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a fantastic rpg, possibly the best of its kind. stunning graphics, an actual storyline which you bother to look at, great gameplay and sooo much stuff to do. it might have glitches - some, more annoying than others - and the guards might make you want to kill something, but it is still fantastic. if you like rpgs and you have not tried skyrim, shame on you. shame. on. you. the verdict: 9/10 + stunning graphics, brutal combat, and a storyline that actually makes you want to kill this dude. - annoying glitches, it ruined my life i play it so much.",134.7
"i managed to leave this game when i finished the main quest. i spent only like a 100 hours on it. that was a torrent download. i was so proud of myself because everyone else was spending thousands of hours on this game. i thought they were stupid. i knew they were stupid. then i bought this game on a sale on steam in september 2014. its 2029 and im still playing this game. i am stupid. 10/10",1.5

"just an awesome game with lots of capability. you can mod it to africa and this game will provide endless entertainment. if you liked the other elder scrolls or fallout, or rpgs this game is for you.",40.8
"if you like hacking and slashing your way through an adventure of walking and running and travelling across a mass space of land full of things for you to do, this is for you. lol. but seriously, a nice rpg to go back to once in a while even after youre done with the storyline because of all the mods.",108.5
"start game. quit game. intall 50 mods and an enb. game crashes. fix crash, then install more mods until it crashes again. rinse and repeat. 10/10",24.3
"no matter how long this game has been out, i can always pick it up and spend hours playing it. it never gets old, and now that i have it on pc its even better. exploring skyrim with the fan made mods from the steam workshop makes it a whole new game!",68.8

"if you have the patience, time and electric then skyrim is one rpg worthy of dropping in on. it is massive, it will take you a whole lot of time building your characters stats and also collecting a whole lot of stuff to use on enemies. overall if you wanted a singleplayer experience that is gonna take a whole lot of time to complete everything then skyrim is one of the best in its genre.",252.8
"it is not often i get lost in a game like i did with skyrim. everything about this game screams quality and adventure. while bethesda hasnt exactly got a track record for delivering bug-free games at launch, this has been a pleasant, polished and amazing experience so far. a much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system thats amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do. truly a masterpiece.",154.9
"such an awesome game, you can play this for hours on end and still have things left to do. massive lands to explore and lots of quests at every turn. definitely reccomended, especially for the hard-core completionists. there are a few issues however - the game feels poorly optimized and doesnt work perfectly across a triple monitor setup. the gui can become a bit streched and awkward. there are third party fized for this however, and the modding community for the game is amazing. additionally, if you have a high end computer, there is a free dlc available for higher resolution textures. overall, this game has given me hours of endless gameplay that were simply fantastic.",151.9
"the game that makes you emerge to a universe of rpg stories to make you stuck for months and you will come back for it every now and then for your rpg needs. community is great with alot of updates and mods for you ro customise the game as you please. the graphic is breathtaking as for the music it make you forget about the time around you and everything you should have done that day and still it is worth it! if you have the time and energy for it then its a must buy!",151.5

"this game is relatively meh. theyve managed to dumb this series down to something that can bore me in a few hours. hint: only put points into the strength/health/carry weight/armor/toughness/everything stat. being a magician is worthless. every play through you should be a sneaky melee character that can use a bow. also enjoy fighting nothing but the same bear over and over.",94.3
"it delivers. i recommend getting some of the texture packs though. remember, this game was made for consoles; so the graphics are console-grade. oh, and by the way. ...one does not simple do the main quest in skyrim.",204.6

"skyrim has to be one of the most epic (and i mean that in large proportions as well as completely awesome) games that i have ever played. there is a deep sense of immersion to be found, hours upon hours of gameplay (especially if you create multiple characters) and a near endless supply of awesome mods to keep you going. only things i dont like: buggy as ill get out, although not unplayably so. just ask someone about the horses. dragon combat is a bit lacking the sneak skill is freaking broken you can one shot bosses if you arent on the harder difficulties lets fight even more dragur! also, please get a dlc, at least one, and hearthfire doesnt count. they are both good, get one, get both, heck get legendary edition if you want and have them all, but please get one of them. they add so much to the game. all in all, id say 9/10. great game :d",607.7

"a wonderful example of an rpg, with excellent graphics and story. and amazing side quests; ive never done so many in any other game before. it has hidden paths that are extremely fun to find and follow, all over the world. very fun to play, the first time. but after that, at least for me, there wasnt a whole lot of replay-ability. there isnt much to draw you in again once you have completed the game. still, a wonderful game.",59.9

(what-if) need breathing suit to survive distance?), nature should do damage if wearing less than accurate clothing?, if flying? areas built to fly to, if space? suit to reach/way to reach/ reason/new places to tread), some quests were forced (shouldnt be), needed more craft than offered?(to use all the bones, ore, miscellanous collected goods.), whatever missed.",208.7

"bethesda is by far one of my favorite developers. skyrim has been one of my favorite rpgs in a long time. the story is deep, gameplay is rich, and the environment is simply stunning. i played originally on xbox 360 but find the pc version to look so much better and plays a lot better as well. it is not as deep as older rpgs in the leveling system but offers a very fresh take on character customization. if you are familiar with any of their other games in the last few years (i.e. fallout 3/nv or oblivion) then it will feel very familiar. you can easily lose hours (or days...) in this game without even realizing it. the game is very immersive and has a lot of replayability. i have yet to get bored in the world of skyrim. if you are a fan of the fantasy rpg genre and have played any of bethesdas other games then this is a must have for any gamers collection.",16.8

"not just one of the best elder scrolls games of all time, but one of the best and most expansive single player rpgs ever made. 2014, years later, the graphics still hold their own and the game is a marvel to behold. it can be a bit frustrating simply being thrown into this large sandbox, and some may feel lost and undirected in this vast landscape, but the journal and compass will guide you to victory. magic is a bit less potent thant it should be at high levels, and all weapons (bows, swords, axes, hammers, one or two handed) when combined with smithing and enchanting are a bit overpowered. in the end though, you will come to love this corner of tamriel, it is the ultirmate adventure rpg, enough said. stop reading this review, go get tes v skyrim. let me also reccomend a bunch of smim packs for better graphics and frostfall, as well as imps more complex needs if you want to eat/sleep/freeze.",48.2

"a amazing game where you are totaly free to kill monsters, do quests, make armor, and lots of more! you have a lot of levels to reach and unlock new skills, earn more health stamma or magic. the character which is dragonborn is a amazing thing. he can learn shouts which does really good damage on monster or animals. the dlcs dragonborn, heartfire and dawnguard is the best experianse of the skyrim gameplay. dragonborn where you can tame dragons and ride them. hearthfire where you can make a house and lot of more. dawnguard where you can become a vampire do a lot of more quest and have lots of fun. it can be difficult but thats just in the start. once you have reached more levels the game will be the best thing in your life. you cant stop playing this game. i recomend this game 8/10 without any dlcs but i recomend the game 10/10 with the legendary edition.",113.6

"if youve played previous elder scrolls games, glitches and oddities dont come as a surprise. nevertheless, skyrim feature tighter combat, fewer bugs, improved graphics and so on. if there is anything to complain about in this game, it would be the user interface, inventory taking up a lot of useless items, some bad acting, as you level up, the creatures you fight take forever to kill by hitting them 30-40 times, and finally its replayability value. creating characters is nice (even though it takes a very long time to get what you want done). finding and completing quests is solid. i said all i disliked. the game succeeds in comparison to elder scrolls iv, and i am addicted to this game like a... person... playing games! replayability value is hard to get back to though if you leave the game for a month or more. anyways, great work on the game, this is more than i expected it to be with little to no struggle to get used to. postives: +tons of content +fun combat +huge open world to explore +modding tools +deep character creation tools +a lot of side missions and long/endless gameplay +a lot of ways to improve graphics negatives: bug-free horrible voice acting poor character animations overall: 9/10",150.2

"amazing game. 80+ hours into the game and still have a ton of quests to do, places to explore and dragons to kill, lol. pc community has been awesome and even without the creation kit, there are some amazingly good mods already available if you look around. ive pushed the games limits on graphics up to max and while nice, ive found the high res graphics and enhanced audio mods to be a very cool upgrade that puts me inside an amazingly immersive enviornment. the crack of thunder during a storm, the rushing water coming down a waterfall and foaming as it breaks over rocks as it streams away. while i do have to say the controls take a bit of getting used to, once theyre mastered, combat and exploration are loads of fun. overall, on a personal level, this is one of very few games that scores a 10/10 with me. yes there are a few minor probs but they are countered by such a huge number of great aspects that in the end i can discount them. from this point on, it only gets better!",131.6
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"its skyrim. another game in the elder scrolls series with the previous title being oblivion, lets just say ive played this game over 3 times and still enjoy it. in fact its my favorite rpg series with fallout being close behind. so i definitely recommend skyrim to any rpg fan.",123.1
"this game is the best game that i have ever played. there are so many things to do, so many places to explore! i dont think ive ever seen another game that has graphics like this one! exept for dino hoard. .-. this game is a good game and i think you guys should get it! :d",58.9
"the ing game did not even ing work at all like everything about the ing game sucks so much damn . steam sucks for  for habing me buy the game and not even ing work steam you will be hearing from me until i ge a ing refund or thier asses handed to them with thier  in thier mouths little   mother ers fix the ing damn game before i fix a good  whooping!",296.5
"you ought to love this game and its beautiful graphics. the story is complex and interesting. the journey pulls you into this gorgeous world of dragons and mythical creatures. moreover, the landscape is simply breathtaking!!",253.3
"great game wish i wasnt so late in starting it. i also wish there was a coop mode for it. i think it would be a great multiplayer game.",8.0
"this game is great for people who love adventures, looting, and being able to stab someone!",60.6
"skyrim holds many adventures, and amazing gameplay. i only wish it would last longer.",62.6
"probably one of the most epic games in existence. you can literally wonder around for hours without touching the main story but instead explore caves and temples and such. 87 hours well spent (and thats under a single playthrough!). i regret nothing!",87.2
"almost 90 hours in and still havnt finished the main storyline...so much to do...",105.7
"i think skyrim is a very good open world rpg great character customization and amazing world. physics could better, but in there difference it does make for some good laughs. just and overall good rpg game it portrays the fantasy world very well with having the ability to create any class you could choose ; things such as a heavy mage, or a robed warrior these are all classes that you get to make yourself no set classes like other rpg. its a fun time killer and there are a ton of side missions to keep this game going for very long. you will build up hours of fun with this game.",47.4
"skyrim is a must if you have any enjoyment in fantasy rpg style games. with a choice of first person or third person views. the crafting is simple to learn and can make more powerful weapons than dropped which makes it worth the effort. the combat is fast and fun. the detail to the game is amazing, i was a little disappointed that some technology was ignored such as directx 11, eyefinity / surround support and 3d was fair. the world is huge, the expansions fun and the community of designers that make add on content huge with some great contributions.",354.5
"best game ever i just wish it wasnt so hard 2 move my head it has set me back & made me die alot",96.1
"this game is great! it also has a nice modding community.",74.8
"skyrim is an open world action/adventure game. you can climb the tallest mountains (to a certain point then you cant go any further up), swim across massive lakes, fight dragons, explore dungeons, kill anyone(some poeple just faint then get back up). basically you are free to do whatever you want, but what you choose to do affects what will happen. can you forge armor? make weapons?? you bet you can! personally i think it is one of the best games ive ever played! i highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!",92.9
"open world dungeons-and-dragons-style adventure game. play in first or third person. make a lizard man that shots lightening out of his finger tips and marry gay cat man. fight dragons that look like the macho man randy savage while dressed as iron man, riding your fluttershy pony. the guitar playing bear sings of your great deeds. if you dont enjoy the idea of hack-n-slash first (or 3rd) person games, then the add-ons (free and seemlessly downloaded directly from steam so so easily) are worth a looky loo. buy it on sale (since its on sale almost every 2 weeks),",675.8
"i really freaking love skyrim! i love this game because it is beautiful, humorous, fun to play and simply amazing! also, you can use the game with/without mods and you still wont get bored! i love the fact that you can create your character to be what you want them to be, make them get better at certian things. id reccomend this to anyone who enjoys medievil/fantasy rpg games.",83.2
"great game. i have it on both my ps3 and on steam.",24.6
"great game i have bought it 3 times on xbox, 1 on ps3 and now on pc.",4.6
"really great game. the elder scrolls are amazing to start with and then the modding support really make this game future proof. would buy on sale or not, get the dlcs its all gravy baby!",325.9
"best game out there. this game is my all time favorite",175.7
"if you dont have this game, youre a dickless man.",667.5
"much better on pc than on any console. loads much quicker and you can use mods and console commands. fantastic game.",53.4
"of course i do. i just built a sick pc so playing it on ultra high makes it really amazing!",32.9
"skyrim is a fun open world game with great game mechanics, but it lacks a little bit of variety with there being a limited amount of weapons and characters",25.9
"amazing! a huge leap forward for the elder scrolls series! beautiful graphics & a vastly improved levelling system!",248.8
"the best open world rpg, no doubt about it. if you like the genre, this is must have.",178.2
"if you dont own and love this game then you are no #timelordpalofmine",90.0

"buy game pirate dlc install mods reinstall game when mods dont work properly do it again over and over welcome to bethesda games",309.0
"this game is rather dull, grey colors, honestly it feels like they are flaunting the fact that it has dragons. the level up systems feels kinda dull and there isnt much to it, making the characters feel very cut and paste, along with not having much filling the world. i would advise anyone get morrowind or oblivion rather than play this.",85.5
"its ing skyrim. you already know if you like it or not. personally, i liked it.",122.6
"i love this game so much the gameplay is great, the only ploblem is that it continues to force close on my computer... thinking its just a glitch in the system because my computer doesnt show any signs of struggle while running the game.",309.0
"you can never get enough for this game, highly recommend for those role player you can write your own story every time you play new character!",261.3
"oh god, this game has consumed my life. there was this one time when playing at night, i played til the birds started chirping outside my room.... lets just say that i blame my fiance for moding the game to the point that i feel like im that sexy bad  dark elf that snipes bandits and monsters from afar. and yes this dark elf has a nice rack that likse to strip bandits of their skimmies, and take screen shots of random crap that goes around after she kills animals. i give it a bazillion skoomi",143.2

"stole a plate and got killed next time i misclicked, still got killed 14/12 would listen to darude sandstorm again!",60.4
"this is such a cool game. you can do so much, it feels like you want to play it forever, which i think of. from a looking like a citizen to a fierce warrior, a wizard, a sneaky archer, or you can be all of those things at once! hey bethsda, i think this is your best game.",235.5
"i yelled at a cow and it died, then punched a chicken and suddenly the entire town was trying to kill me, later i rode a horse off a cliff, killing the horse and i thought myself too until i stood up and brushed the dirt from my pants. after that, i punched a moose in the balls and it died, so that was a thing. then i fought a dragon that tokyo-drifted into the side of a cliff. afterward, i shouted at a goat and it fell down the mountain like something out of goat simulator. all in all, 12/10 would dickpunch livestock again.",121.5
"in my humble opinion this is the mother of all fantasy rpg games. i have spent more hours of my life on this game than any other game ever. ive also never created so many different characters in a single game before. ive lost count how many times ive started a new character to try to come up with a new archetype. its insane. the base game itself, without dlcs or mods is alone, well worth any gamers time. then when you add dlcs and (especially) mods, the game becomes even that much better. this is my single favorite video game of all time. highly, highly suggest it to anyone and everyone.",231.0
"i fus ro downloaded this awesome game. adding some fun mods so i am hunting evil wicked my little ponies!",60.9
"without mods id give it maybe 5/10. combat is simplistic, the roleplaying is very light, and the game isnt too challenging. with mods id give it 9/10. since modding allows greater control to custom tailor your experience, i would highly recommend it to any player. personally recommended must-haves are frostfall and requiem.",354.0
"just bought this game on sale for $4.99 gotta say it pays to have steam!",11.3
"this game is very fun! i have always liked it on consoles and have beaten it on there, but i bought it on pc for the summer sale. you can do much more on the pc, it doesnt take forever to load, it looks prettier, and you can run mods on it. this game is a great rpg and is worth the money. (i would get it before the steam sale is over for a simply 5 usd)",34.2
"this is probably my favorite game of all time. endless hours of fun as the dragonborn, maybe an unhealthy amount in my case but still. the one game i can play over and over again without growing bored of it. endless paths to choose, endless areas to explore and dungeons to conquer. i fully recommend this game.",263.7
"if anyone wouldnt recommend this game... their a boring person",260.4

"you will not be seen by your friends and family for weeks, be sure to warn them before starting this game so they dont assume you have died.",203.5
"best single player game i have ever played. own it on console aswell and have easly put in over 1000 hrs into this game. 10/10",9.6
"skyrim is your home away from home. as you start your journey as dragonborn from escaping execution you make many choices and as said in fable. with every choice, a consequence. and this game delivers. you craft your own story. you make your own adventure. fighting in whatever fancies you. from amazing sword fights. to playing dodgeball with fireballs with your dark elf mage. you craft your own story in this amazing world. and it is truly a ride worth hanging on to. and incase you havent noticed yet even though this game is two years old it still deserves a 11/10",85.5
"quite possibly my favorite game of all time. recommend this game to anyone.",418.6
"one of the best games you can get! its so fun with many different quests and activities. you can join groups like the guild, brotherhood and more! and if you get bored theres so many workshop items you can get to enhance the fun! also great dlc.",134.9

"this is the game thats so fun an addicting, that i bought it day of release on xbox 360, played it for three years, then quit xbox for pc, missed skyrim, bought legendary addition, and now playing it nonstop. this game is an all time best rpg only being beaten by oblivion and morrowind (which i also spent money on the dlcs on xbox and then bought on pc with all dlc)",43.2
"skyrim has got to be one of the best rpgs ever! there are bugs and the visuals are not mind blowing but this was originally developed for consol so as always, it was gimped from the start but thanks to an epic modding community on here and the nexus, you can have an incredible looking game world without the bugs. i totally recommend skyrim to anyone who likes rpgs with swords, shields and bows!",355.2
"easier for me to play with a usb xbox controller than my mouse. mouse has terrible sensitivity. but anyways. fantastic game. already knew how to play from watching others play a lot. look forward to logging more hours on it.",7.3
"it will get you addicted. hours of gameplay which is so fun to play.",32.1
"incredible. no other way to put it. modding is amazing and vanilla is quite good. basicly just incredible.",17.0
"i spend way too much time playing this game. between console and pc, i have wasted months. well, not wasted. fun isnt waste. the main thing i like about this, and elder scrolls games in general, is the sheer amount of personalization you can do, especially when you include mods. the game is truly something you can make your own. when i get tired of my other games, i always come back to skyrim. whether playing a mage, a warrior, or something in between, i am sure to find content i never noticed before.",780.7
"its skyrim..... thats all you need to know. forget your friends! come play lol",228.0

"this is a great game. and the mods for it can leave you speachless sometimes",90.7
"one of the biggest and best games ive ever played. a huge open world that lets you do whatever you want whenever you want. you could go and do the main quest or ignore it and join the dark brotherhood. sure you could do this in other elder scrolls games, but skyrims world was the one that pulled me in the most. also slaying dragons is a ton of fun. even doing small fetch quests would keep you in. everytime i play this in this amazing world every time i check the time a hour passes. this game is most certainly worth $20. or you could also get the legendary edition which is also worth every penny.",328.8
"one of the best open world games ive ever played. theres simply so much to do and the graphics are fantastic. there are plenty of ways to customize your character, though the inventory system could admittedly use a little work. if you enjoy games like fallout 3, then youd do well to pick this up.",184.3
"do you like going outside? then youll hate this game 10/10",23.5

"terrible console port to pc. dumbed down for the masses. boring cookie-cutter quests. claustrophobic fov on pc.",4.9
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"this game has controled countless hours of my life, on steam it may say i dont have many, but on the xbox i have over 10,000 played and i just cant stop playing this game. skyrim is a very well made and addicting game that makes the player think about if he wants to check that room, or if he wants to eat that tomato 0_0 many people play this game for fun but its part of my life and i really like enjoy it. so many places to go and things to do which makes countless hours of fun..15/10 one of the best!!",67.2

"like any other game that allows you to put in cheats, an mods. its a great game for the sole reason of that. id recommend buying it. though recommendations for games like these mainstream arent very neccesarily due to the wide variety of gameplay videos created on youtube.",14.4
"skyrim is a great game. i recomend this to everybody.",59.3
"bearing down on 600 hours of this game, and its still a fun, fresh experience. skyrim was a substantial improvement over morrowind and oblivion. the races are all very viable choices for the game. while you lost the ability to customize spells from the previous game, you dont really miss them. crafting is a welcome addition to the game, as well. and eliminating the class system has substantially improved the game: no more having to powerlevel acrobatics, or becoming useless because you mastered athletics to the detriment of all skills. on the downside, there are a few weird bugs, but nothing terribly game-breaking. additionally, your inventory can get cluttered, probably because the inventory system was really designed for the console. not a big deal, just inconvenient. all in all, i highly recommend this game. if you like sandboxes, you will not be disappointed.",639.7
"if you havent played this game, i feel sorry for you.",69.2
"this game is the climax of role playing and adventure. with mods it is the greatest game ever made. no joke.",57.0
"great game though the command codes can make or break the game for you though. be sure to go to the workshop there is a lot of great additions to the game to improve the overall experience of this game. this is a classic and i can see my self playing this game for a very long time.",47.8
"i would play the game, if it wasnt so evil. its a shame because its probably the best garme like it i have ever seen. the combat game mechanics were fantastic, especially the archey, maybe a little easy but extremely fun. i found the dungeons a little less rewarding than oblivion, they all seemed alot more ..... predictable, following the same basic pattern of design from the developers. for example if your 4 levels deep into a particular dungeon, you might not see an exit shortcut cave somewhere, but you will know its there, because the last 20 you been to all had them, convenient maybe, realistic, no. as a player with morales, i tried to avoid the evil in this game, but its different so say ..... star wars, because in that you get a choice. in this game they kinda force you to do evil things through the lineier and locked line of main questing. also, i had no interest in magic as a dedicated archer, but was also forced into taking those dragon crys that are essential for the main quests. just went a little overboard i think with the evil, apart from that, a very good game, but unfortunatly i wouldnt reccomend this to friends.",0.2
"make sure u download the fetish mods, they make the game much more enjoyable",75.0
"much better than morrowind, and the mods for it are out of this world",3.1
"this is quite simply a fantastic game. bit late to the party to say that though, but that changes nothing.",19.4
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best single rpgs of its generation. the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is fluid and unique, the world is huge, there are hundreds of quests to keep you busy, and thousands of beasts to slay! plus, theres dragons! freaking dragons! what more could you want in a game?",100.7
"the main game is great, not to mention the mods. one gigantic thumbs up!",142.3
"go buy this game. seriously. now. do it. now. do it. do. it. do it.",174.9
"first off, its a great game, it would be stupid to deny it, but if youve had some issues with morrowind and oblivion (and even fallout 3), they havent been fixed. the animations are still awkward, the combat ai is stiil fight or flee, without any variation or tactics needed. i dont care about the main story as its a sandbox, but the dialog is abysmal. the balance later in the game crawls into a hole and dies, making the game quite dull the farther you get. and as with any bethesda title, there are bugs everywhere. but its still fun to play and when the community starts churning out mods, its gonna be amazing. as someone who hated oblivion before it was cool to hate it, i say i had fun with skyrim. get it when its on sale.",130.3
"hundreds of hours of fun! i found that the elder scrolls v skyrim, has tons of content, and then i found the dlc content, and found there was even more! you will be slaying dragons, completing quests, casting magics and slaying bears and enemy soldiers with your sword and sheild, in your orcish armour, or even dragon scale or plate armour, for hours on end! excellent graphics for its time, with mods, out to help boost graphics and overall immersion. this is a game for all, whether you be 10 years old, or 60 years old. i highly recommend this game.",253.5
"so, ive logged almost 300 hours into this game and i still havent 100% completed it. its extremely entertaining, and i heartily recommend it. the music is beautiful, the story compelling, the world is enrapturing. the important thing to realize however is that this game is best played with mods from the steam community equipped to make the scenery more beautiful, make the game itself less buggy, and make the user interface more streamlined. theres a vast array of mods allowing you to do pretty much anything you want in this game, so please use them.",447.1
"ive played about 70 hours now and im probably less then 1/4 of the way through the game. this is one of the best games i have ever played, and i was never a fan of the other elder scrolls. i have had multiple boss fights that have took me upwards to 15 to 20 even possibly 30 minutes, and i never felt frustrated but i did feel challenged. this is one game that a 60 dollar price tag is actually under-priced.",417.1
"the old rolled papers the fifth: sky in dis game. you smel stufs and things",11.6
"i am usually a man of words, but this game is beyond mere descriptions i can give. the preplexities of emotions in a beatiful symphony that it radiates is more than i can explain, it redefines immerision. its more than just a fictional part of life, no, this game is real and its alive. the final part in the elder scrolls is a great ending to an amazing saga, bethesda really made this game their last, and it was one hell of a finale. it all sounds very cliche, but it is a part of your life youll need to experience. highly recommend this to anyone.",827.7
"if you have never played/owned this game in the time its been out. then you have not lived. buy this game its amazing.",94.8
"no gnu/linux support. mods via steam workshop are heavily censored. sidequests are very boring. story is over with too quickly. visuals are alright. id play it a bit more and post a fuller review if it was playable on an os that respects my freedom.",44.4

"if any game deserves to be a game you own, skyrim is that game. goty, my favourite game ever.",79.9
"being the second most played game on my account, and probably about to be the most played, this game is one of the best ive ever played. it came out a couple years ago but it still looks and feels better than most games that come out today. 100/10",415.9
"skyrim is the latest addition to the elder scrolls serie and it is stands triumphant on the smoldering remains of a dragon looking down on its smaller and amazed siblings. a great game, all in all. totally recommend this to friends. now buy it. damnit. now.",56.9
"this game, while not in the same league as morrowind, still manages to be an excellent rpg experience. granted, some rpg elements are toned down to the casual player but thats not always a bad thing, it manages to grant you enjoyment when you level your individial skills, long gone are the days when you get frustrated by the horrible leveling system in oblivion, you no longer get weaker if you dont level in a specific way (mandatory max endurance as fast as possible for example). the modding community will keep things interesting when you finish the original way.",186.8
"this is one of the buggiest, most broken, most unfinished-feeling games i have seen in a long time. it would take a very special game to make me look past all the (really glaring) issues and still have fun, and skyrim is one of those games. it captures the feeling of adventure, of exploration, of excitement over the smallest things, more than most any games ive ever played. wouldnt call it a masterpiece, but its most definitely worth your time and money. (plus the game is extremely moddable, so youre getting a potentially limitless amount of playthroughs without it feeling stale, not even mentioning the entirely new games people have made with the engine. bumps up the value quite considerably, in my opinion.)",144.1
"well what to say about this game that hasnt been said a million times? i still love it after 3 years and making all achievments on 3 platforms. any one thinking of trying this at the new low prices should just do it. massive world, 100 hours of game play with side quests, immersive cahracters and areas. the ease of using a xbox360 controller for input on the computer was just the perfect bonus. 9.5 outta 10 personal stars :)",263.5
"this game is truly amazing! the story and lore are very rich in content and has been well developed. at every turn i find amazing views and more enemies to fight, leveling my character to get amazing powers and abilities along the way. this game is a truly rich and fulfilling experience, and is worth every penny!",106.7

"this game is magnificent. it grows upon the success that was oblivion in a great way. almost everything has been improved in some way. the graphics are better, and it all around feels like youre there. besides the occasional hilarious looking glitch (ex: my follower swimming through air, i almost pissed myself laughing) the only other problem i have is that the master volume is way too low. i have to turn up my volume to the point where the game is now audible, but steam messages are deafening. most other glitches are quite typical with bethesda games however. i completely reccommend this game. if you enjoyed previous elder scrolls games, youll love this. if youre new, the story might be a bit more confusing, but not that hard to pick up. my score: 9.5/10 - not perfect, but damn near close.",108.2

"very good game. while the story may not be as good as in previous elder scrolls games, its still a epic game. the fact that you play as a dragonborn is a nice change, which brings me to the shouts. they were a very good addition to the game, and they can be pretty fun, for example unrelenting force (a.k.a. the popular fus ro dah). graphics wise, its not the best there is in terms of textures (theres also shadow striping in some spots), but graphics arent always the main priority of a game. there are bugs, and stuff that should have been in the game, but the dlcs add extra questlines and content which are really great (my favorite is dragonborn, but you may have different opinions). dragonborn and dawnguard add extra questlines and places, and hearthfire gives you the ability to build your own home in 3 places. even so, if you want the game to be perfect, then get the mods you want and your experience will be very great. score: 9/10 (by itself) 9.4/10 (with dlc) 10/10 (with dlc and mods)",147.6

"a good sandbox game held back from being great by clinging onto its elder scrolls baggage---and buggy engine. there is much to do even without mods, but the buggy, buggy engine sometimes wrecks things in a most-unfun way. that and the combat feels a bit clunky---fighting moving enemies in melee is awkward. bethesda could learn some game design tips from the saints row games, methinks. still a good game, but i would recommend waiting for a deep sale on it.",144.6
"best game ever, story is kinda short, but there are so much other quest that are just mint. mods for this game are just great, with rigth mods game looks completly difrent.",74.6
"nearly 200 hours in, i will recommend skyrim. this is, to date and probably for a long time, the best game i have ever played. its as simple as that. theres just nothing in the world with comparable content, narrative, and customizable play style at the same time. this isnt a masterpiece, it is the masterpiece, and it is only getting better with mods and the promise of future expansion packs and other updates. just be prepared to give up $60 and more time than youre probably ready to give up on a video game.",498.8
"hands down this is my favorite adventure/rpg ive ever played. being highly customizable with community mods is what keeps me coming back to this gem. the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is top notch. just like when purchasing a car, i judge games i play on how they feel. when i play this game, i can get lost in its world for hours at a time. while the gameworld itself has vast depth, the story itself is lackluster. bethesda has a habit of making interesting and deep worlds, but shallow characters and storylines. if they could master how to make characters feel real and like your character is part of an unfolding story, rather than the centerpiece by which the world revolves around, i would probably quit my job and play their games without eating, drinking, and/or defacating. myself and my couch would become one and together we would rule tamriel together.",558.9

"i had this game before on my xbox 360, and loved it. as soon as the winter sale came out, i got it. this isnt because its not worth the money, but im a bit poor. but besides that, the series of the elder scrolls always had kept me intrigued and excited, not to mention the mods you can download give a whole new experience. only con i can think of is the over exaggerated ragdolls and the repetetiveness occasionally. over all, the game is well made, and well thought out. i suggest you play once or twice more after your first playthrough, doing all the side missions and trying out the major classes.

"important: do yourself a favor and buy the legendary version of skyrim instead. there are a lot of good mods that require all the dlcs and it would be a shame if you wouldnt be able to use it because you dont have the dlcs. the legendary edition is definitely worth it especially during sales. alone without mods? its one of those games that you pick up and enjoy, get tired of, and then never come back to. with mods? all of a sudden, this game has become an easy candidate for the best game of all time. you will be able to tweak whatever gameplay settings that bothered you from the original game. you can have new buildings/characters/weapons/quests from mods without having to buy dlc. you can change the entire landscape of skyrim with graphical enhancements. oblivion and morrowind simply cannot compare to this game in the mods department. i used a lot of lord of the rings weapons mods, as well as some star wars mods. if you have a good computer, there are lots of graphic overhauls.",41.5
"been play this since 2011 if you dont have this game your nuts",1194.6
"since its pre-alpha release in november 2011, this game has know so many updates (mysteriously called mods) that it sometimes get unplayable. still worth a few hours of good casual enjoyment.",143.6
"this review was written as response to the question if it was worth it to pick the legendary edition: i recently bought the legendary version for the pc because i knew i would eventually buy the dlcs, since i already have 500+ hours on skyrim in the ps3. the main game is pure awesomeness, but in my opinion the best missions in skyrim come from the dragonborn dlc (well dont disregard the fact that with this dlc you can ride dragons) and the dawnguard dlc adds a lot of content for something that looked a bit vage in the main game (werewolfs and vampires). last but not least with hearthfire you can actually build your house not just buy one, but what makes this dlc awesome is the fact that you can adopt kids (it may appear dumb in a game like skyrim but after a while you actually form a bond with the child). so yeah i think its worth picking the legendary edition. tl;dr: buy the legendary edition you wont regret it.",12.1

"tons of fun, i love the elder scrolls series, and its a good addition to it",66.1
"ahh, the elder scrolls v: skyrim. this game is one of the best games i can think of, and is even better than the elder scrolls iv: oblivion (i never played morrowind or daggerfall, or the spinoff games). it is a great addition to the series, and exceeds my expectations. the exploration, the combat, the adventure this game holds is unbelieveable. it seems every time a new elder scrolls game comes out, it always sets the bar for other rpg games to follow. thats how good they are. they always get better, without rehashing the same game over and over. it has a great storyline, and a grand map to explore. this game never ends, and never dies.",318.7

"its interesting for as long as the story takes place but afterwards you are left with a empty world with various quests that doesnt change the world or how anyone in the world looks at you. in short its a nice adventure but dont expect it to be an alternate world you can escape to.",111.0
"skyrim is a good game all around with the main quest and all the side quests. but if you want a better game with more armor and weapons and make skyrim seem like a survival game, mod it! frostfall, immersive armors and weapons, enhanced blood are just a few mods that make the game better!",26.2

"absolutely amazing......the story lines are solid, the game immerses you in a world where you really do feel like the dragonborn... when you level up on character perks youll find yourself in a position where youll struggle to choose because there are so many options...the landscape and biomes are very well done as well as the voiceovers and combat... playing it in 3d is amazing however the shadowing needs work... the replayability is excellent, youll be playing this one for years....if you are thinking about buying it...just buy it.....10/10",245.3
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"i highly recomend this game to people that like open-world/roleplay games. the game is very unique because you get alot of weapons (bows, swords, axes) and also..... magic. you might think its the kind of cheesy magic, but no, no, no, no. im talking, powerfull shouts that can make your enemy fly away, fireballs, lightning and ice comming out of your hand! anyway... there is a very cool story line, and if you complet that, you get hundreds of side-quests to do and most give you specific itmes. so... hope this gives you a good idea about the game and hope you get it.",99.5
"amazing game , with many quests and a huge world to explore. as a fan of elder scrolls series, i higly recommend this one !!",189.2
"i highly recommend geting this game because it lets you make your character and make your adventure, its not like one of those game where your forced to play as a certain character and play the same story over and over, its lets you do what ever you want to do with no rush.",176.1

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a truly excellent game and with the right mods it can quickly become one of the most immersive. the modding community for skyrim is now so vast that the ways to enjoy your game are endless. however if you dont want mods then i would still recomend the vanilla game to people who enjoy fantasy and rpg games. skyrims open world map is great as if you dont want to do any quests you can just pick any direction and begin exploring and adventuring as you see fit. there are also many different play styles, with 10 races to choose from and even more skill trees to explore (18 to be precise) you can pretty much do anything! overall i highly recommend this game, and all of the dlc! 100% recomend it, 10/10 game.",421.3

"yes, i highly recommend this game to any and all peoples. looks really nice, for not being a 2014 game. good storytelling, even if its the worlds about to end we need a savior cliche. nothing is cooler than killing a dragon. you get the theme goin (great soundtrack), theres a dragon above head, and youre just whackin it with a sword and absorbin its soul. delicious, scrumptious soul.",103.9

"it will consume your whole life and you wont even mind. the environments are all unique, the possiblities for gameplay are endless, and there are dragons. also, you have an amazing amount of freedom to do whatever you want, both in quests and in how to level up your character. i played it on xbox360 obsessively and loved it enough to pick it up on steam for a second playthrough.",22.6

"so i started my latest game of skyrim with the aim to try every single type of combat, try smithing, enchanting, alchemy and as many quests as i could find. i was going to absorb everything this game had to offer. then my girlfriend got involved.... she decided she liked this game full of dragons, magic, swords and being a badass who could destroy it all. i was hopeful that i had finally found a game we could both play and talk about. nope. her idea of playing has become sitting on the second computer chair, browsing facebook and ordering me to kill people at random. i can no longer enter any of the cities without being molestered by several angry guards and im pretty sure i have lost a lot of minor quest characters. this game no longer has any meaning to me. i will play again when i have rid myself of my real world companion... so that i may return in peace to my skyrim ones",110.3

"oh boy, heres an interesting one. now this one is going to be hard to describe in a small paragraph. skyrim is a big sandbox game where you go around, killing dragons, bandits, and even guards. you choose whether or not youd like to be a good guy or a bad guy (though i prefer to stay neutral so i dont have to choose between the two). you can join the companions, become a werewolf, and be badass. or you can become an assassin for the dark brotherhood and totally kick some  while earning a fair amount of cash all together. like i said, i cant put it all into one paragraph. but if your computer can handle it, or you have a console (and like medieval/fantasy games) i highly recommend this game.",154.1

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"best rpg out currently. it will likely stay that way until fallout 4 is released.",672.0
"i could go on and on about the things they didnt exactly do right, so ill say the fact: oblivion was better than skyrim morrowind was better than oblivion. it really feels like they are dumbing down the series with each es they make morrowind felt like the hardcore rpg that should be how they should be made no quest markers, no stealing indicator, no stealth indicator, monsters followed rules of logic, (ghosts cant be harmed by normal weapons ect.) you actually had to depend on your skils and wit, where as skyrim the general thought process consisted of run in and hit it till it dies which requires no thought obviously. so for skyrim it comes down to do you want hours of doing anything you can think of but at the cost of unchallenging fights? or do you want a game that makes you think before you fight and actually require prior planning?. overall would i reccomend it? no. though i will say the game is fun it just lacks the rpg elements of its elders and feels more hack and slash if anything.",164.8
"great role playing game with one of the biggest open worlds with solid graphics and game system. fantasy theme comes through strong with a lot of lore to discover. tons of exploration and adventuring giving you hundreds of hours of gameplay time. the expansions add even more lore and hours to your game time. you can mod the game for a better expierence if you desire.",54.2

"breathtaking immersion, wonderful graphics, and endlessly fun gameplay makes this game a prize to own. there are some problems with it, though. to start with, the immersion is so complete, youre disappointed when a feature isnt there, like when a character cant talk with you. secondly, the wonder that encompasses gameplay the first time round just isnt there in later saves, and this can be a huge loss for such an awe-inspiring game. however, if youre willing to try out mods, theres no end to the content you can find. the final issue is how combat and even other skills can become incredibly unbalanced in the latter part of the game. my answer to this is, once again, mods. the community has done an excellent job of rebalancing the game. and any of these slight problems pales in comparison to the wonder and glee that will fill you when you kill your first troll, or join the companions, or successfully evade a way-too-powerful-for-you dragon. this is one of the greatest games i own, no doubt about it.",312.9

"im not going to say that skyrim doesnt have problems, because it does. stealth is glitchy, there are a number of imperfect quests, plotholes, and every character seems to be voiced by the same three people. still, it does have a way of drawing you in, like most rpgs, but in a different way. the world is massive and holds secrets and new adventures at every turn. what it lacks in an interesting main questline, it makes up for in its side quests, factions, and lore. some of my fonder gaming memories come from skyrim, and if you have an affinity for roleplaying or just love to be part of a huge open world, this game will enthrall you and have you playing for hours.",169.6
"a great rpg featuring plenty of diverse places to explore and quests to do and skills to level up. honestly, im nearly 50 hours into this game and im not even close to completing the main storyline (at least i dont think so since it feels like i am still early in the story and ive never even finished the story before!). theres plenty of side quests to do, some short and others more in depth and probably shouldnt really be called side quests since they have their own story to them. these include other faction storylines or random lore that comes up with a long quest chain. its one of my top games of all time (gta san andreas on the ps2 is still my favorite of all time) for the open, endless-things-to-do world and just great presentation and production of the game. if youre into this you should definitely check out fallout 3, another one of my favorites by bethesda.",106.1
"such wow! very dragonborn! many arrow in the knee!",42.7
"gay... for 13 euro you have the legendary edition wich includes all dlc`s.. diden`t see that.. ><",21.6
"this game is just awesome. if you dont have it yet then go buy it foo!",284.8
"one of the best games ive played in a over a decade. combat system is fantastic. leveling/specialty system just right, not so complicated you have to restart if you spend a wrong talent but not so simple that it makes the game easymode. questing system has voice acting for all quests even the small ones rather than just walls of text which really helps to not make the quests feel like chores but actually fun gameplay. not to mention the main questline so far is very interesting, well organized lore and keeps you pushing to learn more. the environment in the game is beautiful and filled with little easter eggs here and there. like all games of this size though it has a few bugs, ive been getting crashes every now and then but theyve all been right after an autosave so i didnt lose progress. ive gotten stuck in some places and had to reload from a previous point, this however has caused a loss of progress. the last of the very few complaints is about the horses. you will end up buying a new horse frequently, even if you keep the horse away from battle it will usually find its way to you mid fight and dies very easily. seeing a giant toss a horse 200ft in the air is pretty amusing though. (normally it doesnt fly near that high but the giants are buggy.) all around excellent game, and i would give it a 9/10.",578.5
"i personally think that skyrim in its vanilla form is not a very good game. if you dont have the capacity on youre computer like i do to run a ton of mods, then this is more than likely not a very good purchase. console gamers got completely screwed over becuase of the lack of modability. however, put some mods into this game and it becomes a really fun experience.",226.8

"now dont be fooled that i only have a tiny bit of time invested in this game because that counter is a lie. this game is good enough that i have three saves, all level 50 or higher, on my xbox 360 and still was willing to buy it on steam. the emersion that i feel while playing this game is the deepest and most satisfying out of any of the hundreds of games i have tried. no matter how much i play this game there is always something to do, someone to meet, and a quest to finish. overall this is my second favorite game after dota 2, but unlike dota 2 i know why i love skyrim (see above).",29.0
"i dont always get an arrow in the knee.....but when i do i turn into a werewolf.",592.4
"this game is one of the best game released for the last generation, and also one of my favorites of all time. the fun you find there never ends with the tools and the big modding community that this game has. thats why its still one of the most played game according to the steam stats, even though its single player.",672.5

"ah, skyrim its been a long time now hasnt it. ok, so skyrim is my favorite game out of the what like six elder scrolls games. i love it so much and it runs pretty good on my laptop, so for that 10/10. even if it didnt run on my laptop it would still be 10/10 for a outstanding game!",32.8

"im not sure if any one reads this but if they do i want them to known that they did an amazing game the graphics are awesome and the interaction is so much ive necer seen anything like it. its amazing i love steam also i would like some help, i bought 7 days to die a few months ago and it doesent work... i was a bit sad and angry cause i spent thirty euros on the game and it would not work. whaiting for an anser.",21.7
"fantastic game, immersive first person experience rare in fantasy genre but almost expected in elder scrolls games at this point. would recommend to fans of the series or just anyone looking for a few hundred hours of fun!",326.5
"stealth and cunning, brawn and might, or intelligence and wizardry. you decide your character, your approach, your allegiance. become the dragonborn and make a name for yourself through adventure, questing, or any of the other lucious aspects in this installment of the elder scrolls series. this game takes place north of cyrodiil, the nation victim to the events of the oblivion gates 200 years ago. graphics: 10 gameplay:8 sounds:9 story:6. i was unimpressed, or rather uninterested in the dragons in skyrim, who occupy the main storyline. i prefer other side-quests like the contract killings for the dark brotherhood, thefts for the thieves guild, or really any other task a random citizen may give me. the first time i tried playing, i stuck mainly to the main story and dark brotherhood, i was bored within 8 hours of playing, not enough new or riveting topics. the second time however, i just let the wind take me wherever i may roam, and was much more pleased with 18 hours of gameplay. my advice? definitely get the game, but dont let the trails confine you, take the road less traveled and go in that cave, even if there is no quest involving it. recommend.",31.4
"everybody get this game now in legendary edition then download mods than play and it will be worth the $49.99 i love this game and just download mods for it all the time i also reccomend to download skyui after youe buy this. ok peace out",119.6

"amazing graphics, endless side quest offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and great voice acting, this game has so much in it",32.8
"theres not a whole heap to say when a game is this good, bethesda knows how to make a great open world rpg and skyrim is a masterclass of the form. an easy recommendation for those gamers who like to have their own adventure decided by themselves",290.9
"i have spent way, way too much time on this game, and i keep coming back to it to do more. at some point here i need to get around to finishing the main quest line. :)",157.0
"i just cant express how amazing, well-done and powerful this game is. it is just.. the best rpg i have ever played in my life. it is kinda addicted as well. moreover, it never ends and has an amazing story. even if you will get bored from it in far future , it has plenty of mods in the workshop that will make game even more fun. totally worth buying.. with all dlcs that it has. 10/10 ...",332.1
"this game is a mixture of excellent story, side quests and an amazing atmosphere which you can get only in skyrim. in addition to this - skyrim is also a continuation of the elder scrolls series. well done bethesda and thank you for this game. 10 out of 10",311.9

"any game where youve logged in excess of two working weeks in and still want to spend more time on is doing something right. i particularly love the soundtrack, and the hours and hours of incidental & background music that helps draw you in deeper.",122.1
"honestly one of the best open world actionrpgs of the past couple of years.",149.3
"now with over 150 hours on record i can wholeheartedly recommend this game. skyrim has almost everything i could have ever wanted from an action-rpg game, save for dialogue options, which can be overlooked in such a massive game. quests are mostly varied, although due to the size of the game some repetition is bound to occur. i have only now, after more than hundred hours of gameplay, begun to run out of quests, and i suspect there are still some to be discovered. skyrim, just as all the previous tes games, comes with a good selection of races, classes and playstyles, adding to the already great replay value from quest choices. regarding overall gameplay, i feel skyrim is a slightly casual experience as whole (at least within the rpg genre), being relatively easy with a short learning curve, but it blends action and awesome story writing together into a very attractive mix that nobody even slightly interested in fantasy adventure should miss. on top of all this, there is also a very active modding community, adding potentially hundreds more hours of gameplay.",385.3
"monster of content, but when will they re-do the physics?",60.1
"greatest game ever made in the world recommended to all!!!!!!!",43.6
"definitely an amazing game that can never get old. i decided to buy it for the pc after having played it a lot on the console, which was a great choice. for those deciding between regular skyrim and the legendary edition, legendary is certainly worth the extra dollars to get awesome dlcs like dawnguard.",140.5
"i just got skyrim i guess my friends wont be seeing me for a long tim",49.5

"have played this alot, but had it cracked until now (which is why my achievments are so wierd). the whole elder scrolls series is a masterpiece, feels so alive and is very immersive. the lore is great, the quests are great, the graphics are great and for the first time in a elder scrolls game: the combat is actually great! would highly recommend this except if you are searching for a competitive or online game.",35.7
"awesome! skyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim!",1126.2
"great game, definitely a must have for anyones library.",35.9
"i love this game. the world is huge and full of things to do and see. characters are varied and interesting. loot is satisfying. and the mods... my god. honestly, i couldnt enjoy skyrim in its vanilla state. the combat is boring for me, so got the ulitmate combat mod. that was the first mod i got. since then, ive got a whole lot more and theyve really improved the game a whole lot for me. vanilla skyrim is good, but with mods (in my opinion) the game can become so much more immersive and enjoyable. my favorite open world rpg to date. oh yeah, and its theme is one of the best in any game ever :d",166.6
"when you think waht is vidya gaem?. you think of skyrim. this is the essence of gaming as a whole in a tight  sexy body 20 gigabyte package. if you could suck a games , youd stroke skyrims balls first, then skip the fellatio and then shove the shaft in your  and squeeze down. they get everything right in this masta piece: they got es, memes, guns, modern warfare, zombies, cremes, guns, open world, feeding, spicy stories, being afk. they have it all. if there was a complaint to be had it could only be that it triggered an era of gaming that copied this godlike formula and gave birth to games like pacman, half-life, last of us, and even the renown call of counter-strike. so next time you ask yourself to describe the best of gaming, just  on your keyboard, boot skyrim, and install a bestiality mod. - 6/10",78.5
"some pros and cons but the overall product is nice, a very addicting game with mods.",1315.8
"this game is epic in scale with great combat mechanics and is always fresh with the many thousands of mods you can apply. and if you have an interest in game design or level design the creation kit could be for you, it allows you to customise almost every aspect of the game so get out there and get it!",82.3

"what can i say other than i never knew scandinavia could look so . 5 hours in i realised that the last 5 hours had felt like 3 days with a host of badly animated dragons, shity combat, terrible ui and a terrible story and quest system. although the graphics and gameplay were significantly better than that hole in the ground called oblivion, skyrim still lacks any form of fun that we have all come to expect from bethesda; which wasnt much in the first play. while this is no morrowind, i didnt expect bethesda to bend me over and  me in the  with  dlc, bad workshop content and a vanilla game thats only fun if you mod it beyond recognition. graphics: 3/10 gameplay 0/10 nords being nords 0/10 education: went to college of winterhold 2/10 i wanted to kill myself during the opening sequence 5/10 overall 1/10",58.7

"of all the people ive ever talked to, ive never found one who held overly negative thoughts about the elder scrolls v: skyrim, and rightly so. sure, its not perfect; the game tends to hold the players hand and leveling is easy compared to the leveling in oblivion, but skyrim is a big picture game. the excitement of discovery, the sprawling overworld, the power of choice, the ability to craft your character how you see fit - these are the core elements which have drawn millions of gamers into bethesdas snowy wonderland for dozens, even hundreds of hours. the attention to detail in skyrim is absolutely ludicrous, and despite complaints about the elder scrolls floaty-feeling combat, skyrim is able to deliver an incredibly realized world with the depth in combat to boot. the sneak-archer, melee-brawler and mage builds are all viable (though i dont recommend being a mage) and feel different enough to warrant multiple playthroughs. the skill tree system (now with an infinite level cap) incentivizes further gaming due to the perks it gives for each respective skill, giving longtime veterans another reason to keep playing. in the end, theres so much to skyrim. a thorough review of the game could be as long as full-blown college essay, so ill leave it this: for any gamers who havent yet played skyrim, play it. you wont regret it. 10/10",193.6

"skyrim is a very aesthetically beautiful game. the storyline is very decent and it has a certain catch to it. since it is an open world singleplayer game you have an extremely large set of options on how you personally want to complete the game, and as far as i know there is an insane amount of side quests that will grant certain loot and gear to the player. there are two dlcs to the game that fits perfect with the default game, and it adds a lot of new items and features. the walking animations could definitely be improved, and the many side quests could have a bit more creativity to them. in general though, skyrim is a great game!",339.9

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4
"skyrim certainly had a lot to love up to after the wonderful experience that was oblivion. after playing over 100 hours i can safely say that it lives up to it, and then some. skyrim is a stunning open world rpg with so much to do and so many places to see. the class and race variety is really deep so that you can play with pretty much any style you like. the theme of the place is mostly snow but there are a lot of different themes too with some of the nice green landscapes that we liked from oblivion. if you decide to just wander off somewhere you will always run into a new place with something to do. the main quest can be brief if you just follow this but the side quests really open things up and add to the whole skyrim experience. overall i loved the game and would put it in the must play section. would run into whiterun and kill all the people just for the lulz again. 10/10",107.2

"this is my 3rd copy of skyrim, ive bought the original for the playstation 3, then the game of the year edition for it. now ive owned it for pc for a while and i love the modding community! it does take away from the game, knowing if you ever get in a harsh battle that you can just type tgm and go charles manson on everyone, but the upscaling of the graphics, updated textures (free dlc), and the insane amount of mods make this port a show stopper.",39.3
"very fun game, a little confusing at the start but you get to learn the controls after a few swings. awesome graphics, very pleased.",11.6
"the deepest and most exciting single player rpg there is, hands down!",13.6
"my future husband recomended this game to me and i was a skeptic at first nothing could replace everquest i thought. but after playing just a few hours i was hooked. now 525 hours later i still and enthralled and mesmerized by the beauty and lore of this game. i have gotten a friend to buy and play and will recommend it to anyone who asks how i like the game. great work and thank you for your time and effort in the development of such an amazing game.",692.5
"first off, let me say this: skyrim is not the grand culmination of the elder scrolls series. skyrim is not the most amazing thing to ever roll across your computer screen. that said, it is a noteworthy addition to the series for its technical advancements, as well as the accessability it brings to newcomers to the es franchise. pros: ~very good learning curve ~beautiful graphics and sound ~much improved voice acting over previous games ~maintains the sense of freedom ~decent balancing ~god-awful speech wheel game is gone cons: ~story inconsistency. before you get angry, i am referring to the sense of continuum in the game, that is, there is none. you can become a legend by finishing any major quest line, but yet, npcs outside of that specific line show no change in attitude or conversation, even though they should logically have heard of you. this was something that morrowind did well, but oblivion and skyrim fall flat on their face in this regard. ~hand-holding. skyrim is extremely user friendly, but it is to the point that even on legendary difficulty, the game has little in the way of challenge. there is a cursor at all times to guide you, and there is virtually no situations that require legitimate puzzle-solving. all in all, an excellent game, that i highly recommend.",201.4

"i could type up a long review for this game and explain how great it is in-detail. but words cant describe such a beautiful game. it released in 2011, and still graphically tops most releases today. and with mods only further improving the aesthetics, its amazing eye candy. the main story is average. but with the tons and tons of side-quests, it comes together for an amazing universe and story with great lore. ive found myself spending a lot of time simply reading the books within the game. the sword combat isnt anything to write home about. its the same as all tes games, though, and sadly isnt on par with oblivions difficulty. but throw in magic and other ways to fight, its still entertaining. the environments are amazing. throwing away the bland and copy-paste dungeons of oblivion, each new location is filled with fun enemies and beautiful views. all in all, skyrim is my most played title and amazing in every right. if you are still thinking about getting skyrim, i recommend you do it asap. with tons of mods to fix the slightest problems you might find or to simply improve your own experience, its a game that hardly ever gets old. i highly recommend you get it.",466.6

"so far ive sunk over 100 hours into this game and i havent even finished the main storyline yet. i love being able to disappear into another world for a few hours at a time and this game is perfect for that. and with all the mod possibilities, even after the main story is completed, it really doesnt ever have to end.",190.7

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"skyrim is one of the most impersive games that you could expecience. but youre going to hate the first few quests. i love skyrim but the opening could have been much better. the opening aside, the rest of the game is creative, new and completely fresh. nothing about this game is like other rpg adventure titles. skyrim is a game where choice is real, you have the chance to do anything and everything. you can join the theives guild and the companions, join the dark brotherhood and the dawngaurd. its simply like living another life. i just bought this game on pc after having the xbox version for almost 2 years and i dont regret it, skyrim is so i can buy it twice and be satisfied, i did this with other titles and had buyers remorce but not skyrim. this game only got better on pc. and from someone who knows everything about skyrim i cant stress this enough, its completely worth buying if you already have it, i do recommend getting it when its on sale. like i did. and just saying this for people who havent played, the dlc for this game are completely worth it.",33.0
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",248.6

"being a person that really doesnt play these kinds of games with dates set in the past and swords, magic and everything, this has to be one of the best games that ive ever played and will continue to play. i usually play this game when i am bored or have nothing to do, but in the time i have on it. its fun weither i have lots of hours and am a pro or not. 20/10",22.5
"talk about the game that keeps on giving. this game is a must-own for pc users! thanks to the modding community this game never gets boring, the amount of user-created content is literally limitless!!!! i cannot stress enough how amazing this game is. with the right mods you can be looking at (at the least) 2k textures throughout the entire game, with some options at a near photo-realistic quality, in others this game can easily compete, if not surpass all of the next-gen games so far released (looking at you watch_dogs) absolutely 10/10 game cannot recommened highly enough",182.7
"always worth it, buy it if youre missing out. the base game is fun and i spent over a hundred hours in the xbox360 version but the pc version opened up a new world of possibilities for me. the pc version has mods which can increase your place time from 5 hours to 100 more hours. there are literally hundreds of mods out there. the modding community is still active right now. even if you prefer oblivion or morrowind, might as well get skyrim since fans have already started remaking the aforementioned games in the skyrim engine. though buggy, mods can fix that. if you are looking for some fun mods, i recommend going to nexusmods instead of the steam workshop, because the mods arent limited by file size, and can do more complex things than the mods from the workshop. for all you lore nerds out there, there are plenty of books in the game, and dont like the graphics? mods can fix that too.",179.8
"this game so far is amazing. the world is very easy on the eyes and decent to navigate about. i have enjoyed each quest and puzzle as they have come along and have not become bored of the side quests as this world has been so well done. the musical score is excellent, the character progression is entertaining on all counts. if you havent played the elder scrolls you have to experience it if you are a fan of this kind of gendre. my only critique is the voice overs need to have more voice actors and variation as from time to time the same actors can get repetitive. other than that... ***** 5 stars for a fantastic game.",133.4

"the best rpg ever made. the storys not amazing, but the gameplay and the vast open world is worth exploring (and its fun to do so). skill trees are intuitive, dialogue is quick, and the quests are plentiful. i have played it for over 1,000 hours. truly glorious.",564.4
"theres no game that goes to the same lengths to create a world than skyrim. it really sells you on its world, from the fantastic graphics to the true sense that this world would get on just fine without you poking around. my only criticisms is the interface is poor on pc and being a mage can feel like half your fight is with the menus and also there never seems to be any lasting effect of your escapades. people respond to you in similar ways at the beginning as when you are a champion.",32.9
"very addictive and tons of quests and things to do. only down side is that if a quest giver dies yo can never start the quest of turn it in. unless your on the pc so you can spawn another person using the console. but besides form that and not being able to have multiple character files i say a 4.5/5",195.7

"this game is pretty much amazing and is the king of rpgs. additional use of the workshop can improve graphics and game play further to your liking which just makes it even better (highly recommend using the workshop from the get-go). warning: this game is big and as a result it takes a while to get into it. i find a lot of people do not enjoy the first 1-2 hours of game play. that may seem like a lot, but this game easily consumes over 100 hours and so the beginning is relatively small. additionally, this game is focused on the rpg and story aspects and less so on the combat. the combat is good but its nothing fancy.",63.3

"great game for anyone who loves rpg and action games, for anyone who likes killing monsters and dragons and for anyone who knows to appreciate a good story. the graphics are great, tho there are alot of glitches with it (which somtimes makes the game more funny). the only 2 problems i have with the game are- 1) the menu in-game is built for consoles- but it doesnt really matter. 2)once you start playing the story you cant stop-not because the game doesnt allow you to, because its too damm addicting!

"hugely fun and its definately easy to waste more time then you originally intended. can get rather repetitive after a few playthroughs but hey... thats what mods are for, right? but seriously, this game does have a few flaws however thanks to the modding community most of them arent a problem, for me at least. even if you arent a fan of modding games skyrim will still give you 20 bucks in entertainment and a whole lot more.",241.5
"i played 60 hours into this game and didnt even start the main storyline. i explored about 70% of the world and had enough side missions available to keep me busy for another 60 hours. there is a lot of gameplay value here, and the missions are all quite fresh, unique, substantial and relatively tied to the world as a whole so youll finish one mission somewhere and go to some other place and realize it was tied to this person or mission and things have changed because of the way you handled a supposedly unrelated mission. any playstyle is valid. raging hercules? okay. robin hood? okay. garrett the thief? okay. simon the sorcerer? okay as well. play like you want, the game doesnt care and it will react as if it were really supposed to be played just like youre playing it. at some point after about 50 hours of playing youll start to become a walking machine of death and the game gets a little redundant. youll max out skill trees with the option of making them legendary (bad idea, no value to it other than the title) but other than that there isnt a great deal of progression beyond a certain point. plenty of content, just not much progression. then you start downloading mods and realize youre never going to be playing this for umm.. quite some time more..",75.4
"hi, my name is mr z3r0 gravity and i am a skyrim addict. let me makae this perfectly clear. this is a must-have title for all the fantasy geeks out there. the gameplay is fantastic, the world itself is invigorating and breathtaking, and some of the characters you will meet on your travels will become like your friends. you will talk to them. you will talk to yourself. this is completely normal. if you are someone who likes mods, the steam workshop has an excelent assortment of fantastic mods! (my personal favorite is inigo) now, my computer sucks, so this is more my fault than anything, but the game can be a little bit buggy. especially when you start modding it. regardless, i give this game a 9/10",264.3

"wow... i was blown away by this game so mush content for only $20.00 now. this is a must buy if you like one of the following action openworld huge modding community fantasy role playing killing dragons. this game has countless hours of content main missions, hours of side missions. you have guild you can join darkbrotherhood, thiefs guild, the companions. (sorry if i left some out) you can craft and make new items you can make potions, enchantments for weapons. you play how you want you want to be a evil theif go ahead. you want to be a mage go ahead if you want to be a brute go ahead. if you want to be all three go ahead. but sadly no game is perfect. the game has glitched ozzing out of it. everyone thats not important sound the same(i can see why there is tons of people but a few more voice acters could make a big diffrence.) but wait theres more mods mods and more mods. the modding community is huge and i mean huge. there are mods for everything, you want more weapons you got it. you want diffrent homes well you can have a mansion. you want to be lazy and have everything handed to you well ok you got it. in short it is a very good game and is worth buying.",102.4

"its a great game. it feels very much like a wide open adventure where you can do so many things.....all to your choosing. the landscape is a little bleak but sets the tone. there is so much to explore and you can find many many new things in each playthrough. add in so many great mods and its quite ridiculous what you can do in skyrim. i give this my highest recommendation. i may have to fire up a playthrough just thinking about it.",638.4
"i personally think this is one of the best open world games ive played so far, aside from oblivion and morrowind. skyrim, to me, seems to be a watered down version of an elder scrolls game, but with much better graphics of course. its fit more for console gamers, but this is still an awesome game, i actually like playing this game with a controller to be honest. if you want a more in depht, complicated elder scrolls game, buy oblivion or morrowind. i also like the fact that this game has a steam workshop where you can download mods for your game to alter your experience, whether itd be graphics, new hair styles, weapons, quests, just about anything you want to add to your game. definitely a must have if youre a fan of open world fantasy games that let you do or go wherever you wish.",249.5

"great game with great and sometimes funny mods. i also like the fact that if you dont want to be in a specific group like the dark brotherhood you dont have to... i completly and utterly distroyed the person who kidnapped me =d though, i do wish that the developer and or writers could have included some type of romance, as i find it hard to believe that someone would marry you just because you are wearing a necklace and did a favor for them.",170.9

"oh dear skyrim....let me count the ways i so adore you. how many hours have i spent in your open world finding places to explore while on a mission. how many hours have i spent creating items, selling, buying, even stealing in some occasions. youve kept me entertained in so many ways. the combat is sometimes magical and other times sweaty and crude. ive beat you without mods and with and you continue to entice me for more. 10/10...i say no more.",731.3

"this game is if i am not mistaken 4 years old now and people like me still love it, with a bit of mods this game looks soo beautiful ( next gen lvl and ). this game is still fun to play and its amazing at what it does :d",175.4

"this is a pretty good game. i might edit this review to not be only an achievement holder, later.",292.5
"i discovered skyrim after hearing my buddies talk about it at college. i had never been into the rpg-style games, and was a bit unsure about whether or not i would actually enjoy it. boy was i wrong. the best part about this game is that, even after youve beaten the main quests (even on all the dlcs!), theres still so much more to do. whether you want to collect all the dragon priest masks, rack up infinite bounties in all the holds, or just mess around and throw buckets at people, skyrim offers a bajillion different options. and with mods, you can spend days - weeks, even - just messing around and having fun. probably the biggest compliment i can give this game is that it got my friend - who never played video games before and said that she thought they were lame - hooked. so well done, bethesda. maybe you should look back at this and try not to  up elder scrolls online so much.",255.1

"one of the most moddable games outside of quake. -combined with almost limitless replayability, even with a vanilla save, the game will last you for untold amounts of hours. combat is a little clunky sometimes, but this is one game you probably owe yourself to playthrough once. #wabbajack",16.3
"this game is an amazing expansion to an already amazing series. adds to the depth of tamriel. game does pose a few issues but other than that it is an excellent buy.",361.2
"best game ive ever played in my life everything is amazing about thisw game. the weapons, armor, charator cutomization, the side quest, and the dragons!!!! i cant even say everything that is good about this game the review would be to long and i wanna keep short and sweet. this game is worth any price they sell it for!!!!!",53.5

"everything about this game screams quality and adventure. while bethesda hasnt exactly got a track record for delivering bug-free games at launch, this has been a pleasant, polished and amazing experience so far. a much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system thats amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do. truly a masterpiece.",636.1
"amazing and a worthy successor to its predecessor the elder scrolls 4: oblivion a must play, hours of fun and an almost endless exploration of the northern province of tamriel",466.3
"short review: 50 hours and more of pure fun. if you enjoyed oblivion or witcher series, you should definitely try this one. good points: * good enough main story and insteresting subquests * aswesome graphics and landscapes * skill trees and combat * huge world * best elder scroll so far. * open worldness (you feel quite free) bad points * can easily become too easy if you abuse the game (unbalanced) * can lose interest if leave the main story. * repetition. (ex: killing the first dragon is cool but afterward it becomes too easy and boring chasing them)",109.8
"such a wonderful time sink. i just wish i had more time to play it.",30.0
"beautiful highly realistic graphics, smooth gameplay and enjoyable quests truly makes the elder scrolls v: skyrim the game to beat.",37.3

"people call you dragonborn. people worship chicken more than dragons. /10",367.0
"this game is a must play for anyone interseted in role playing. it also gives players a new feel for an open world game. the gameplay is endless and extremely fun. skyrim is one of the entertaining games i have ever played.",71.4
"this game is a masterpeice. ive played this loads on xbox and have started playing on pc so i can enjoy the dlc (you can buy the dlc on xbox edition.) alot of the negative reviews say its boring untill you mod which yes it dose make it more fun but if youre pc cant handle the mods dont worry, youre not missing out on anything too major. i could reccomend this to any gamer, casual, underground, competetive ect ect. the reason that this game so good is the combination of its 2 main elements: 1) the story is epic (no major spoilers here.) you can kill dragons and even better its your duty to do so. there are thousands of side quests and guilds you can join which all have there own in depth storylines that keep on intresting you. 2) you can do whatever the hell you want, dont like the stroy? fine go hike up a mountain searching for rare plants. go assasinate a whole village. go scream at old men and push people off cliffs. the list is endless. you can be a assasin mage, which there many unique schools of magic, a tank a alchemist, a blacksmith again possibilties is endless. the mix of epic questing and doing random gubbins like stealing people clothes right of their backs is what makes sikyrim skyrim. (also killing the emperor is fun!)",66.9
"cant play it without mods.. gets so damned boring all the time.",135.9

"very fun, high replayability, graphics are pretty good.",100.8
"got a level 31 character on ps3 but that still didnt stop me from getting this for pc as well. if you thought oblivion was good then skyrim is the game for you.",7.1
"one of my favorite games of all time. no restrictions on what you can do like in the previous elder scrolls games. a little glitchy at certain points, but nothing that cant be fixed with the command console and a wikia site. (besides, bethesda is always updating the game to fix those problems.) and with them releasing dlcs like dawnguard now its only going to get better. no two people can play it the exact same way, theres just that much out there. for mods, id recommend: berts breezehome remodel (available via skyrim nexus) spend dragon souls for perks (perfect for when youve gotten all the shouts and have leftover dragon souls) realistic map + roads!",1132.9
"nothing out of the ordinary. just an open-worlded wrpg that only got halfway on the road trip to downright perfect quest design but, just like literally every quest in the game, only went halfway before saying the next objective is that far away??? f*ck this, immah play some tf2 and come back later. and never came back. oh, also, it broke the completionist. thats a thing it did.",26.5

"not much to say about skyrim. its like any other elder scrolls game in the series, except for the fact that skyrim is rather simplified. i do suggest picking it up though mainly because of the mods that are simply outstanding, allowing you to craft a good game into something unimaginably spectacular.",105.0
"best ing rpg game that i have had the honor to play. easy to mod, fun to get into, vivid graphics, the list goes on. if you want a rpg where you can kill dragons, slay vampies/werewolves, and just about do anything youve wanted to do in lord of the rings then this game has your name written all over it. 10/10, bad  game.",173.6
"its a wow experience in single player sandbox rpg fantasy medieval gaming. no other game comes close.",325.5

"you are reading this because you want to know if the game is worth the $$. your mistake was not buying it already. with the modding community plus the dlc you could spend months playing this game and experience new things every day. go. buy. play.",90.2
"this game is unique and i have only good things to say about it.the elder scrolls was my entrance in the rpg games.skyrim has a good story line and you can choose on if you are bad or good.you do not need to respect some rules about what to do or who you want to kill.in conclusion it is the best single player rpg you can play.",79.7
"i recommend to play skyrim. this is the first game in years, which i would say is worth its money. a lot of content, 5 major quest lines, and uncountable side quests and missions. the world is huge, and nice in various ways. each dungeon is well planned and makes a lot of fun to adventure them. if you rush, you can play through a dungeon in 6-7 minutes, but normally, you will end up in discovering each and every corner of each and every room, and in the end, you needed more than 1 hour for the cave. if you like rpg-games, you have to play this game. its a must. i hope that a lot of other games will follow the quality of this game. 10/10 points for skyrim",349.4
"this is best game. i own it on three systems and enjoy each time i play through.",27.4

"good lord, theres too much to say. if you liked any of the other es games, get this. thats all there is to it. you shoot voices at people and poke them with swords and stuff. get it, seriously. tons and tons of mods, you can play this game for days on end and still get new content to it from the community.

"first time i played this when i preordered in 2011, i was very disapointed, the game was very buggy and some of the stuff the devs said they would put in wasnt there, skyrim wasnt anytihng like i expected and im dissaponited, but i did spend a lot of time on it, because cmon, its an elder scrolls game, but oblivions better. go buy oblivion kids, its more for your money.",104.7

"i really enjoy this game and find it much more enjoyable with mods. they add so much to the experience that im extremely glad i got it on steam rather than a console.",380.5
"definitely love this game and i also enjoy trying out mods for this game too. :)",93.6
"probably one of the best games ive ever played. even though it is a little old, it still is a great game. skyrim has a lot of things to do other than the main quest line. plus there are mods that adds even more content to the game. would game again 10/10",73.8
"seriously, no jokes. before buying this game (in dec. 2013), i played over 180 hours of fallout 3 and nv. that being said, this game feels like a straight copy of fallout 3 / nv with dragons, swords, and magic. there are improvments though. this game is more beautiful, combat is more refined, as well as many other things. but when i play it, everything instantly screams fallout. i guess if it aint broke dont fix it. i was just wondering what all the fuss over this game was about. i mean fallout is pretty much the same thing, but all i ever hear about is skyrim. that being said, skyrim is a great game and i look forward to putting 100+ hrs into it.",33.9
"one of the best games i ever played. most atmospheric bethesda game, best voice acting from a bethesda game but a bit lack luster in content in comparison to previous elder scrolls installments. nonetheless, it is still a fun and enjoyable game to play and made only better with the modding community. highly recommend to mod the game. p.s. hail ulfric and the stormcloaks!",194.0
"very well done. this game is as good as oblivion. while the quests may be more hand-holding and less figure things out, the game did manage to balance the leveling up system. the perk tree is more enjoyable than having to micromanage progression of skills. again, another world you can be absorbed in for 100 hours and still not do everything. also, kids cant die for whatever reason. hide in a town, kill people and watch as everyone panics. hilarity ensues.",48.8
"awsum also get the oblivion and morrowind and even get the daggerfall and arena",156.0

"a must have with incredible content, great community (dozens of mods) and very nice feeling. only some minor bugs preventing to give it 10/10. anyway, one the the best games in last decade...",120.3
"wow! im not sure where to start on this grand game. i have and continue to enjoy this classic game as indicated by the many hours i have spent adventuring with my many companions. you cannot and will not be bored as long as you seek out the next few hundred quests heaped upon the hundreds of quests you have already completed. played on a pc, this is a modders wonderland. the cinematic beauty contained within the huge open world that is skyrim is totally awesome as evidenced by the thousands of screenshots posted each and every day on the steam servers. i will never finish this game. this is not a game to be won or finished by trying to follow the main quest lines. this game is like a fine wine; to be enjoyed by sitting by a lake and enjoying a wonderful view. climbing that mountain in the distance. running with your companions through the meadows and fields, riding your horses to the next town and enjoy some brews with the villagers. singing songs and dancing on tables. killing vampires, werewolves, bandits, dragons, and any manner of bad guy that you can imagine. this game is only limited by limited thinkers. enjoy this game for what it truly is, an epic masterpiece to be enjoyed by an adventurer. gamers need not apply. have fun and long live the dragonborn!",492.4
"with 300 hours played in this game, i can safely say that there is a near-unending amount of content. bethesda made another great game, with stunning and original story lines, and if you do manage to make it through their main content, and the numerous dlcs, there are thousands of side quests that require you to explore a huge and fantastically made world, with every rock and mountain designed thoughtfully, and hundreds of mods and player built dlc, bethesda has crafted a stunning new chapter to their amazing elder scrolls series",305.9
"200 hours later, im not sure i should have played this, but it was certainly good...",200.2
"probably the best game ive played so far. everything about this game is great. really worth the money.",130.4
"being a fan of the elder scrolls series since morrowind, i had high expectations for this installment. you see, when i got my hands on oblivion i was somewhat disappointed due to the fact that it seemed like somewhat of a downgrade in regards to the story, gameplay, and map size. i still had fun with oblivion, so its not like it was a bad game, but it just didnt hold up to what i wanted to be. anyways, because of this experience, coming into skyrim my expectations werent nearly as high. but i was blown away! this game is a very well done game and a step forward for the franchise. i wont go too into detail, because if you havent at least heard of this game than youve been hiding under a rock.",162.5
"skyrim is everyting a lover of the elder scrolls saga wants and more. a beautiful (botf graphic as with story as with gameplay) freeroam rpg. the game has many variations in things you can collect, discover and mod on the game. i think this game raises the expectations for the freeroam rpg games on launch and long after. there is a catch however. this game was fun while it lasted, but it didnt convince me to come back and finish what i started. 80hrs+ and still i didnt beat the game because i wanted it to last, but being able to that kind of long run did turn me off in the end.",95.0
"ive never been a fan of the bucolic. i much prefer the man-made harshness of concrete and neon to the pastoral settings the fantasy genre has chained itself to. skyrim manages to enchant me though. packed with abandoned locales and small villages, i felt more like a tourist than a warrior. lakes, caves, and snow-covered mountaintops are repositories of mysteries that i couldnt help but dig through.",243.0
"73 hours and counting. need i say more? this game is extremly addicting. it get even more fun once you learn how to use mods.",75.3

"dragons n stuff..... just what the badge i get for writing a review.",36.2
"this is my first foray into the elder scrolls series, though i bought oblivion and morrowind and will get around to exploring those eventually. i played a little of morrowind but not enough to form an opinion yet (so far its neato!). its one of the most beautiful games ive ever played and the music is gorgeous and haunting. ive sunk many hours into this game but i still havent completed the main questline. ill get around to it eventually, but theres so much to do and see that it doesnt matter. im thinking i should increase the difficulty a bit. its easy to cheese everything if you choose blacksmithing, enchanting, and alchemy. the combat overall could be better. however, there are many, many mods that fix the games flaws and add all sorts of wonderful things. do you want to add more immersion? well, there are survival mods that affect the food you eat, how deeply the cold influences your behavior, and how you attack. if you dont like something, get a mod that changes it! if you need a desert island game this one is it due to its endless replay value.",327.3
"this game is resonsible for taking days of my life",31.8
"not sure why it took so long to purchase and play skyrim. ive only logged about 10 hours but i am thoroughly hooked. definitely worth every penny as a solid sandbox style game that has hours upon hours of playtime to be had.",209.5
"i feel like everything that could have been said about this game has been said already but here goes.. if skyrim did not win you over with its amazing graphics then you can always look to the amazing action gameplay of skyrim. dont like action? skyrim includes one of the most amazing stealth mechanics of any game that can be used from early on to the end of the game. dont like stealth either? theres always frickin magic! dont like magic? ....the hell are you doing playing video games... but highly understated is the storyline of skyrim, playing as the last dragonborn to defeat alduin and save tamriel. the main storyline gives 70+ hours of gameplay and hundreds more with the side quests not to even mention the dlc and the infinite amount of mods from the workshop. overall one of the best games of all time and worthy of its amazing legacy! -10/10 ~delta",346.3

"much has already been said about this game. definitely an essential addition for any es fan. no more creepy zoom in when speaking to someone like in oblivion, skill system is fantastic, and combat is very nice. personally, i like the finishing blow cutscenes, lets you actually get a good look at your character in action. fantastic game when you want to play a big rpg alone.",204.6

"the game by itself (althought very buggy for a finished product) is amazing and is worth a buy, but then you throw in all the mods and how easy its made with various tools and programs like the steam workshop, nexus mod manager, loot (load order optimization tool), and tes5edit, you can make skyrim into a completely new experience, many times over, with all the mods out there + the original game you could easily spend all of or most of your life playing skyrim and still not have seen everything, theres seriously that many mods out there (note some may not be compatible with others). if youre going to get into modding thought definitely invest in the nexus mod manager, steam workshop is good but if you eventually decide to switch your mods from steam versions to nexus version youll have to go through a real headache and possible have to re-install the game like i did, either way my point is buy this game.",179.2
"such a diverse game completely customizable especially when installing mods that allow you to play it however you want! (emphasis on the you hahahaha) such an amazing role-playing experience, each and every run through always leads to a completely new story, wonderful replayable value: it has never become boring and stale. definitely a game needed in your library to make into the gaming experience you want it to be, please take time and effort to invest in this game and the nexus site for mods. one of my all time favourites in gaming! thank you bethesda!!! <3",562.0
"i went into this game with high hopes, ive heard good things, ive heard bad things, but i finally decided to get my own opinion about it. after about 35h playtime ive come to a conclusion. this game isnt that great. before you  yourself let me explain, ive explored almost the entire continent, gone into every cave, ruin, and mine i came across, even attempted some of the quests, but basically the only thing this game has going for it is the decent looking environment, thats it. exploration was fun for that 35 hours, but then i realized something, this game has some boring  quests. nothing at all in comparison to morrowind, and especially nothing in comparison to oblivion, which had some pretty incredible quests, this installment was just a disappointment. i wanted to like it, but you cant really force yourself to like something that is just 85% poorly designed. i recommend any aspirant buyers to wait until it is very low in price, or pirate it, i dont give a , just dont pay full price for this mediocre bethesda title.",38.4

"honestly one of the best elder scroll games i have ever played. i own it on all of my consoles (dont ask me how that happened) but i completed every quest on the game including the dlc on my xbox and now in the midst of doing that on pc for badges/achievements. and if you think its fun but want more just mod the hell out of it!!",25.3

"after first 20 hours you will realize this game is excactly the same stuff... just go, explore (same caverns), kill, wow dragon, kill, try to steal something and sell it to a random guy, then repeat all. it can get interesting with some mods, but it can get buggy as well. only if you have a lot of time to waste.otherwhise go for the elder scrolls oblivion.",59.2

"i think myself and most of the rest of the world would recommend this game... lol. but no, seriously, i took a first look at this game, and said, nope... never gonna get me to play that. then my friend told me how good it was, and let me borrow it... and then i just had to buy it. if you havent played it- you will love it. i dont think it matters if youre an rpg, fps, rts, or whatnot, im pretty sure theres something for everyone in this game, the puzzles, the small stories, the quests... and its such a huge map, you can play this thing a few times, and still see different things each time. just a tip though, make sure you install at least the hd textures before you play, the graphics are a little dated. also, if youre a hardcore graphics person, youtube gopher and his series on how to mod skyrim. if you havent played it before, i wouldnt mod the gameplay at all- but feel free to mod the graphics systems to your hearts content! enb makes everything look so amazing in this game- the stars and the nightsky look so realistic, as well as the shadows and the direction lighting system.",9.2

"skyrim is a testament to lastability through community, something that can be said for only games like dota, counter strike and wow. for the most part, skyrim serves as a complete rework since oblivion, which is great, because it finally gave people a stable, and pleasant to look at platform to woork with. it has all the great fantasy elements, a solid soundtrack and versatile graphics. things that morrowank could never even hope to obtain, unless it was a mod for skyrim. and this is its lastability, since the advent of the steam workshop (and shortly before, for nexus users), skyrim has been able to outlast most other games by several years through simply adding a handful of mods. it has allowed everyone to create everything ridiculous and stunning, completely rework the game or even, as aforementioned, rework other games (or just fix them, in morrowinds case). if for nothing else, i certainly recommend you download skyrim to have some mod-friendly fun. oh yeah theres a storyline somewhere too, i think. dont worry about that though",430.4
"faffing about simulator 2011 if you still dont know about skyrim then congrats on your nobel prize that youve clearly won for developing a way to breath on mars! 300 mods/10",175.1
"i love this game. it keeps me entertained for hours at a time. it is even better because of the steam workshop allowing you to continually add and upgrade new content. i love that you can choose your own destiny and be what ever you want. i also like the whole marriage concept. usually in a game i am afraid to do any of the marriage quests because it is a real person and you never know who you are dealing with. but this has actual characters that you can marry which makes it safe. the only thing i have found that i wish was better is the character choices. the hairstyles and war paint markings are almost the same for all the races and the colors could be more varied too. other than that this game is the best one i have played so far with or without all the add-ons.",583.4
"a monumental and obligatory slap in the face to all rpgs ever conceived. skyrim is an outstanding achievement in game design, concept, and atmosphere. a harrowing journey across lands filled with no limits of imagination; a story foretold which is the elder scrolls. magic, weaponry, and combat await in a new world to discover. stories to be heard, quests to be conquered. and dragons to kill. no game can match this world, this time, this era which lives in skyrim. with a large modding community, the game can only get better.",118.4
"i tried oblivion very late into the game, only a couple of months before skyrim was released and to tell you the truth i disliked it. a couple of years prior i also played bethesdas newest game: fallout 3 and couldnt get into that as well; however, skyrim was a brilliant masterpeice of a game that really was my first proper rpg. i have spen collectively over a hundred hours playing this game(i got it first on console) and there is still much more to do. there is a play style for any type of player. after getting this i would strongly suggest buying fallout 3, and new vegas as going back to that franchise with skyrim still on my mind has made me a fan of that series as well. be warned there are a lot of bugs in bethesda games, small and game breaking. p.s. the modssssss 9/10",36.3

"after two years this is still an awesome game. especially with all the mods that make it almost a new game. i played it on the ps3 but picked it up on the pc since it was on sale and added a bunch of mods, and its great. if you like open world exploration youll love it. if youre not big into exploring and discovering youll prolly find it boring. but overall its an awesome game.",92.3

"dont buy the game for the game, buy the game for the mods! if you want a game that have endless possiblities due to an active mod community then this is one of those games (as are most bethesda games). if you want a good standalone game that you dont have to do anything to and is bug free... keep walking this isnt that game.",364.3

"if you want to say: hey, i just finished skyrim then dont play this game. you dont finish skyrim because it is a world, not a game. almost all of the secondary quests are amazing, some of them are also as good as the main quest. you can have a lot of different playstiles like half mage half warrior, marksman assassin... also, the number of mods that there is in nexus adds a lot more variety to the world. i just love this game, sometimes i enter skyrim just to go to falkreath mounted on arvak and sleep at the dead mans drink at night and then i just go kill some dragons and clear a big dungeon. i love this game, 100% recommended ah...the life of a hero.",391.7

"one of the best games i have ever bought, highly recommend this. action packed rpg with a bunch of content, wont regret buying this even if youre not a rpg enthusiast. cant get enough of this game at all. look! there are even mods that can enhance your experience. steam workshop is truly amazing since its quick and easy to use! constantly being updated too!",61.2

"interesting game. i cant say much for the depth of character building (as oblivion had a lot more options) but i can say that many perks feel more relevant. leveling is simplier now. a bit disappointed with the voice acting, but with a game this huge its not surprising to see a corner cut somewhere. overall a very worth-while game. expect to get your moneys worth here- a lot to do and it seems the quests never end!",200.4

"great game you can just play this games for days and not ger bored.",95.4
"the best game of this generation. i originally played this on ps3, but switched to pc after 130 hours of play. the vanilla game is fantastic; 1st or 3rd person, open-world with plenty of quests and characters to talk and fight with, dismal-yet-beautiful environments and comfortable fighting mechanics (for both pc and ps3). the story is not the best ive seen in gaming, but skyrims strengths are what you can do within the game, and how customisable the game is for content. you can kill enemies and friends alike, marry and live with an npc, build houses (with dlc), cast magic spells, make your own weapons and armor, mine resources, brew your own potions, explore dungeons, canverns, temples and mountaintops. plus absorb the souls of dragons. while there are still a few bugs in the game (its bethesda, expect them), there is plenty of patches and content created to fix and enhance the game. there are more mods for this game than any other game that i know of, and more are still being made. if you get sick of vanilla skyrim, try out a mod - it will change the way you play (for better or sometimes worse). every character you make, every new game you play, will be different. you will always have fun.",160.8
"this is typical elder scrolls genius in lore writing and story telling. with any elder scrolls title its like being cast in your very own fantasy novel. great story, loads to do, excellent voice acting, beautiful graphics. my only disappointment with skyrim was a completely personal disappointment because it felt less magical, and mysterious than morrowind / daggerfall. the whole feel of the game is very viking-ish and it felt like i was playing 3d heimdall or game of thrones most of the time - bit too graphically similar and imo boring to look at. i think i personally prefer the more fantastical things, like silt striders, the ghosts of daggerfall, the temples of vivec, oblivion gates? i dont know it just felt a little too much like a viking story book to me. obviously there are dragons and giants, which was amazing to experience in a game in this manner but for me at least there was never a moment where you felt like the hero of the tale, it was more about destiny than choice which in the end became fairly linear - and i just wanted to get the main quest finished so i could enjoy the game. overall though its impressive, beautiful and fairly deep as you would expect from any elder scrolls title. well worth a play and will seriously last you for playability, and re-playability. expansion packs are available and they too are all worth a try :)",350.4
"simply amazing! buy it, rent it, do what you have to play the freakin game!!",322.3
"skyrim is a game you spend hours with not because its the greatest game ever made, but because its decent as a time sink. the games depth is paper-thin. the massive world you can explore at your leisure quickly becomes repetitive as you see the same dungeon tiles cave after cave, abandoned fortress after abandoned fortress. gameplay has ridiculous limitations, case in point being the inability to block while dual wielding. graphics are adequate. the story is nonexistent and what little is there is extremely bland. now, mods. they do make the game a lot better so if you wish to make your skyrim into a frankensteins monster go ahead, youll get a better experience for it. mods range from graphical upgrades to full gameplay overhauls and everything in between. without mods or vanilla, be warned.",398.2

"this game is incredible. it is so vast and beautiful and will make you gasp with awe as you see the land. it has so many quests as well and it feels endless. i love how when you finally (if ever) run out of quests, the open world allows you to make up your own. the combat is a thrill and i never tire of it. learning new magic always makes me get so excited and i love the range of spells alot. this game has so many choices and options and it truely is a game worthy of the title, incredible.",84.2
"an enormous game with seemingly unlimited content. youll find yourself lost in the world of skyrim just as soon as you set your foot in it.",68.4
"what a sequel, ey! skyrim continues to add to the expanding elder scrolls timeline, in a much more stylish way. skyrim offers much more manageable controls compared to its predecessor, oblivion. as well as this, it is so much more /pretty/! the story is riveting enough to pull you through the countless fetch quests and other tedious tasks, although the pace can fall at some stages during the story - through these it is simply a fact of powering through these sections until the story picks up again. personally i wouldnt buy this game unless it was on sale, but if you are a elder scrolls fan or an avid rpg player, this game may just be worth the rrp.",10.2
"well, i usually do not write a review until i have finished the game, or at least put enough hours into it to make sure i know most of the game content, but skyrim is a different story. in fact, the story is amazing, the conbat feels a lot better and gameplay all around is amazing. the graphics are really good also if you have a nice machine to ramp up to ultra settings. the set pieces are amazing also. most times you wander into a town, duneon or any other area and it just bewhilders you of the amazing artistry that is present. the music and sound is also amazing! we cannot leave out the new perk system. like fo3, every level you gain, you get to invest a perk into any of the trees available, and wow, there are many. i could go on, and on about the great things of skyrim, but i will hit a bad note. the interface. in fact, i have no idea why they have messed up the interafce so bad since others have done it well. great game overall, but the interface is probably the biggest downside.",177.5
"this is a game that i always seem to be able to get back into after years of playing. after making the switch from console to pc, it was one of the first games i wanted to buy again. it has great replay value. though it is a little buggy from time to time, the glitches often just make me laugh and are easily fixable if they get in the way of gameplay (with the use of some commands). i can waste hours just messing around or actually play the game seriously, and that it the beauty of most open-world games. overall a great game.",98.7

"i have put in exactly 392 hours into this game since i first purchased it. despite some relatively simple ai, somewhat outdated graphics, a really irritated inventory menu and the inevitable bugs that plague the game, skyrim is one of the greatest rpgs of its era. though simpler than the previous titles of morrowind and oblivion, it allows you much more freedom than either of the two. you can build your character around your particular playstyle with no real optimal builds, and if you ever decide you dislike the way your character is set up, you can simply start training another skill and become good at it. if you spend enough time in tamriel slaying dragons and saving damsels in distress, your character can learn and master all of the different skills that are available to you. the open-world environment and hundreds of places to explore and quests to complete, you never really feel like youre being forced to go down one particular path and every time you play, youll end up discovering something new. the indepth lore surrounding the elder scrolls series heavily immerses you in the world and story, making you feel like youve stepped into another world. if you love rpgs, this is a must have.",469.8
"best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! with sharpshooters classic enb, skyrim 2k textures, w.a.t.e.r, lush trees and grass, and 126 more mods. then figuring out which mod causes your game to crash as soon as you hit play. 10/10 would buy 126 more times",121.1
"this game is a true masterpiece, i might have only around 50hrs, but thats this account (might have 250 total). spent so much time building several characters and going through different quests each time, it feels like we have a second life, and its totally worth the time spent. 10/10 this game has become the standard that following games have to surpass, even if its already a couple years old.",52.4

"this game is simply amazing. i cant say enough good about it. if theres any console game that has truly stolen my heart and really lured me back in to playing it, its definitely skyrim. with beautiful graphics, a great storyline, and the fact that the entire game is a massive open world, theres not a whole lot of bad you can say about it if you like those things in a video game. the fighting system is great, and you can play however you like, at any pace you choose. like being a brute? play a warrior character. if you think magic is cool, skyrim has that for you as well. maybe you like being sneaky, and assassin-like. there are definitely sneaky characters waiting to be played by you ninjas out there. ive invested almost 1000 hours of gameplay into this and i still havent gotten bored of it. with all the storylines in the game itself, the 3 dlc packs(i recommend buying the legendary edition so you get all of the dlc with the game.), and all the mods available, its nearly impossible to do everything that can be done. this game is extremely addicting, but i wouldnt see it as crazy world of warcraft addicting. i sometimes stop playing for a while, but i always end up coming back to play more. i love it.",976.6

"worth every penny; for the right price. certainly a great game. very dynamic, beautiful graphics but ive seen better, half-decent combat system and a phenomenal story. the only complaint i have about this game is you have to play it right the first time. dont run through once, and then make another character to do all of the side quests. take in the entire game all at once and you wont regret it whatsoever. great installment for the series which removes as much static gameplay as it can.",17.1

"after 400+ hours on xbox 360 i can definitely see why and agree, this is a game that defined a generation. dragons, quests, spells, armor, weapons, skills, giants, trolls, giant spiders and more for hardcore fantasy and action-rpg fans this game has it all. completely customizable, you make your character then you do what you want to do. see the outline of a castle on that mountain? you can get there. want to spend all your time stealing from the rich and giving to the poor ? go right ahead. or enter into the world of vampire lords and werewolves. even become one yourself. trigger your transformation into a ferocious werewolf and rip entire towns to shreds. have ocd? this is the game for you. you can now after spending 15 hours gathering loot from random dungeons all across tamriel organize your many homes into neatly organized boxes and barrels. have a pathological need to alphabetize your book shelves? you can do that too. this is a huge game. the many engulfing story lines will gladly take away days of your life. even thought to be endless due to the random quest generators. in addition to all this official content there is a huge and active modding community. this adds even more content. like i said before it is truly a game that defined a generation.",64.9

"love the game. this vesion being the legendary pack was recommended by a freind. purchased dvd rom version with map. worth every cent. one gripe though serana needs official marrage ability and dialogue. otherwise is she a lover of the dragonborn without the ability nor the lover perks? having been cured of her vampireism the comments about being so bright how can you stand it can become tiresome. the biggest gripe is being disturbed while playing or trying to play...lol ;) how about releasing all games and maps with all expansion packs included maybe before elder scrolls 6 released? (have not tried putting all elder scrolls onto one hd but want to build hd with all elder scrolls games on it one day...). pitty my disks from 1 to 5 vanished when moving a few years back...) if you like the game buy a physical copy and get your maps, if you use stream you dont get hard copies of anything. also pausing game leaving pc running seems to add up playtime i have not clocked the acual amount in world game time as shown on steam. have it paused by pressing esc and game time still logs up...",1120.5
"the elder scrolls v skyrim is a wonderus game that will keep just about any real gamer occupied for a very long time, if you got time to kill then this is a pick up. the games offers multiple storylines and you can create your own protagonist for many races and features. skyrim is a must play and i highly recommend you pick it up if you are able.",214.4

"sykrim is one of my favorites from the series. the graphics are first thing i would point out and i like the way that the voice acting for the npcs is done. the fighting system is fairly similar to other elderscrolls games. the part that i like most about elderscolls games is the ability to add your own content to the games.",91.9

"very nice quest and level system and the combat is good. i would recommned that you buy this game as it will allow you enough hours of gameplay for the cost and will also have the benifit of preparing you for elder scrolls 4. what is good is that you can actually effect the game world. there are plenty of mods and the dlc is good. i would recommend hearthfire if you like houses and added gardens will get you easy alchemy ingrediants. dawngaurd is also good and seems similar to the civil war in that you have to choose a side. dragonborn i am not sure about yet.",394.4
"an excellent game for trying out different styles of combat and really getting involved in the world. my personal favorite is archery -- taking pot shots at draugr from across the catacomb and actually hitting them is the best feeling in the world! the game is apt to bore you after a while, but thats often only because youre not in the right mindset to play it. its not for fooling around in; youll get the most out of it by actually exploring the world and being your character.",111.1
"ever since the first entry, the elder scrolls series has always featured an amazing story. skyrim delivers a beautiful environement, incredibly smooth gameplay, and an amazing soundtrack. however, the story does not measure up to previous entries. while there are an overwhelming number of quests, many of them are copy and paste fetch quests. the main story line and guild story lines can easily be finished in less than 4 hours each. while the gameplay is significantly improved from oblivion, the dificulty has dropped greatly. very often the most frustrating encounters in the game involve killing a randomly generated dragon only to find out it has killed a quest giver you were on your way to speak with. however, it must be said that the very active skyrim modding community has produced hundreds of mods that make this game worth the cost.",33.0
"skyrim in general is amazing. skyrim on pc is the best  youll ever buy. if youve played it on console, you will feel like it is an rpg, but on pc its a puzzle game, you barely have time to actually play because you mod and you mod your game, making it more and more awesome, then when you feel oh hey, now its perfect itll ctd. you start looking through your mods to see which one is the troublemaker, but you cant find it. so you reinstall skyrim, install a better mod manager, install all your mods (now only with the ones you feel are necessary, but that wont last long) and you jump on, play for 30 minutes and then crash. now you have an idea of which mods are the culprits, so you uninstall them. hop back on and play for a day or so, then install more mods and rinse and repeat. 10/10 amazing simulator for dragging and dropping files.",216.6

"in my opinion this game is an awesome rpg with a pretty good story line and lots of open world gameplay and locations to discover with side quests that will keep you occupied and lots of diffrent mods you can download to make the game even better.in the main quest line you play as the dragonborn on your quest to stop the dragons and alduin, the dragon that is bringing the other dragons back to life.and with the dragonborn and dawnguard dlc it adds extra quest lines that that can be longer than the main quest line.so i just think the game is really fun.",84.3

"man, where to begin with this game? it is absorbing, engrossing, and i lost a good bit of my life to it. i liked morrowind, and oblivion both, and this one reminds me a lot of morrowind. do not overlook the mod community. the mods are strong with this one. i for one used many lord of the rings weapons and some really great power additions, as well as replacing the moon with the death star. really good gameplay. the story is definitely not the highlight, the world is.",275.8

"how can anyone not love an elder scrolls game. i, personally, had this for the xbox 360 when it first came out and managed to max it out on that console (both level and gamerscore) apart from the dlc which i didnt purchase for the console version. i now own the legendary edition for pc and although ive already completed the main campaign on console, i still find so much enjoyment in the game itself, even without actually touching any of the dlc related missions yet.",7.8
"this game is addictive, completely. for single player, its a great game. you can install all sorts of mods to make the game just right for you. id highly recommend this game to anyone thats played any of the elder scrolls, this one is by far the best they have put out. if you like hack and slash, magic, dragons, storylines etc, this game is for you. great gaming!",110.3

"3 and a half years after its release, skyrim is still more captivating than any rpg ive ever played. the modding community is dedicated, quirky, and practical. the game is very much tailored by personal experience and values, not only in the selection of guilds, but in the character development as well. you will find yourself debating whether or not to let a man live based upon the actions of his peers, be they bandits, thalmor, stormcloaks, imperials, etc. the social dynamics of the game are often overlooked in favor of the graphic quality, questlines, and combat, but it is the dialogues and familial nature of skyrim that has truly made this an excellent experience- one id say every game enthusiast ought to appreciate. 10/10.",723.0
"simply one of those great open world games you can find around, vanille game is already great if you skip the main quest and wander around or slaughter everything in your path, you simply would have fun for over 200+ hours on 1 save game... and thats just the vanille game, skyrim is one of those games you can mod into a even greater game making it even more challaging and harsh then it would but you can make it as easy as drinking water... eitherway both ways are great its just how you play the game!",778.4

"at 20$, it is an absolute ing steal. bethesda are screwing themselves over. would pay the full price at release. one more thing. mods.",363.3
"like all things, skyrim has both positive and negative aspects to it. some say it can be boring, others claim it to be the greatest story told in gaming history. some experience game-breaking bugs before it even begins, others have spent the past two years playing with not a single error. i left the following comment on a friends review but feel it should be part of my own, too: it makes you long for a better specced rig because you know the one youre on isnt good enough to show the game at its best (even though its still amongst the best looking games ever made). have sunk countless hours into skyrim since the day it was released (i play on 360 & pc - yes, im obsessed) and havent even completed half of the main storyline. so much to do skyrim is exceedingly good at drawing you into its world and keeping you there. even when you manage to escape for a while, itll lure you back in eventually. at the end of the day, regardless of all of its other achievements though, skyrim is best at one thing in particular: its fun. not only do i recommend it as part of this review but i have actively told people, face to face, that they need to play it.",62.5
"this game is literally the best game. if someone were to lock me in a room for the rest of my life with no contact with the outside world whatsoever, and allowed me one thing to keep with me, it would be skyrim. i wouldnt even choose a computer to play it with, just thinking about the game is enough. a freat open-world game with immersive graphics, detail beyond your imagination, and limitless potential with community made mods. if you buy one game, make it skyrim.",91.6
"one of the best rpgs ive played. it has a complex storyline and is similar to the elder scrolls iii: morrowind. it has an easy to use modding kit so players can add and remove what they want and dont want. the fact that it has 3 very well made dlcs only make it better.",783.3

"theres no game that goes to the same lengths to create a world than skyrim. it really sells you on its world, from the fantastic graphics to the true sense that this world would get on just fine without you poking around. my only criticisms is the interface is poor on pc and being a mage can feel like half your fight is with the menus and also there never seems to be any lasting effect of your escapades. people respond to you in similar ways at the beginning as when you are a champion.",32.9

"i wanted to call it game of the year, what i like is that the game difficulty is not set too low and that the enivorment is very detailed, the sounds and the music are nice as well all together a impressive atmosphere. its very small, the download only has a size of 5,8gb. on the other hand, the graphics engine itself is looks very old, when you get closer to anything, all you see is edges, little texture bugs... reminds me on rage; same problem. the controls of the game are a disaster. seriously. the npc/ai players block your way , the enemy ai gets stuck at random objects. the mainquest is done very fast, (lvl 11 was enough to finish it) i think i took double the time for oblivion, at the end its just, travel - fight dragon - travel - fight dragon again. and again... uuuh so creative. the secondary quests are fun, also its fun to just ride arround with the horse and let it fall down from high mountains. its not worth the 49, wait for a special offer.",67.8

"i was first introduced to the elder scrolls series with daggerfall. loved it then, thought it was one of the best things to grace a pc, and my mind was blown when morrowind was released. oblivion was just a plesant continuation of things, and finally, skyrim.. ah skyrim. only one word comes to my mind for skyrim: epic. everything about it just feels epic, i cant think of a better way to say it. fans of the elder scrolls will adore it, and anyone being introduced to the series this way... well... theyll like it i think. i think theyll like it alot. =)",383.9

"there was a lot of hype about this game when it first came out, but i only got to play it yesterday. first thing i noticed in the game was that the graphics are . if you want decent graphics, check out the newly revamped runescape. even with all the latest skyrim mods that boost visuals, runescape beats it hands down when it comes to textures. the game is also wayy to violent. you see people killed as soon as you start. you are even forced to watch a beheading. at one point in the game, you even get the choice of killing an innocent dog. its games like these that are damaging to our society. and i havent even mentioned the cannibalism from one of the quest lines. it makes me wonder whether this game was targeted at the cannibal tribes in the papua new guinea. the only enjoyable thing that ive experienced in my 3 hours of gameplay in this game was the paranoia of shop keepers and the way they follow you around to make sure you wont steal anything. i wish bathesda could just make a game based on that. thanks for wasting 3 hours of my time.",63.0

"any game that lets you use a power to wildly fling ragdoll physic bodies off of a cliff doesnt need any other recommendation. its an elder scrolls game, which can be hit and miss for some folks, but if youre open to experiencing an open world sort of rpg with a story that lets you approach at your own pace? this is a great game. more so, if you dont like any aspect of it? you can just go ahead and download mods to change nearly any portion of it.",497.7
"what can i say, its a modern work of art. i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys free roaming rpgs!",106.1
"when ever i boot up skyrim it feels like you been away on a trip and your finally home again. i love it, and with mods its even more fantastic. fantastic!",10.5
"this game, has changed, my life, in many ways i thought not possible. 10/10",289.9
"this is the most awsome game i have ever played.i first bought it on console and it was great.a few years later i got it here. i spent more time on pc using mods and flying through the stunningly good environments. 1000000/10.",146.4
"i have played the elder scrolls v: skyrim for about a month now an i rate it overall 10/10 in the category all games and open world games. it is a great game to create lore friendly characters and make their own path to follow in the world. for instance, choosing to be a warrior, thief, or mage. as well you can make your own class builds and so on. you can also mod the game to your liking with either steam workshop mods or nexus mod manager. (i recommend nexus.) if you like open world games i recommend this game to you. i feel that everyone would love this game, even if you dont like lore friendly games, for instance world of warcraft, i still recommend you play skyrim. i do not like wow but in fact i love skyrim. i recommend this game to everybody in the gaming community!",34.1
"skyrim some people love to explore some people love to kill things me well i love every thing but skevers. but i know one thing for sure i will be spending alot of hours playing this game.",64.5
"if u ever play this game... dont expect to stop!!!",64.1
"awesome fantasy rpg game that everyone should play at least once.",584.2
"i absouletly love this game, it has so much content. the workshop that is linked to this proviedes so much simplicity but some of the mods can screw up the game with errors and crashes, but that is rare and its not the games fault is it though.",241.0
"awesome game - just wish the dead bodies dont roll around like they have no bones. easily addicted. some frustrating aspects involve being stuck at cutscenes and unable to see underwater, causing character to drown and die.",157.6

"epic game. graphics are amazing and the storyline is incredible. there are a few glitches but can be fixed with mods. without mods 9/10 with mods 10/10. :d (for steam badge :3 )",182.3
"in my time skyrim has been one of the best games ive ever played.it has all you need for an indulging play. if you like medievil, dragon age, steel clashing things then i suggest skyrim. i like skyrim for the freedom and the fact you dont need to choose a class you can make one be it, ranger, mage, battle-mage, warrior, swordsman, theif, assasin etc. its your choice. dlcs are a good addon but they are quiet pricey so the cheapest and the best(in my view) is hearthfire, the others yea, killing fighting but hearthfire is one of my favourite. you can build your own house which i think is pretty cool and raise a familiy. so yes i suggest skyrim i think its a great game and you should play it.",154.7
"played the game so much i am looking for quests, and there is alot of them in the game",68.9
"there is no game i would reccommend more highly on pc than this. this game has such huge modding potential, that it just trumps any other game that ive ever encountered. pros: huge, immersive game world easily understood rpg leveling system great potential for role playing, playing normally, or just plain messing about. cons: tha game does have a few minor shortfalls, such as some rather stiff or uninteresting npcs or an illogical guild system, but all of these problems have fixes available on the steam workshop. just get this game, now. then, go into the steam workshop and install inigo. enjoy!",207.1
"this game is perfect masterpice the game runs well on my laptop and i have noticed that chageing the grapics settings doe increse the load time but any probles can be fixed with mods gameplay is awesome a could spent my life playing this game as there is so much contente and after playing 100 hours of it you still will not of seen everything in the game probally less than half and this game has so much lore like you chould rite 10 books about the lore in this game because there is a life time amout of lore to lrean in this game and its so good and combat is good and there is many ways to play overall awesome game and one of my favroits and a must play",165.6
"easily close to morrowind in stature but not fully.",220.0
"perhaps the best rpg i have played and the expansions are well worth playing through as well.",199.1
"there are times when some games touch the fine line between video gaming and art. skyrim is definitely at the top of the list. is it a perfect game? nothing is perfect, and nothing appeals to everyone. it is, however, a clear testimony of what can be achieved through vision, passion and love of ones work. that is what bethesda offered respectfully to all of us. a huge thank you to todd howard and everyone who worked on skyrim. and jeremy soule, youre the man.",704.7
"i would like to recommend this game to all my friends, epic graphics, great story, lots of side quests that will stray you from the main story! :d",1.1
"45,000 people a day still play this game....damn...lol 2,500 a day for elder scrolls online.....free to play soon maybe?",31.8
"even with all the anticipation and extremely high expectations, bethesda delivers yet another impressive addition to the elder scrolls line.",106.8
"actually, skyrim is skyrim, and its enough. of course, you may argue the question of the best tes game as long as you want to, but you have to admit: skyrim is great.",431.0
"i love the game, it has hours of fun and play. you can immerse yourself into a fantasy world with dragons and assassins. or if you would like warriors or mages or maybe even thieves. there is so many diffferent directions you can go, and different ways you can change your own expierience.",145.6
"by far one of my favorite games. i dont even know how many times i have played through it now.",462.6
"great game. love the mods. not much else to say here; really enjoyable way to spend hundreds of hours.",49.6
"completely absorbing. whyyyyyyyy did i start playing this????? goodbye wife, goodbye friends.",99.5
"i love this game and im not even finished with my first play through. i love to explore and the dlc just adds so much more to go and do. you revisit old areas with new objectives. new areas open for you to investigate. and there is a stream of modded content. even whole towns. always check the wiki if you take a new mission and watch out for bugs.",415.2
"skyrim is a very good game, i highly recommend that you play this! i have spent a long time on this and not a second was wasted :d",39.8
"you would be  not to waste your life on this epic game.",150.2
"i dont think ive ever seen a game like this! i love how this game uses mmorpg style elements such as leveling and magic and put this into a singleplayer game. this really prolongs the enjoyability of this game and when added with a massive world makes it impossible to be done with this game in just a few days. if youre looking for something new i highly recommend this!",150.2
"this game is awesome! skyrim is a vast world with mountainous, snowy terrain, waiting to be explored. if you want more to this already massive game, i strongly recommend installing mods for the game. they make it timeless in the sense that the graphical enhancements bring the game into current gen standards. whether the mods be lore-friendly or just simply crazy, modding skyrim is, imo, a must if youre pc is up to it. this game is definately one of my favourite, if not my most favourite, games if you use mods.",279.8
"i definitely recommend this game! amazing graphics and great open world gameplay.",198.7
"this game truly deserves the title of near perfection, being one of those rare milestones that comes every so often in years of gaming. skyrim itself, is probably the best release from bethesdas elder scrolls series. story wise, this is one of the most developed storyline from the series, giving much enjoyment overall. in all honesty, we can say that the community is one of the most desirable aspect of skyrim, due to their dedication in further releases of modifications - improving much of the overall gameplay (it never hurts to crank up those graphics). it would be a pity to not try skyrim in the course of your lifetime, so its advisable to go ahead and try it!",89.6
"i have playeed this game of over 500 hours and it still amazes me",555.1
"the best rpg game ever! big open world game and mods are funny,of course with 18+ mod hehehe",115.8
"probably one of the most fun games youll ever play. this is my first elder scrolls game to play - and i have a hard time breaking away from it. its always a captivating experience each time i open it. in the world of the first person genre, skyrim sticks out and will be the bar for future rpgs to hit.",84.7
"i used to play this game like you, but then i got a pokemon in the knee.",35.6
"nothing like some good old generic skyrim, eh? while there are glitches in this game, it holds a special place in my heart. if you enjoy adventure, or just cliches, pick this game up when it is on sale. mods make it enlessly replayable as well. 11/10",35.6
"a great rpg, since oblivion. i recommend to all my friends",1.9
"its ing skyrim, a time machine that only moves forwrd!!!",142.1
"the graphics are good. not really great, but good. the bad? its controled by steam. it needs internet connection to play. it is basicly imposible to complete main quest if you do random quests or random explorer before compleating the main quest because if you kill a charactor nessarry to the quest he will not be there when needed. end of game.start over.",553.4
"you havent known freedom, until you have run around a field collecting butterfly wings because thats what you wanted to do. you havent known badass, until you saunter up riding a dragon whilst hurling fireballs at people. you havent known epic, until you have fought two dragons at once on a frozen lake that is crumbling beneath your boots. you havent known class, until you have had fisticuffs with mud crabs wearing top hats and monocles. you havent known power, until you have went full liam neeson on bandits who have kidnapped your family. you havent known the atmosphere, until you have been hit by a giant at low level. you havent known frustrating, until you have had lydia block your doorway. you havent known an  kicking, until you have fought the ebony knight. you havent known drunk until youve stolen a goat from a giant, ran around the land naked and get married to a hag raven all in the same night with the god of debauchery. you havent known life until you have experienced skyrim. 10/10 would relive again.",48.3
"ive been having a problem getting the game to work so i thought ill open a support ticket and get some help. my first reply was rapid, within the day but from then on its taken longer and longer to get a response, after a while i got no reply and had to bump my ticket, got a reply saying the same thing as the guy before. so i did it regardless and re sent the info and i have jhad no reply...that was 2 months ago. i made a complaint a week ago and have had no acknolodgment of it since. as much as i love this game the hassle this is causing is not worth the cost iof it on firesale.",46.6
"literally one of the best video games of all time. easily in my top 5.",59.0

"great gameplay, great map, great story, one downside is bugs, would recommend it",61.2
"skyrim is a great addition to the elder scrolls series. as always theres loads to do, and the gameplay is much more fun and dynamic in skyrim than in previous titles. the world looks amazing, but the game lagged quite a bit for me, which killed my enjoyment somewhat. also, if you play this game a lot you can expect to run into balance issues, and it may start to become quite repetitive.",59.1
"soooo fun untill you completed every single dam part of the game like myself the only thing the game lacks is multiplayer then it would be the best game of all time!",325.9
"you probably have this game. if so, good for you, if not, whats wrong with you?! go slay some dragons already!",174.5
"best game ever it is very addicting but in a good way its not like most games where you are addicted but the game is boring its always fun and is definitely the best game i ever played.if you want this game make sure you get the dlcs that makes it 20 times better.i would rate this game 10/10.",143.0
"no elder scrolls game is about story. skyrim captures what the entire mission of the elder scrolls series is about: adventure. when youre walking on the road and bandits attack you, when you stumble upon a cave loaded with enemies and treasure, when you stay up through the late hours of the night because you dont want to go back to the real world, you know youre playing skyrim. the story driven quests are there to give you a general direction. the random encounters are there to make sure you take the longest route possible while going in that general direction.",123.5
"well... its skryim. the elder scrolls: skyrim. buy this game.",129.4
"soooo much fun! i really reccommend this game to annyone who is thinking about it. this is a great game soely judged by its superb graphics, but throw in an epic rpg with first and third person aspects, well, you can guess where im going with this. 9.8/10 ~dale",55.0
"you know you played this game long enough you start whistling the dovakin theme song when you pee",107.3
"fantastic rpg. absolutely love the free form exploration. now if only it had biowares character interaction and development. please note, this was the first elder scrolls game i got into. ive tired to play morrowind and oblivion but never clicked for me (although ill try again at some point).",215.5
"where should i start ? before i start the review i played this game over 5 times on the xbox360 but why did i buy it also on the pc well because of the mods dlcs and more that made me play this game another 3 times then i found out that skyrim is really easy to mod so yeah... i played even more until i also found a mod that you can level up till level 350 i had 700 hours but a bug happend and it rested all my hours so yeah.... want to play a game that literally endless replay ability well  this the game for you  man i got sucked into it more then a leech to a fat guy with diabetes 10/10 game of the years 2011 - 2014",58.7
"this is without a doubt the best game i have ever played. coupling my play time on steam and a rough estimate on my xbox ive racked up around 200 - 250 hours on skyrim, maybe more and i am not bored of it yet. the graphics, the storyline, the characters... its all so beautifully constructed, with the aid of the thousands of mods avaliable across the interwebs, and in most places beautifully written i cant help but keep going back to it time after time after time. my favourite part about skyrim is the dawnguard dlc. even though were dealing with vampires here (no spoilers intended) i find the storyline, in some parts, quite touching and overall it is something i think is 99% perfect. i would definitely recommend the elder scrolls franchise as a whole, and if you havent bought any of the games buy them right now and prepare to never go outside again.",162.5
"i could only take so much of this game. my interest soon turned to boredom, and im sick of watching people play skyrim. dont make me watch any more skyrim! that aside, many people enjoy this game more than i do, and i didnt mind dedicating a sizable chunk of time to this game.",37.9
"fus ro da!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! do you like magic, do you like adventuring, do you like skyrim then you should get it its a fun rpg game so fun i just fus ro da you and you went flying.",18.3
"many people complained about how skyrim really didnt change the formula from oblivion. my response? why fix what aint broke? oblivion worked just fine, though its system felt unpolished and generic. skyrim fixes those issues (barring a lot of (now fixed) minor bugs) and is well worth a play for fans of oblivion.",172.1
"i recommend this, it is awesome. best game ever by far.",463.7
"just an all out amazing game! with some of the best mods i have ever seen! :d",94.2
"rim jobs in the sky are too pornographic. this game should be banned.",70.8
"i see not a single reason not to love this game. best spent money ever. if you love rpgs and are familiar with bethesdas productions youre gonna climax while playing this game. also mods. must have for every tes nerd and even people who never played a single part of the series.",88.3
"i think skyirm is the best game i have ever played with the dlc or not",157.6
"does it even need to be said? this game is awesome. buy it now.",166.2
"you are less of a gamer if you have not played skyrim by now. 11/10 pros : great graphics, beautifully detailed landscapes. many side quests along with the main quest. countless hours of entertainment! (i guess it is counted hours of entertainment thanks to steam) cons : a lot of recycled voice acting, wonky horse mounts, even wonkier dragon mounts (dragonborn dlc) great game, lots of fun. if you disagree and think you could do create a better game, by all means, mod skyrim to your hearts content, the skyrim world is your oyster!",375.7
"fus ro da and youll love the game more than a fluffy dovakin",185.8
"the main story isnt that long and could be finished in less than 10 hours. however, it is the side quests which gives the game its length and makes it interesting. the good thing about the pc version is that if you screw up the skill tree or could not finish a quest because it is bugged then you can fix it by typing certain commands. crafting is so much fun and isnt that simple as several things could effect the outcome. the only downside to this game, well for me, is how the choices you make effect the outcome. if you are obsessed with knowing every possible outcome or finishing every quest then it becomes really annoying. i spent a lot of time reading guides to know is the outcome for each desicion, i really hated that. sometimes dungeons do get repetitive and annoying. id give it an 8/10.",316.5
"great visuals and mechanics but can get a bit repetitive.",8.0
"greatest game ever. mods make the game more amazing. suggest playing game first before modding. also best if playing with good gaming computer. you will never get bored playing this game. #amazing",99.0
"its skyrim... what more can you say besides one of the best if not the best single player game ever!",25.5
"seriously disappointed; severe lack of old people scrolling.",521.2
"amazing game. spent hour after hour on it and you still feel like your not even half way. the only problem it suffers is the amount of missions why out lasts the progression in terms of weapons and your character. you quite quickly get to a point where you can kill everything very easily. the weapons are also very limited for such a massive game. they are about 15 to 20 weapons which only change depending on the level of skill they have been crafted and what they have been crafted from. the only other problem i have from it is it is so vast of a game it seems very be littling when you first start. when i first began i honestly had no idea what to do to progress in the game or how to do things people had been telling me where good parts of the game. some may find it a good thing you have to figure out everything in the game but for me i missed too much which annoyed me. overall however an amazing game which deserves at least a 9/10 and you most certainly get your moneys worth. can easily clock up 100 or even 200 hours which rivals a good call of duty game. you will never ever ever want to replay this however unless you are a totally dedicated fan. you lose way too much pressing new game.",75.1
"if you dont have skyrim then get out from under your rock and play this.",145.9
"such an amazing game even just with the vanilla version, however with mods on pc the options are endless!!! even at full price this game is well worth the money, but on sale this is a no brainer to buy. also very much worth it to check out the dlc.",1218.3

"right reviewing the latest from the elder scrolls aka skyrim, well i have played over +500 hours of this game and i have done probably 10-15 playthoughs of it. so much to do, see, experience, and, learn in this game. i havent played any of the dlc for it but im definately planning on getting all of it in the next steam sale. one of the truely awesome things about this game is the ability to mod the heck out of it, right now i have probably 50-60 plugins running with it as well as about 20 mods, everything from making chichens explode to adding jedi and sith races to it, and it has taken an immersive, fun game and turned it into something i will probably never get tired of playing, i purchased this in a steam sale a while back and have never regretted it probably one of my best buys on here! if you are thinking of modding this game (excluding visually enhancing mods which you should definately add btw) i would wait until you have played though it once just to get the baseline experience of the game then go to town with mods. dont really have a lot of time to go into and indepth review of the fasets of this game but in short: base game: story 9/10 audio 7/10 visual 8/10 gameplay 8/10 replay value 8/10 overall 8.2/10 base game w/ addons story 10/10 audio 9/10 visual 10/10 gameplay 10/10 replay value 10/10 overall 9.8/10",698.9

"this game is very good if you have time to put into it. it is very action packed and makes you think. there is a hug world of modding to make it better. and remember stormcloaks are the best!!!",313.4
"this game, is so much fun! from just running around killing things, to downloading mods turning dragons into thomas the tankengine. if you liked any of the other elder scrolls then you will hands down love this game just as much if not more!",177.2
"thriving modding community keeps the game alive even after 3 years of its initial release. makes up for the fact that most of the quests are just generic go there kill that fetch this errands.",50.0
"this is one of the best rpg games ive ever played. 9/10",35.2
"this game is like having sex with a beutiful woman that has wings and is flying you through the eye of a hurricane",129.6
"in the early days of cinema there where a variety of movies that capitalized on low cost special effects, skyrim borrows a lot from these types of films. by shouting at enemies, and even goats, you make them stumble backwards as if by magic. this isnt revealed to you until youre half way through the game and told by mysterious shouting from atop a mountain that you must trek up the mountain and meet these shouters. youre then tasked with saving the world, again, and the most critical choice of the entire game comes after youve actually completed the game. time travel is involved, and theres plenty of goofy throwbacks to horrible movies in the form of a vampire den full of well-to-do vampire lords who thrive for thousands of years doing things that should have gotten them taken out a millenia ago. to join the thieves guild you simply walk into town with any loot in your inventory. keeping with tradition, bethesda has one animator and combat involves clicking until things die and nothing more. features such as crafting spells where replaced to make room for dlc for your xbox.",191.0
"i shot a goat up the  from like 5 miles away, it died in slow motion and made a funny noise. 10 / 10",56.0
"this game is simply amazing and it has soul, the art style, music and character models make skyrim the most spectacular experience so far in terms of a living world to explore. skyrim is not so much an rpg as it is an adventure simulator.",28.2
"a great open world rpg. best part about it, in my opinion, is the ability to mod the game. there is so much added replayability thanks to the huge and active modding community.",3.9
"skyrim. a huge world left for you to explore, and by you, i mean the character you create. there are many choices in that aspect. spanning over 200 hours of gameplay, there are quests, dungeons, enemies, and vast beautiful landscapes for you to explore. the class system isnt linear. there isnt even a class system! you choose as you want, and use what equipment you desire. skyrim meets the bars of the highs and allows for the players to do as they wish. skyrim is the ultimate rpg, of which it defines.",118.8
"i could write alot about this game but i wont but originally i have played 1,000+ along wiht my steam time becuase i didnt have this with steam beuase i had no clue what it was but this game is in my top 5 of my favorite games of all time due to its excellent stories and wide variaty of weapons, creatures, potions and even more so if you dont own this game, what are you doing?! buy it!",118.8
"i used to have a social life, but then i look an arrow to the knee.",243.9
"this game has ing dragons so its ing cool as  play this  now!!!!!!!",204.6
"with a beautiful world and a bunch of hype for the game, you wonder what went wrong. gameplay mechanics stale and boring and a poor engine to show case the game, allong with a crappy story and fetch this and that side quests, makes this game a boring ride to the park.",46.2
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim; as a new player, i envy your privilege to experience this game as a new. immediately you are placed into the vast ruthless expanse of skyrim, located at the far north of tamriel, skyrim is a country occupied by an old-world society with in-depth political opinions and standings. each npc is convincing in terms of realism and pragmatism and thus the game achieves immersion. the world is unchained and wild, filled with dangers, wonders and a beautiful northern environment. in terms of mechanics skyrim lacks noticeable flaws; the combat system is satisfying and grants the player a sense of overwhelming power once it comes to battle; the soundtrack aiding the effect greatly. composed by jeremy soule and appending to the atmosphere. freedom of the player remains uncompromised, allowing you to approach the game as you please and providing an individualistically adapted experience to each. the narrative is acceptable with a clear equilibrium, disequilibrium and re-equilibrium. a direct link the to the fantasy world is present and it doesnt fail to provide the expected codes and conventions which are demanded by the customer. overall i would recommend this product to any individual.",64.5
"the dragons are coming back to skyrim and you are the only one that can stop them, you are dragonborn. though the dragons arent the biggest concern because skyrim is in the middle of civil war the high king has been murdered you must choose a side, will you support ulfrick stormcloack and his rebel army or will you join (the far superior) imperial army. there are a lot of other side- and main quests in the game as wel. bethesda has nailed it again by producing a game that in my opinion is the king of rpgs. 9/10",170.1
"not sure what else can be said about this game that hasnt been said already but i loved it. definitely try it out if you havent already! + countless hours of entertainment + beautiful world full of lore + freedom -/+ ooo whats that? a cave? (never get anything done, because theres so much to do) - npcs dont have much depth - annoying creatures (a dog i shall not name)",120.4
"the first time i played skyrim it was around december of 11. a family member had brought it over and i thought these graphics are amazing, i dont deserve to have access to this. with the right mods to flesh out the game, skyrim can be right up there with morrowind. if your pc can handle it, i say give it a shot.",34.0
"amazing game, both as a singular game and as a continuation of the eder scrolls series.",373.6
"slaugthering dragons by shouting is totally badass! a must have game. 20/10",117.4
"awesome game if you like modding after the story is all but done and all the additional content available from the community... one of the best games i have ever played. this will bring you many hours of fun...",338.6
"its okay for awhile, gets boring later on. got to mod it for the real fun.",119.0
"not going to make this long because i could go on for days about how amazing and truley enjoyable this game is, it has always been my favorite game of all time ever since it came out. there is so much to do with never-ending quests that include and extreamly elaborate story line. 10/10 hands down !",41.4
"its potentially one of the best games ever made, but you already know that and are probably just on this page for amusing jokes. 10/10 needs more dragons",13.5
"the best rpg game ever. +you can experiment with workshop.",30.9
