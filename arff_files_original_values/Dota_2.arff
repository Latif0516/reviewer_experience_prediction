"the game itself is good, had a lot of fun. but the problem with this game is that u are too much dependable on the people u get with you in matchmaking. apparantly you have too much people who want to play carry, and then fail at it, what results in a waste of time. it usually starts already a hero selection. people dont communicate, only play what they want to play and usually lacks of teamplay when the game is busy. too bad, because the game itself is good, the community is for 80% flamers, egotrippers, wannabe carry players, very rude",754.9

"dota 2 is the most enjoyable moba i ever played. the updates getting good every day, tournaments and other shows are worth to watch. its good only if you know how to use character you playing with. + graphics + many tactics and strategies (only for smart peoples. :p ) + detailed heroes + great community. + fun to play with party of friends + very good hero balance (you will know if you play) + diverse hero sounds + easy to learn, difficult to master. + increase in servers letting you play in good ping. - very hard for beginners - you will face opponents who have played game over 1k hours. - takes time to learn each hero and ability and find your preferred hero among them. still cant figure out how to jump. :p",245.0

"an accurate representation of pubbing in this game would be to imagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life, each turd represents an average public game. now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar, it is the best feeling in the world. that chocolate bar represents those occasional games where everyone is evenly skilled and tastes so good that you continue eating turds just hoping for that next chocolate bar.",1930.7

"a combination of great game mechanics and compelling hero backstories make dota 2 a cut above other multiplayer online battle arenas (mobas) such as league of legend and dota 1. of particular interest to new and old players alike is the hero mirana and her trademark w-button ability, sacred arrow, which when successfully deployed is often considered one of the most fatal not-ulti moves in the game. when not utilising this 360-damage 5-second stun, players may take solace in miranas other special abilities such as leap, a devastatingly evasive jump, starstorm, a powerful aoe magical damage dealer, and her notorious ultimate moonlight shadow which will render all heroes on miranas team invisible at the click of a button. whilst dota 2 does not necessarily revolve around the ever-popular hero mirana at this time, many hope to one day see her in an online action/adventure of her very own.",963.7

"its a great game. i highly recommend it because of the amount of variety. it gives you over 50.. no.. over 100 combinations of characters and items to use in battle. in dota 2 you rely both on strategy and strength, and in some cases, even teamwork. but there are some few drawbacks, for example, theres only 1 map and finding an online game in some regions takes several minutes. ( or at least, that is my case ). but still, the design of characters, effects and models, compared to the ones from dota 1, are fascinating. i really like the new heroes look. plus, its not like you really have to pay for useful weapons and items. you can buy things in-game, in map shops to strengthen your hero, and even your team. i really give this game a high ranking!",20.4

"dota2 is something more than a game. it is a test. but that let my comment put you off. what lays under this very intricate, complex game is and experience you wont get anywhere else. it raises the bar on teamwork in multiplayer games. because without teamwork youll surely fail. and that is something a lot of multiplayer games try and fail with the self appointed hero player trying to show off. each member, including the npc are important. the controls, the interface will be daunting and put most people off, like me for instance. because the game itself is instense from the get go! but once you get use to the heroes you can play as, the lingo and system, that instensity that put you off, will drive you. dota2 is more than just a game, its a sport. and with all sports, you can make a great hobby out of it. you can have great fun. or you can go pro. oh! and its free!!! give it a go and dont be put off.",101.1

"well, i used not to enjoy mobas at all, the first moba i tried it was dota 2 because (valve games are always awesome, every single one of them) but because also, i heard good things about it, so for beginers in this kind of game its really hard to learn the basics, but once you learn you just want to play more and more and always try different heroes, tatics and such. so all the time i spent on it, it was well worth it. the only problem is that begginers tend to have a really bad matchmaking stats, and you find leavers, etc etc. but for people who are on the same level as me or better, its great. so why not give it a try?:)",1333.9

"if youre looking for a reason to commit time to dota 2  if youre actually reading this review for advice and a critical opinion, rather than to see what score im going to give the most popular game on steam  then, first up, thanks for being here. second, i want you to consider what it means when two grown men accidentally lather each other in regenerative goop. its gamings equivalent of holding a door open for somebody who is already reaching to hold the door open for you: a synchronicity of kindness that speaks to a deeper shared understanding of the situation both people are in. dota is a game where you can say the words are you thinking what im thinking? and be reliably assured that the person on the other end of your voip connection actually is. it might have the systems and bearing of a videogame, but dota shares the social impetus of a sport. its single environment isnt a map, its a pitch.",3000.6

(no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",2758.9

"a 6 or 7 line review just wont do this game justice. dota 2s learning curve is pretty steep but once you learn the basics, which can take 5 to 15 matches, its rewarding experience thats all about teamwork and playing your role correctly. dota 2s social features are cutting edge and designed for great casual, hardcore and competitive play. the controls are tight and responsive while dedicated servers on multiple locations allow for almost no noticeable latency. its free to play but people wont use their wallets for tactical advantage because all items are purely cosmetic. really impressive game and my personal game of the year 2013.",1263.8

"it is an amazing game but there are two very negative points about it. one of them, and the most prominant one, is the lack of optimization for the mac version. the mac version, simply put, sucks. it does not do justice that this version is so incredibly buggy on the osx operating system. plus, when moving the camera on the top part of the display when in full screen on osx, the game glitches as it is invoking the status bar.",4.8

"kinda good game but if you are not playing in the us servers then you will have mostly worse games, well... depending on your matchmaking level some community members dont know how to select languages that they accually speak, for example: i only choose english language, then some russian people choose russian language+english language> accept game> start arguing with people that say: please dont matchmake in english language if you cant accually speak english. valve should fix this by making some language quiz that you have to do before you can even start queueing anyways, i love this game, cheers!",1078.4

"a dynamic system to entertain the mind, train your brain/memory, enjoy great pvp and develop leadership, teamwork, foresight, calculation and prediction skills. a varied cast of characters each with their own skill set and a wide range of items to help with customization of the way you want to play. an interesting community ranging from great, co-operative players and impressive enemies, to the lowest gamer quality which require you to develop patience and restraint. if you consider picking this game up, remember, there is a high learning curve, therefore you must be prepared to fall and rise again in the never-ending battle between the dire and the radiant. good luck, have fun",1086.0

"honestly there is a massive learning curve for the new players, but valve is constantly adding features to make the game and its concepts as accessible to the public as possible. the fact that it is free leaves it all up to the player to decide whether the game is for them; nothing is stopping you from trying it out. but for those who are already into this genre of gaming, im not going to sugarcoat our community, there are positives and negatives to every aspect of social interaction in this game. you prefer what you prefer, but the game is stellar for me.",1770.5

(no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",2758.9

"highly addictive moba based off warcraft 3 and massively updated by valve. the game play is very well tuned with balance updates pretty regularly. the patches are worth looking forward and the free-to-play model is brilliant. that said, this game has one of the worst gaming communities i have ever been a part of. utterly shocking behaviour almost every game by at least one player. this game painfully needs a ban list to avoid being with these people more than once. bring friends for the best experience.",2032.8
"so far best moba game ive played, hardcore and not very newbie friendly",2043.9
"for me it is like a daily routine to play and compete against players across the world. not just we share our views but also our intellects collide on the same battlefield to determine the wave of glory for teams playing each round. sometimes we win but we loose which really makes to see deep in our hearts where we need the fear to be controlled and our reflexes on time through the game any time any place. at last it made us a way better than we happen to be in our previous game. understanding and reasoning the events of game is the most key factor if u really need to make best out of your effort. this game really changed us more than just one way.",3186.9

"its is a very good game with good balancing and intersting abilities, but as you probaly read before, you can compare the communitie with a waste bin. people will just scream at you when you do someting wrong and leave the game after that and dont forget the famous mid or feed strategy. communication in this game is hard, the game does it good at that point, but then the russians and arabians or whatever show up when you clearly clicked eu-west and that you want to meet up with english people instead of other language. so yeah, game is perfectly with regulary updates and interesting events, but the communitie really needs to get better (i mean a lot better) or valve should just link english people with real english people and auto search for the best server instead of choosing the server. i would say 9.5/10 for the game (nothing is perfect) and 2/10 for the communitie (sometimes you meet a nice person)",850.8

"at first i thought that mobas in general were terrible, i played the dota 2 tutorial and played ten matches then uninstalled the game. i really didnt like playing the game because every time i played i was shouted at and put in low priority. about a year later after my friends insisted that i play i started afresh and managed to quickly find my feet and dota 2 is now one of my favourite all time games. the steep learning curve makes dota 2 hard to get into but after you start understanding tactics and mastering characters it becomes an amazing game. the hundreds of characters, items, playstyles, etc. make every game fresh and exciting. if you manage to make your way out of the (noob/pinoy) bracket of players then suddenly the game opens up with possibilities and becomes one of the best games that i have ever played. it will keep you entertained for years and years.",398.2

"the game is okay, but i am naturally a reflexive gamer, not a strategy gamer. so in an fps gamers point of view, this game is fun but gets boring really quick. takes a long time to get to the action, but the action barely lasts 10 seconds (unless you have a tp scroll or whatever its called). variety of characters is good. but i find that one map gets really boring. some might disagree with what i say. heck, a lot of people will disagree with what i say, especially considering the kind of community this game has. majority of them are uncooperative, unhospitable, or trolls. all in all, good game, just doesnt really catch my interest, and horrible community. this game is only fun if you have friends to play with.",18.7

"it is a really good fantasy game with lots of fighting. although it is simple click and attack fighting style the variety of moves there are really makes up for that. if i could rate it out of 10 i would give it a 7.5. i recommend it.",9.0
"this is a good game, however i dont like the concept of being paired with noobs. it totally ruins the game, you play with people that is not in the same skill level and you tend to lose more than to win most of your games. you should change the way how your system finds a match for an individual it should be people who win will be paired with people who win, and those who lose alot play amongst themselves. i cant believe that when you go solo match there are people who are in a party? whats that about? i believe that you can never learn common sense, you are born with that talent. you should hire developers that have common sense if you want this game of yours appreciated by dota2 and non dota2 players. most likely if non dota2 players find the enviroment in that kind of manner i believe that this game will be undisputedly number 1 in rtsgaming",1681.6
