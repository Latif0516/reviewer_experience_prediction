"i cut a robot in half, decapitated that half and cut his arms off. 10/10",6.5
"a very fun and addicting game with a fair and mostly balanced f2p microtransaction model. you can play this game entirely for free and experience all of its content for free. the only exception being that the only worthwhile things to obain using ereal money are slot for weapons and warframes.",660.5
"whats that, you dont have this game? oh no it isnt a probelm... :( 10/10 gobsmacking now wheres the removal of friendship button...",36.6
"this game, without a doubt, has the flaw of being a f2p game but without all the constraints that most games under the same genre have today. nearly every thing can be attainted without the need to prchase the in-game currency, aside from select cosmetic and certain event mods. the only gripe is how many warframes and weapons one person can hold in their arsinal at once, which is gained by using platinum. it can be pretty easy to earn the in-game currency once you get going, as people will always be seeking out rare mods and prime parts. you can even gain some platinum from the daily log in! the developers also seem to frown upon buying credits with platinum, as 90 platinum is only 30,000 credits, which will not last long what-so-ever, and they know this.",349.4
"quite possibly the best free to play game ive ever played. stunning visuals, smooth gameplay, excellent combat system and gear selection. i highly reccomend this.",103.9
"this game is one of the best out there and iam not just saying that. warframe is a freeto play game that you can earn everything that other people pay for with hard work no spending 20 bucks to get a little pony to ride and the game is not bout geting more monney for there community its fun and realy kick but.one of the frist thing i loved about this game was how you can move in and and the ways you look when doing it its just awsome and its a game that i think is realy out there and is only going to get more players in on it. well thats a nice little picce of what i think so i think its good so the lst thing to say is dont take my word or the words of tons and tons of players its free to play so there is nothing stoping you from trying warframe to day!!! so clike play game and see you later hopefully in game tenno.",141.2
"a very good games. it has a lot of potential but it is ruied by a none fluid gameplay and of course a pay to win systeme 6/10",1.7
"one of the best games ive ever played. perfect space ninja game. i give it 44 out of 6 space potatoes.",187.2
"by far and wide one of the greatest and best free games you can get right now, try it out! do it! you wont regret it!",128.4
"it is a alright game if you are ok with the repetetive farming",43.3
"not a bad third person shooter, considering its free its quite good. takes a long time to get things i.e. you have to get matierals and then wait real time for them to build(any where between 1 hour and 24 hours. none the less it has alot of content and is fairly good. 7/10",49.2
"best game ever , there are space ninjas in it 11/10",479.2
"extremely enjoyable coop experience. even being in beta, it offers more fun than a lot of other games. small amount of maps can make it a bit repetitive, but slicing enemies in half or punching them to the moon never gets old.",644.8
"this game is terrible. i really dont understand how people can even play this game, or why it has such a large following, becaue it is truly a gpos (giant piece of ). anyone who plays this game, and is on my friends list, please do me the favor of removing yourself from it.",0.8
"a great game. fast-paced with a lot of features. its a lot better with friends, though; playing solo is just boring, monotonous grinding. to be fair, the whole game is a giant grind for materials, but they keep it interesting. its totally free, but you can pay (and to be fair, when you pay its more expensive than working for your gear!) to have everything go faster. the devs keep the game up-to-date and theres a whole damn lot of content to get engulfed in. in short, this game is the love child of destiny and metal gear rising, directed by jj abrams. just... seriously. i love this game even after a few days of playing. get it. do it.",207.6
"this is a great game but the developers dont listen to, acknowledge or respond to their community. its like they have taken a great concept, then focused on aggressively creating situations for players to pay as much money as possible. this is f2p tactics obviously, but digital extremes take it to the extremes... : generally f2p games have some level of balance, and a great example of this would be planetside 2. this and ps2 arent pay2win games as people complain, but they are pay 4 convenience. the issue is that de focus on making this game as inconvenient as possible, and the only way to avoid any inconvenience is to pay money continuously and forever. the more you progress into this game, the more inconvenient it gets (youd think the opposite). the aggressiveness of the push to spend money by de is not really apparent until around the 100 hours mark of playing. i beleive the push to make you spend is becuase there is no end game. what you do at the start is the same at the end. if your only a casual player, then this game is a lot of fun and especially so with friends. if you get invested in games then this will likely become compulsion, rather than fun. its such a shame, because its a great game. but the unethical business model and a clear lack of direction ruins it. in the end, this game punishes you for player more of it.",309.4
"what more to say, it is free. this is one of those games that has a sbit of a learning curve (when it comes to the skills and ablilties) but overall, if very enjoyable. especially with a few friends.",3.7
"i have had problems with games that are too repetitive in the past. this is one such game and while it was fun the first few hours it has become much too repetitive after a while. i dont like to grind for hours at end and thats the one reason i have stopped playing the game. otherwise this game deserves at least a 9/10.",2.4
"really this is a cool game. i guest it has a good story. and its fast to play. but just realize your playin a crappy hack and slash grindy game for noobs. i know in this game you get a whole bunch of items at the start but what did you do? practicle noobcakes..... nothing!!! back when you werent noobs when this game was good you would actually have to work. but instead you can just noob-out! grinding was good back then about 1-2 years ago cause you werent grinding for flipin warframes and weapons, you get materials and you know what you do with those materials....... newbs just cant answer this in about 10 seconds. you for cry out loud build yo gear! this game was good back but not worth your time now a days... youre just sad why waste your time?",2.9
"its a pretty good game, its smooth, yet you can get lost easily, it has alot going for it in the player clan department like designing your own dojo is nice. ever sense i first started in update 3, so much has changed, its harder, and confusing. but easy to get the hang of, i reccomend using a controller to play this game. only flaw i truly see with this game is the fact it takes forever to build any of the gear in this game",95.9

"disclosure: i havent played this game for 20+ hours. as far as free to play games go, especially on steam, this one seems leaps and bounds better in controls and just plain fun. graphically the environments can be too repetitive and not really look as good as they should, but the character models and especially the animations are just fantastic. one of my bigger complaints is that the cluttered environments sometimes make it hard to pull off all of the most fun stunts, like wallrunning while mowing down grineers around you. unfortunately while i think the gameplay beats many free-to-play games, the cash shop is pathetically stingy. this is a game where they want you to pay for everything - be aware that the first tenno you choose will be the only free one you get! even the other starters frames will cost you, and the conversion rate is unforgiving. i honestly think theyd get more money if their prices were more reasonable; im sure im not the only player who wouldnt mind throwing down money occasionally if the reward justified the price.",57.3
"space ninjas play for free. free to play defines this game extremely well. the fact that most ftp games are pay to win, this game is the exact opposite. this game is play to win. sure you can spend money and buy things, but you can literally unlock everything (except for colors, slots, and aesthetic features) in game. there are items in game that you have to play to unlock, you cant buy everything. the play style of warframe is amazing, its pve with groups of four. sure you can run solo, but its a lot more fun to play with groups. the beginning is somewhat slow, but once you hit around the third planet and you figure everything out, this game is simply amazing. the graphics are breath-taking, i could go very in-depth about this game, but ill let you decide if you enjoy it or not. just think about this one phrase, space-ninjas.",434.4
"blew 100 hours of my life on this game. i am out of money. 5 stars.",320.1
"free to play done right. none of the hey you need to give us all your money before you can really play garbage. this is just a really great, fast paced shooting game with an interesting and complex upgrade system. the developers get you to pay money because its a great game, not so you can actually play the full game. at no point did i ever feel i had to spend money. definitly check it out. its free after all.",86.7
"gets kinda repetative but the combat is fun. good to play for a short time.",220.7
"to tell you the truth i cannot stand this game. like i see people saying its the best game ever and how its a landmark in free to play games. but all it does is just rehash all that is wrong in the genre. first off i will admit the game is ing pretty. the reflections and lighting especialy. but the gameplay feels bland and asks way to much from the player. some of the more advanced manuvers are just ridiculous. try pressing the control key while holding shift. and i hate games like this that dont scale the difficulty properly for single-player. i mean if i have no freinds dont penalize me. overall the game is just grindy. like its the whole point of the game. the idea of mastery levels are explained terribly. but hey if you like grinding one level over and over to get a certain material go ahead.",32.7
"warframe is a mixed bag for me. its graphics are amazing, character design is well created and combat is fast paced,each warframe has its own speacial abilities, styles and customization. however i found myself becoming quite bored of the repettitive gamplay and maps, im not sure exactly why but it just felt rather lacking....also when firing my guns it was rather dull, i didnt feel any kick from it and it was like holding a pea shooter doing minimal damage (yes i have tried the various types of weapons, the saloon cowboy style twin pistols being my favored choice). trying to get new warframes is also rather time consuming, the player having to complete different zones to get components (some which you wont unlock till a higher level) with a high chance of not aquaring what you wanted. however i did expect this from a f2p game. money is the easier root to get cooler stuff, luckly this is a co-op game because it is on the verge of buy to win. so to wrap it up in short i would recommend this game since its f2p, its enjoyable and fun but be ready to sink alot of time into it if you are not willing to pay.",59.5
"if you love farming simulator 2013, youre gonna love this.",845.8
"best game i ever played ever thats free...no really",450.0
"warframe, a game in which you are farming more than you do on farming simulator. 10/10",197.5
"this game is extremely stupid. it wont even let you start the game, so you open it and it says play click that and screen turns black. d:",0.8
"im writing this in my first 68 hours and i dont think ill change my review in the future. i am a gamer that still owns a potato-pc, and when i saw the graphics i was amazed that first of all, i could play it, adjust the settings to low and run it flawlessly with just 2gb ram. the storyline is awesome, even though it is divided in quests - which take some time to get them. the third-person view was something that i liked and gave a different look than all fps games today. even though in missions i seemed to forget it, there are many ways to parkour your way up a wall, or screw gravity and run on the wall to reach a higher ground, which i havent seen in any other game. many people say the game later on gets harder and requires more grinding. i agree, there is the grinding part in the game, but thats for every freetoplay game. if you, for example worked hard on a game and published it for free, wouldnt you like to earn some money out of your hard work - perhaps to keep the servers your gamers use? back to the main point though, if any of you have played spiral knights - i was a big fan of it once - you know that the warframes grinding is no match to the spiral knights one. no, im not trying to avoid the grinding matter by providing games with the same technique, but grinding in warframe felt more rewarding for me, and sometimes even fun (in defence or survival missions, the void. . .).",112.6
"great game fast paced incredable fights an all round great game",39.5
"excellent game, mixing maths with graphics into an art form. free to play and definately not pay to win, a good model for future f2p gamers to look up to.",1065.2
"omg why i dont know this awesome game from a long time my friend recomeded this for me and i sayed it will be just like others but now this game is the #1 in my game list ps : i am a youtuber with 120 subs i need someone with skype to make a video on this awsome game ps #2 : sorry for my bad english i am french lol",7.2
"i have oberon and enjoy the game because is easy for me when i use my ulti wave or map is clear :d i love warframe & dota2 notice = > :::::(dont go phobos planet more because , 3 brother come and ing u )::::: good luck",400.2
"this is a great game for the die-hard ninjas that are out there slice and shoot em all",2.3
"i didnt find it interesting. ran into a couple glitches too.",13.7
"ing awesome game. if you dont play this, youre a dickmonger!?",164.1
"the controls are strange, the voice acting is mediocre, its a free-to-play title, and there is absolutely no backstory explanation whatsoever. skip this one.",0.7
"awesome game...hard to get into sort of like dota 2 in that way... the biggest con is that its repetitive.",60.8
"this game makes me cry in a corner about my life...",1094.5
"i totally ask people to try this game out if you havent try it yet it a cool game you get to but weapon get warframes but you need to collect iteams to build the weapons..",23.0
"good game & great game developers. ive play this game since theres nothing fishy. and while i played this game for the main game, i see lots of updates! game dev team are so great, more of bugs fixed, many thing updates not only the weapons.",585.8
"a hoarders paradise. all the space ninja with special powers goodness you could want.",130.3
"linear, but fun. game is easy to understand, better with friends, and has a pretty cool upgrade system. i havent paid a dime and i do not feel obligated to.",6.9
"i can, without a doubt, certainly say, that warframe, is okay. better than most tps/co-op games out there, plus its f2p, so its worth it. but, its still only okay. great with friends, but otherwise... dont bother. get friends to play with you or dont play at all.",0.3
"this game looks fun, but, its not. number 1. laggy for people with macs, number 2. you have to push 1 2 3 and 4 to use powers. and you cannot change it. number 3. hard.",24.4
"its a beautiful game! its hard to explane because its that good! love it! <3<3<3<3<3<3<3!!!!! would recommend!",14.2
"this is a good game if you want some ninja skills and abilities mixed with a splinter cell type game!",62.9
"too much updates. but it is still an ok-ish game 5/10",1.0
"this game will be fun for you for the first 2 hours, and then you will notice that its the same 3 maps over, and over, and over, and over again. also, the business model is the most pay to ing win ( or lazy and finish the game ) i have ever seen.",10.5
"the animation guy is earning his pay. every animation looks incredible. the only other game with animations this smooth is dark souls.",61.1
"its free, so uhh... i gues thats a good reason to get it",3.3
"a game in which you have to be tested to level up? and you can only take the test once every 24 hours? the very concept offends me. from the time i was a kid until i was in graduate school, i was tested every damn week. the jobs we normal everyday humans have, every couple months there are tests, competency exams, certifications exams...i want escape from the mundane, not a replication of it in a game. we cant escape this for even a minute, it has to be inflicted on us in a damn game? the people behind warframe, there is something seriously wrong in their heads if they think this is a good idea. and if a player ever puts up with this nonense, theres something seriously wrong in their heads, too.",11.3
"its like halo just mixed with cool, card-collecting upgrades that is better for the pc. it has a lot of potentiel as long as they keep the fixes constant.",173.7
"really good game to break from others, but get boring really fast; um jogo muito bom para quebrar a mesmisse porem fica tedioso bem rapido.",241.5
"honestly, this is one of the best game s ive played a long time! on any normal day i probably wouldnt like this game, because it looks confusing and complicated. but! this game does a good job describing it and you will get used to thew controls in a heartbeat. all around it is a verry good game!",476.5
"amazing game, very very good game!!!!! if you like star wars, guns & swords, aliens and alot of action, this game is perfect to you!!!!!!! i highly recommend this game to anyone like the thing upp here!!!!! and the best of it, its free@@ <3333 but you have to pay if your gonna buy things to the game (in-game) and so long... get it!, ure gonna lov it!",82.9
"liking this game for me, basically boils down to getting to be a damn space ninja. theres lots to love though. its got space robots, spehs mahreens, and violently infections space zombies. the game feel is great, theres lots of unique, interesting weapons, and cool stuff is always being added by the devs. best of all, its free. sure you can buy stuff with platinum, but the only thing you cant craft yourself is slots for frames and weapons. not only that, but the most sought after item (upgrade reactors/catalysts) comes out to a little over a dollar worth of platinum. i wont tell you that this game is perfect, because its not. i have had a lot of damn fun on it though, and i find myself coming back to this game more than others.",883.9
"great game! looks great, feels great, plays great. and still free. and finally coop !!! also the acorbatics in this game are amazing and fun! an must have game imo!",1280.7
"basically a free to play version of destiny, that came out before destiny. if you want a game thats fast paced & easy to play, and doesnt take allot of grind time to enjoy it then its worth the free install. but it is a typical console run and gun with a shinny appearance to hide the lacking of progressive storyline or variance in gameplay.",23.0
"this game is crazy insane and i would recomend this game to anyone who likes there games of stealth and there games of shoot em up!!!",242.8
"this game offers a fast pace, amazing graphics/effects, unique fighting style, customization, and much more. if you do not mind raiding stages (that can be similar at times) over and over again, then this game will be fun.",58.7
"graphically engaging, fastpaced, dungeon crawler-esque, rpg elements, and overall a good time. if youre looking for those things, look no further, and download warframe!",1.1
"your common p2w with a twist, it has space ninja shooting role based characters! with them, you can do anything! as long as its the same thing for about 2 years... play if you have nothing else to do (also comes with so much blur youll throw up!) 4.5/10",539.0
"this game blows f2ps out of the water with how much fun it can be. feel like playing a solo stealth game? check. feel like blowing up thousands of aliens trying to kill you with friends? check. feel like doing those things with tons of weapons and [easily] over a hundred missions? like a walk in the park for this game. the only downside that i see to this game is the lack of propper introduction and the pros and cons of each weapon, however this is easily dealt with early on in the game. not to mention this game is beautiful and runs like a dream on my rig. almost all items in the game can be obtained without paying real world currency. oh, by the way did i mention that you are an alien ninja? no? well you are. i cant wait to delve in further.",150.3
"get more powerful weapons so you can run more missions with to make those new weapons more powerful. unless you want to spend money: grindy and repetative to the extreme. i wish there was a way to pay money to make this game fun again after the first 20 hours of gameplay. its free to play though.",2.8
"this is an amazing game! i just wish my computer could handle it",395.6
"great f2p game. space ninjas can keep you entertained for a few hours without getting boring too fast.",4.3
"3rd person action space ninja dungeon crawler 11/10",198.3
"robo ninjas in space!!! wallrunning!!! shooting!!! melee!!!",648.0
"love this game! however, be warned, story has much to be desired and do not play too much as gets dull.",13.9
"brilliant, when i first saw warframe i thought it was one of the countless futuristic pvp shooting games, but when i tried it, in short, it has to be one of the best games iv played in a long while.",85.5
"this game, just, wow, one of my favorite games, the weapons, especially the sword is just so satisfying to use, 9.5out of ten deffinetly download this game.",54.6
"fantastic game! i love everything about this game from the brilliant rank progression system to the wonderful art direction.",5.1
"i play this on the ps4 and just wanted to leave a review on here. in short, yes it is a grind if you want to keep playing for free and still get good items, but it is highly addictive. where destiny was limited, short, sometimes too difficult and not that much fun for me, warframe makes up for it. warframe is basically a more feature rich version of destiny. however be warned, if you dont want to play for free, it is very expensive. some of the packages cost double that of a normal game, and buying in game credits is obscene. but, that hasnt mattered for me. ive won enough items and levels through grinding on free play to keep me interested. highly recommend.",0.1
"really great art style and backstory. its too bad the games missions are so repetative and adds nothing to the narrative of the interesting universe theyve created. the gameplay can be fun but youll be doing the same over and over. killing hundreds of grunt enemies and then the odd tougher boss.",74.8
"garrys mod?sure.loadout?definatly.warframe? yea es!",11.8
"what else can i say except that i am a big fan of warcreng",840.4
"just a warning to any one intending to invest time into this game. through my own personal experience i have now lost months of playing time and hundreds of dollars because this company decides it was ok to delete my acount with out my knowledge now ive been side linded in support for almost a week the customer service is digusting and respond with aditude toward its customers, this businesss practice is disgusting and unacceptable. so just a note if u plan on playing and spending money you do it at youre own risk",152.9
"one of best but weapon customisation needs it be something i know there are weapon card add on but im talking about physical changes to the weapon for example a sword can get a better grip increases speed and looks epic or aiming sights",27.9
"supposed to be a great game. but you really need to use real money for almost all items. its like you are imprisoned even if its ftp",14.8
"do you like ninjas what about robots lucky for you a freak accident combined them into robinjas play",131.7
"even if it is a bit of a grind, it is so much fun after the initial hour or two",232.6
"while this game looks great do not be fooled, these ninjas are subpar for any true dark warrior. kamas are fashioned with subpar material, nikanas obviously not shinobi-made and my mom found me playing this and grounded me.",191.2
"great game! fast paced, a lot of presonlization, and has a ton of potention in its open beta phase. sometimes a bit repetative, but it is a beta so its growing. highly recommend.",81.4
"i dont like the fact that in the update 14,(well in my experience of the update so far) kubrows die and i had wasted 80 platinum (currency). it feels very unsatisfying to know that i wasted money on this game. i want a refund",342.7
"played 0.1 hours and only seen the awesome looking main menu... 11/10 - would play again",0.7
"the gameplay is good but the whole buy a blueprint and then find more resources to compensate for making the item is very frustrating and time consuming. the game is the same mission over and over until you unlock more mission to play some more repetitive missions and enemies. the game is good but it just has to be for you.",4.8
"i think it is a beauiful game but the lag is crazy. as soon as i start a mission i lag, if they can reduce or stop the lag the game would be amazing on pc.",4.6
"fast gameplay, cool moves, and a cinematic experience. hell i dont even like third person shooters, but this is an exeption!!! a must have for hardcore gamers.",79.8
"you can split someone in half and shoot lighting and its free to play mormon jesus approved",27.6
"if you like futuristic games then this game is for you! its awsome!",480.5
"very entertaining co-op, and while still in beta, it delivers a very large amount of content. with the huge amount of customisation, both in appearances and functionality of frames and weapons, and even the ability to build something from the ground up, this game can keep you hooked for a long time. there are naturally, points in which it feels lacking for now, but digital extremes are obviously hard at work making this game better every moment they have. you can clearly see the amount of effort and love that are going into making this, and it seems that with every large update, the game just manages to become more aluring. there are quite a few approaches you can take on gameplay, especially concerning the weapons you choose. these can offer incredible diversity in playstyle, which one can further change according to their tastes, when it comes to customisation. the amount of mobility is also a great factor in this game, allowing you to perform a variety of acrobatic moves to get around, or even get the upper hand on enemies, if you know what youre doing.",652.2
"> get fist weapons > -punch and -punt aliens to get their lunch money > buy & build better fist weapons i am in space ninja heaven.",800.4
"this is a beautiful looking game and the gameplay is ok but it falls with almost everything having to be bought with money.",5.5
"this game is an amazing example of how a slight remix of an idea can explode in popularity and exellent gameplay. like stealth play? go for it, theres an entire 3 characters for it an a whole array of weapons. like running and gunning? go forth and slaughter to your hearts content. warframe is truly a game that shows that giving the player a large number of pointy objects and fleshy, blood filled targets can be the most fun in your life.",12.2
"space ninjas ! ! ! flippy flip, slash, pew pew pew !",74.9
"i love this game. especially with the new archwings, this game is fact-paced and fun to play. pumping a couple dollars into the game helps you move along faster, but this game is definitley not pay-2-win, and you can play the full game comepletey free. this game does get repetitive, so i would reccomend playing maybe a couple times a week.",200.5
"sometimes you just have to go in without looking at the situation and realize gee this is one big mess but on the other hand you have to say to yourself i can fix this and thats what you",15.3
"space ninjas in power armor. if you need anymore reasoning than that to give this game a shot then go play runescape or something.",8.1
"yes yes yes yes yeeeeesss!!!!! such a good game, you can really feel the atmosphere of your surroundings , the storyline is a bit typical, but the gameplay is astounding. outstanding graphics also really make the game, come to life. the voice acting, i could go on all day about it. its extremely well written and the actors appsolutally nail the emotions, and the voices fit perfectly with the characters. my overall opinion is that, this game is delight, and i would rate it 10/10",5.5
"really fun game to play !!!!just give it shot maybe youll like it!",4.8
"i played this some before and without having a lot of hours onto the game i can say it looks promising i know people who have played this to much for their own good. also i like the fact that unlike most mmorpgs where you do not really become badass untill you played for a long time here you are a flippin ninja from the start! cons: it is still an mmorpg which means it includes grinding which i am not a big fan of it can sometimes be unclear with where you need to go as with all games where you can fly around (not literary fly) you will get stuck. in general though i recommend atleast trying it :d",1.0
"i really didnt expect to enjoy this game as much as i did.the combat is fast paced and once you play into the game the difficulty definitly increases in a good way.the rpg elements have been implemented very well and the mod system seems very interesting. the only thing about the game i didnt enjoy is that for a new player i found it pretty difficult to figure out how to do certain things there are small tutorial hints in-game but i didnt find them as helpful as they could have been. overall i think everybody interested in an action/rpg/shooter hybrid should give warframe a try, and since its free to play that makes checking it out even easier. rating 8/10",693.9
"free to play. and evil with it (well, some of the design is questionable, at least). apparently its far less evil than the vast majority of ftp games. which is lucky, i guess, since theres a slick, if actually slightly dumb, shooter here to overshadow that cash shop. worth noting is the fact that random number generators feature so heavy that its not uncommon to hear this one refered to as warfarm or grindframe. its addictive and has absolutely no respect for your time. i should hate it, but i (judging by my hours played) kinda love it.",467.5

"its a 3rd person, space ninja multiplayer about killing monsters. put in a couple of sweet effects and spells and you have warframe, awesome.",84.1
"well your a person in a suits called warframes each warframe has its own set of abilities i go with loki it can go invisible to get past security and can switch places with the enemy so the enemy is confused as you could probally tell from the warframe picture it has guns and what every person needs to spill blood a sword which can be upgraded and you can get different melee weps mostly swords but there are power gloves that can be purchased which allow you to pack a punch(get it gloves and punching huh huh anybody?) any way download it its free",10.6
"im hooked on this game. highly recomended if you enjoy coop and third person missions. grindy, yes, but i think thats what i like about it. with the huge selection of weapons and frames, there is always something to strive for wether it be attaining that item you dont have, or leveling it to max it out.",799.5

"welp. the time has come for a review! pros- smooth gameplay awesome characters customizable tons of weapons new maps and characters added now and then(which is cool) beautiful graphics cons- you need to wait a little to build a new warframe, or a new weapon, but its ok! its worth waiting. and..thats all from my personal experience ._. died from shockwave moa bug, got shot down from grineer ballista, burned to crisp from grineer napalm.. ten out of ten would again die from all of these things, so i can revive, and kick their  back! good job.i recomment this game to anyone who likes 3rd person shooter with a lot of guns, customizasion, and gameplay.",159.5
"game is fantastic! loot based mission structure that rewards you for how well you play similar to monster hunter, torchlight or boarderlands. extremely fun multiplayer tactics avalible and the game has a very high skill ceiling. early game is a bit of a grind though, you may find higher levels extremely difficult without a close nit team and the public team joining service is not totally realiable. also- dont get the steam version! steam sucks! get the stand alone game at",10.8

"ill break it down for ya. a. this game looks sexy. peirod b. you play a cyber space ninja... thing. c. its f#ckin free d. a+ game design, sound, and writing. e. its f#ckin free!!!! so if your comp. doesnt explode on install, give it a shot its pretty awsome. mallers rating: $-$-$-$-$-$-$ 7/10 maybe a 8 if you like grafics more than solid gameplay foot notes: - not open world, quest based gameplay -multiplayer usaly 4 players permisson -lots of customisation -updated twice since i started playing 2-3 weeks ago ( not bad for free to play) -mic enabled but not commanly used -best played with a controler ive read 360 and ps3 work the best (wall running and other crazy  moves you can pull off are tough with a keyboard) -this game will work your grafics card over like a red headed stepchild unless you turn down the settings... or if your rich enough to buy a beast one, which i am not :( -join or make a clan, makes the game better + you get a dojo son,",39.3
"i only played for 15 minutes. the intro and one mission. then i was left to try and figure out where to go next and for some reason, everything was locked off and i couldnt go further and tbh, i couldnt care to go further. if you enjoy it, great... but i found it to be esoteric and terse, which is not a very good feeling to have by a new player. maybe in the future, when i feel like checking it out, i will google some video tutorials on youtube but not tonight.",0.7

"it was all fun and all when i first started playing this game. however after a couple of hours here and there, i feel like i have lost my passion to like this game. the only thing thats keeping me to play is the aesthetic look and the graphics. everything feels like a grind fest and its just seems so ridiculous you have to wait 12-24 hrs for an item you are building. the only way to get around this is if you use plats to speed up the process. :(",98.0

"although ive never played warframe on pc i played hundreds of hours on the ps4 (i hope theres no real differnce) and i must say for a free game warframe is amazing you will spend countless hours even alone on this game something this game did very well was how many things you can do you can work on making a warframe, weapon, something for the clan, etc. all in all this is my first review so its  and short but at least i tried",3.9
"warframe, where do i start? with all of its grindiness, it can get repititve at times. however with its unique custimization options, variety of missions and warframes. it all makes up for it, the amount of time the creators of this game is noticeable, with balance changes, new weapons, etc. warframe is defiantly a fun time, playing solo, or with friends. so defiantly try this game out, grab a few friends as well, start a clan! the platinum prices however could be alittle lower, my wallet is in pain.",234.1

"for beginners i warn you, you will not understand where to go. but once you get used to the mission mechanics youll be able to get through the menus with ease. the one downside to this game is the crafting if you dont want to spend real money. all i have to say is have fun grinding the same mission over and over again if you want to craft something. but this game gets a 9/10 crafting being the -1, decide for yourself.",9.7
"what i felt about the potential about the game earlier doesnt matter,the game althought beautiful and generic yet confusing ui and system,i loved the gameplay;now i have deleted the game.what turned me off was that nothing in the game cannot be bought with the currency u earn in the game (by playing hours after hours)that is - credits;there is yet another currency-platinum(the real deal),unfortunately u cant earn tht by playing..> u need to spend real money!!and the price?how about 49$ for 500 plata,and in the marketplace u can buy only a few stuff with that much plats...not fair right?its f2p because ppl like to see the word freemium.not worth time & money at all....oh and the game has no story>they know tht so...",9.1

"do not let my hours playing this game fool you , ive played it for more than a thousand hour directly w/o steam and played it since release. the ultimate grinding experience , your only progression in this game is to obtain weapons/frames/rarecores. is it a bad grindfest ? no. enemies can be majorly challenging , maps have rotation starting spawns , you will almost never start at the same spot in the same map , but maps have a lot of sections and the devs even make the maps bigger and bigger with every patch. would you recommend ? -do you like running around being a badass space ninja ? -do you like to swing swords while being a badass space ninja? -do you like using super space ninja chi to kill your enemies? -are you willing to spend hours and hours grinding the same map for rngesus to bless you with a drop for a weapon youre making ? if the answer is yes to any of the questions , then its the game for you. the dev team is downright amazing , they actually listen to players , they host events , they do rebalances when needed and such , the game gets atleast 1 frame(armor/class) and 2 weapons per month so its lively and going strong and hold it goes strong while it lasts.",523.2

"tl;dr an amazing f2p you should give a try, but a little grindy this game is definitely worth a look. one of the best free2plays i have every played, if not the best. the game is super addicting and youll find that youll be logging an insane amount of hours in this game. one great thing about warframe is the constant updates/patches that all add amazing new things to the game or fix some of the present bugs. there are also tons of different warframes/weapons/companions that you can choose from to help suit your play style. my one problem with this game is it is super grindy. if you want to get all the parts for a new warframe/weapon or get a specific mod/resource (im looking at you oxium), youll probably have do the same mission or types of missions over and over just to have a chance of getting it. nevertheless, this game is amazing and definitely worth at least a try.",255.9

"what has made me super happy: - the game. its a lot of fun. - graphics are awesome, gameplay is smooth, and ninja robots. - good variety of levels and missions. - the game is really, really cool. what has upsetted me so far: - to register for my account i had to log in to the website via vpn probably because im in china and couldnt load the webpage otherwise. - some of the levels are pretty hard without help (solo). - more connection problems: friends often appear as offline, i also cant connect to others nor can others join my games. because most of the challenges are oriented towards multiplayer play, this renders half of the game inaccessible to me. im almost ready to give up and un-recommend this game again. summary: - really good game. if theyd spend more time working on fixing connectivity issues (dota 2, dont starve together all work just fine!) i would give this game a resounding thumbs up, but as of right now, im having trouble learning the game and not knowing if im doing things wrong game-wise or outside-game-wise is bothersome.",284.2

( directly to the left of the minimization button.) click on it, and a window with a set of check boxes should pop up. uncheck directx10 and directx 11. click ok or save and click the play button again. the game should launch normally. hope this helps!",130.0
"dis game. started days after it went into open beta, was stable as if it were a final version commercial release. absolutely wonderful to play with friends, although the objective fun in it is in setting your sights on a new warframe and working towards it. with 13 frames, theres a lot of work ahead for you to keep you busy, and it doesnt require too much money to get you those 11 extra slots!",458.0

"first and foremost: free. that virtue alone gives this game a huge plus to being recommended. you have nothing to lose by trying it. graphically this is one of the best free games ive played. its right up there with many top notch (as of 2013) pay to play games. the distant future ninjas in space premise isnt delved into very deeply lore wise. true lore and story gamers wont find much depth here to stimulate the imagination. players who prefer solo play will have fun for a while, but it will get repetitive. the game really shines in its multiplayer. group up with some pals (up to 4 of you) and ninja your way through a level as fast as possible annihilating the ai, picking up drops as fast as possible - its a feast of visual, reflex, and team work video game fun. it really serves strongly those gamer who love to min/max and find the ultimate way to manipulate the mechanics to make your team of pals godlike in its slaying, looting, collecting, building items glory. - solo/lore players i give this game 12-24 hours of game play enjoyment before boredom. - multiplayer co-op power gamers up to 100s of hours.",84.0

( bought and played since 2009. 4400 hours of pure fun ) warframe is extremely grinding game (be warned) yet it feels like it has the absolute best progression system ever, its highly polished and addictive even the first 30 mins of the tutorials. its not open world game yet it feels like you have freedom ! i dont know how the game designers achieved that ! 8/10",215.8

"with the fate of your race in the balance, it is up to you and the few remaining tenno to push the enemy out of the solar system. 8/10 a lot of fun with friends, gets difficult if you try to take on higher levels alone. the use of schematics to acquire weapons and warframes makes the feeling of getting new equipment all the more satisfying. although, if you are not a patient person the ability to purchase the equipment directly through the use of platinum (which is purchased with real money) can help you get the quick advantage over the enemy.",82.6

"warframe, for being in beta currently, is singlehandedly the most phenomenal f2p game i have had the pleasure to play. although, it is a f2p game thus having microtransactions. luckily, digital extremes (the game developers), took into consideration, hey, everyone hates pay 2 win games, right? ok, so well leave in microtransactions for the lazy people who play the game to complete it and not for fun, but well make a way to earn platinum without buying it!. if you have parts for a prime weapon or warframe (your suits) or even a decently rare mod, you can head over to trading chat and sell it for xx amount of platinum. not only are the creators not money hungry scumbags, warframe is highly addicting, as you can see from my playtime. you will eventually get yourself into a situation such as ugh, my stuff is so terrible, but i need to grind out some resources to get this new weapon or ugh my stuff is so good it just wrecks anything in my path. i want a challenge and youll attempt to quit the game. you will never quit warframe. even if some serious  goes down, de will somehow rope you back in. warframe, recommended 8.5/10 near endless hours of entertainment, and a hell of a f2p. for your sake, get this game.",1240.4

"ok, ftp this is a damn good game. pros: fast action, combat is a blast flashy graphics is a good term for them especially liked the melee its a better first/third hybrid than firefall (where you also use warframes) cons: shallow--read, not an rpg, youre a combat drone flashy graphics are kind of stupid, characters are cool, enemies look clunky if you slip up early, you cant change things much without paying--wouldnt call it pay to win, but pay to change t what you really want. i really wish they had made it umm...something relevant like...cyberpunk maybe or...a zombie slayer or....something that makes some kind of sense rather than this weird tenno alien thing. but for fun, playable, combat video game...its pretty tight.",1.7

"if you love grinding in rpgs, if you love mass effect, if you love ninjas and weapons, weapons everywhere then you will love this game. its a f2p game, you can access anything in the game without paying if you commit! make sure you use the alerts app or follow the alerts on twitter. the only reason you would need to pay is to expand your storage (more frames/wepons capacity and also event weapons give you storage spaces) and colors/skins (some helmets are even obtainable for free). in other words, i love this game. its fun, its repetitive but theres always new content coming out and the repetitive is just leveling up new weapons and new characters every day for fun.",893.7
"fast paced, just what you might ask for in a 3rd person shooter, i enjoy it as i play it on ps4 and pc",43.2
"pretty fun game, especially if you are into sci-fi stuff. it becomes even better if you are playing with frinds as squad. the main defect is that it can be boring if you want to craft weapon/frame and you need to get materials- it takes long time and you have to play on same maps again and again.",34.5
"advantages: space ninjas regular heavy content updates events almost constantly weapons for days lots of game modes good community good customization options looks great no hackers disadvantages: steep (but short) learning curve for new players. heavy grinding for endgame-tier gear frequent updates cuase bugs overall its a great game if you have a fair amount of time to kill grinding for stuff.",16.7

"good game but sadly id like to try the extrem multiplayer pvp.",7.3
"this game is very repetitive. it has a destiny feel to it, but with more focus on melee combat. it lags a lot when teaming up with a group, but that might just be my system. the game is trying to push the idea of p2w when every menu having items to buy right at the beginning, and anything you can buy with in game cash is overly expensive and not worth the time and effor, especially since each mission has such a little pay off. components for the blueprints are just impossible to find. each mission is the same, even story missions. go from point a to point b and kill wave after wave of enemies. the regular missions are just wave defense games. all in all the game is just a big waste of time with no pay off, its boring even though it had such a good premise. space ninjas. how could you have gone so terribly wrong?",6.9
"where to start? oh over 820 hours spent in this game. this game... why would you not want to slice up enemies in numerous ways? this game does have a lot of repitition in grinding for the parts for various things, but when you finally build that thing you worked a week of your life for, you have a great sense of self satisfaction and a week of your life gone. all in all. get this if you are into fast paced parkour, killing, ninjas, or any type of 4 player co-op game. there are several different levels to play in this game. try it out and you too may some day have 800+ hours into this game. :d",907.9

"honestly after playing this game for more than a few months, this is the best free to play game on steam. beats tf2 by a long shot. warframe is a game about space ninjas with no real questline to follow. you basically do what you want, when you want, where you want, with what you want. form a crew if you feel like it. want to have a giant hammer that crushes everything beneath your feet? go ahead! or do you want the more stealthy approach? take a bow and small sword. you play as a tenno: a superpowered race of humans with engineered suits that give them unique and amazing abilities. the community is extremely nice, and the developers have set a very good free to play model for their game. they are a company that cares. they put out events and update their game regularly, and nothing in this game is pay to win. everything can be obtained legit, minus extra modifications and skins. the grind can be long, but when you finally finish that gun or armor you want, it is the most rewarding feeling ever. 10/10 play this game.",225.7

"a fast-paced third person shooter. game best played with friends and using team speak to communicate. playing with random people can by okay, but usually you play with guys that are just farming resources, so its rush to the end. i burned me drive for this game when it was still in beta. the game just comes down to geting resources to build new wepons and warframes, if collecting stuff is your cup of tea, go for it, if your not up to grinding for hours then it is a skip.",166.7
"havent played it enough to write an in-detail review, but get this game. its awesome.",5.4
"gravedigger fagus said it best: its a game about space ninjas destroying space nazis and futuristic ea representatives. i dont think i need to say any more here. you cant leave out the mutant zombie versions of said nazis and ea reps. its like this, you and your crew infiltrate ships and bases on various planets and   up (and thats just with the weapons)! when everything is done, your team rolls out like nothing happened. space nazis, what space nazis? exactly. seriously though, the game is extremely fun. you get your choice of primary, secondary and melee weapons, per loadout, from an assortment of weapons from each faction (with an option to go melee only). there are several warframes to choose from, each with unique abilities. you can customize the colors for pretty much everything! you aquire mods to make your weapons and warframes more powerful. you can have up to 3 different mod loadouts and color schemes for everything. practically every weapon and warframe can be attained through crafting. the game is updated fairly frequently, and most importantly, its free! so if youre like me and enjoy shooters, co-op, hack and slash, love ninjas and are flat broke, this is the game for you!",987.3

"best free to play game in awhile. most free to pay are freemium; wear cash can make overly powered. but this not the case with warframe. there is in store cash only items ,but most weapons and warframes can be got with simply time and effort. combine with combat composed both mele and ranged it makes for a fairly enetetaining mmo",314.3

"this is an incredible game. warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal.ultimately, if youre just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than warframe",413.3
"good game, but too many bugs including random disconnecting from server and more.",78.8

"a very nice idea! a not so new approach to the genre but very well executed. the characters are nice, textures are crisp, and the game is well optimized even on older computers all you need to do is lower the resolution really it has to work! as an added + whoever liked the multiplayer in mass effect 3 will definitely enjoy this i dont know why; after a while it can get boring but that really depends on the person; yes indeed the levels are a little repetitive and lookalike but still...its a nice experiment run by a strong developlemnt team who promise nothing but quality even for the future... at least give it a try there enough for everybody!",6.1

"i enjoyed playing, but they use every trick in the book to get your money, making the game almost unplayable for free. all in all it is a fun game but they got too greedy and now i dont play it any more. i imagine it would be less expensive as a monthly subscription game than on its current model. oh and also the multiplayer is a bit glitchy/frustrating. if your friend drops out of your game, they may as well quit because they have lost every reward up to that point & all of the enemies have been revived & are coming to eat their faces. out of interest these are some of their methods to grab money: - limited lives per day, and choke points late in levels so you are forced to revive (revives cost money) - the drop rate of good items (weapons etc) is rare to encourage you to buy them with money - in-game money will usually only buy you a blueprint of something, which you must then craft, costing extra in-game dosh and items - crafting (which you have to do to get your new weapons & suits) takes hours/days of real time but if you use money you can bypass the wait - pets need daily medicine that is expensive with in-game cash, but also available for money - some rare items are only available as rare rewards from places you can only go if you get a rare drop, and have a limited life span (eg 24 hours) before they are destroyed from your inventory",18.9

"6/10 certainly not the best game i have ever played. i played for a few hours and got bored. the missions tend to repeat themselves. it is a pay to win game. and the combat is somewhat confusing. i run in to battle with my rifle and i cant see anything beacause there are just fire and lightning bolts flying accross my screen. i cant level up beacause everyone killsteals. and if i play alone i am underlevel. so im forced to play for hours on the same mission just so i can level up a bit. there are a few mechanics and features in this game that i do find entertaining and fun. i love sci-fi games. but i just found this game a little off. im shure this comment will be outdated by the time anyone reads this. chances are they fixed the things im complaining about. this game has a bit of a learning curve and it doesent explain the lore very well. the game itself is quite the vicious cycle, and to get out of the cycle you need to pay money. real money. i know many games have shops (tf2) where you can buy cosmetics and weapons, but this game causes players just to become pay to wins. giving this game a try was a bit of a waste of time for me to be honest. apologies if i cause controversy.",36.7

"im about 10 hours in by this review and i can say so far that- especially for a free-to-play- warframes a blast. the controls are smooth and have a great learning curve while combats generally fun and varied. unlike other free-to-plays (im looking at you, blacklight: retribution!!!), taking the high road of not using real-world currency to purchase items doesnt leave you in the dust; it takes longer to purchase weapons, but not outlandishly-so. instead theres a rewarding feeling when you finally grab that beauty of a bow after so many playthroughs. the only thing so far that bugs me is the repetition, which the games got too much of. by the time its reached a final product new missions should likely become a big part of it to add a little variety to the grind, but so far im pretty happy with how developments coming for it.",128.7

"ok, so i came home from school one day and as soon as i join the call (after doing my homework obviously) yo, you gotta get this game uhm, what game is it? its called warframe, you gotta try this so after half an hour, this new game was downloaded and i went around playing it. i fell in love with it. literally. the amazing gameplay, parkour, grinding, differant weapons and classes made me fall for this game as i did with games like diablo. pretty soon i had my first warframe other than the mag that i started off with. my friends all calling me a tryhard for getting my valkyr. i passed my level 3 mastery rank before my friends even reached level 2, and suddenly i found myself one-shotting everything in the low level missions that my friends thought were difficult. pretty soon they stopped playing warframe, saying that it was crap and boring. but i kept on going, i got into trading and got myself a frost prime and burston prime. this is a pretty good game i thought to myself, meanwhile all my friends still saying it was bad. i still havent stopped playing, and i am on my way (3/4 of the way) to getting mastery rank 7, and i am still feeling pumped every time i start a mission. overall my verdict is... dont play if you a) have a girlfriend b) plan on having a life c) like vor if your none of the above, then i would definitely recommend this game to anybody, especially those who loved diablo or destiny",454.4

"the game is broken for me. developers couldnt add a simple fps cap in the game so its completely unplayable. since my only experience is from 2013, ill be basing my review off that. its another cheap f2p game. the game gets monotonous very quickly since there are few mission/enemy variety. whenever you want to create a gun or something, it makes you wait a few hours or a day or two. i cant remember. you can bypass this by of course spending real money. skip on this one. also suck it fanboys.",88.4

"all i can say about this one is that i am shocked that a game like this one is free to play actually; i can really see myself spending money on this game! however, like any free to play game, it is packed full of micro transactions, making it so you can buy the things you want. however, this game seems more generous in that aspect, you can either buy it with real money, or you can keep playing and earn credits in the game to aquire the same things that people would buy with their own cash. the graphics in this game are top notch as well as the overall gameplay. the game has been built so you can experience this game alone or with your friends and random people online who would wish to accompany you on your quests. this game is very much worth looking into if you are in anyway intrested in a futuristic cenario which takes place in space. the game on top of looking good also seems like it is willing to offer a lot of gameplay, both through many planets and objectives through the solar system as well as replayability to either find resources to rebuild your character or just replaying a map as a newly built character. it seems you can build your character to either be a spectre in the shadows, taking enemies out without anyone knowing you were even in the area; or a blood lusting banshee, screaming through and leaving death in your wake. however, if this was too long; one word to sum this game up really, space ninjas. go play it.",858.0

"quite the grindfest, but still enjoyable nonetheless. has a lot of different abilities and items to collect and level, making customization another strong part of the game. the game can be played without spending any money. however, the largest roadblock is the limited number of slots for storing weapons and warfarmes (classes). one needs to spend real money to unlock these slots. however, the slots are reasonably priced, and i am happy to support the developer. the game is continually changing and having new content added. it is still in beta, so we dont know if the developer will put forth the same effort once the game is released. overall, ive had a lot of fun with warframe, even though it does get repetitive.",79.6
"theres literally only one problem of the game and its based individually on each person. how far are you willing to go? after completing weapon mastery of over 60+ weapons, i can say that it is in fact based on what youre willing to do. the game-play does get repetitive after reaching your first mastery; however, people usually subside this repetitiveness by playing a different style, warframe, or using a different weapon. dueling is another way, but in the end, i dont expect this game to go competitive where cash prizes may be concerned.",655.4
"this is a fun and fast paced sci-fi shooter with excellent gameplay. with a variety of weapons, classes and a unique level/ ranking system, its a good free-to-play time sink. micro-transactions can get a bit pricey, but taking advantage of sales as well as in game coupon rewards shouldnt make it a problem. everything that isnt cosmetic or an inventory slot can be obtained without dropping a penny but luck and being online at the right times plays a big part in getting some of the rarer items. overall a swell f2p shooter with good mechanics that is definitely worth anyones time. also space ninjas!",953.0

"warframe is a great f2p 3rd person shooter, after the tutorial you get a choice out of 3 warframes. loki which has great support and is the fastest warframe, excalibur which has powerful offense skills, and mag which has amazing magnetics powers. all of which can be unlocked over time for free by killing the specific boss that drops their parts. it has a very indepth customization and sort of a rock paper scissors with the new damage formula. grinner are weak to puncture, corpus are weak to impact, infested are weak to slashing. to make this game really great you need to have friends to play with, pugs are doable but if you have 3 friends in differnt warframes with differnt equipment sets you feel really badass as you rip through enemy forces effortlessly. this kind of game you ether love or you hate, and since it is f2p why not give it a couple of hours to decide its well worth it.",706.1
"i didnt play it that long, just a couple hours. but imo thats plenty long enough to know what a game is like. i didnt really like it. the shooting is ok. the graphics are good. but the free-to-play nonsense is all over this game. i mean, why not sell boxed copies (or digital downloads, since were on steam) to fund your development of it? and no, i dont mean credit packs. id really like a good spacey-shooter mmorpg, but this thing needs more variety in level design, and get rid of the lame paywalls. make it fun first! ultimately, i just uninstalled it because i couldnt see myself enjoying this kind of thing for very long. everything is a repetitive grind.",2.5

"a wonderful game in both design and gameplay. playing by your self can be infruriating due to the fact that lives must be purchased with platinum (buyable currency, but slight amounts can be earned through gameplay). if you have no lives and you die on a mission, you fail the mission, end of. this is why i recommend always playing with friends, as not only can they revive you free of charge (unless the friends you have are cruel sadists) but playing with friends is much easier and more fun. overall, a great 3rd person mmo, if a little stingy with unlocks and in game marketing. 8/10",12.7

"i love this game if you enjoy grinding and getting to feel like you got an awsome reward for that farming then this is your game if you keep up a fast pace and go like the ninja way you can kill every one. the mod are plenty i have been playing for almost 500 hours and you start to see that they put in some filler. if you put the game on ultra for the graphics it looks like your playing a future type tv movie. the lore is lacking but they have said that they may put in some more into it.when they make an update like for version 14,15 exc it always has somthing amazing to offer. the old tutorial is crap compared to the exclent one now for example you can get to chose your own guns and weapons insead of having the crap mk-1 braton,skana, but the lato was good. the mission and events make it so that you cant get bored and when you play void survival it feel like a battle to the death and your fighting and endless wave of enimes. the defense is a bit less then the survival but you have a less priority of caring for your life. the weapon selection is huge i want to try and make all the guns but i have only schratched the surface. the warframe make it so you can adapte to any situation. i recomend if you do get platinum you should save it either to get parts resouces or getting some stuff from the trade tab.i recomend fully that you get this game and even though your bored from farming just for a bit the reward after is the best thing you can get",776.5

"i have mixed feelings about this game. its definitely a pay-to-win game. although the action and design can be fun, all too often you come across punishing (not challenging) points of the game can be easily overcome by throwing money at it or will make you walk away annoyed. for some of us, that isnt a problem. for others, we prefer to earn our rewards and the cost financial cost of purchasing the win is often more than one can afford. the faq says, nearly all content in warframe can be earned over time for free. you can collect credits anywhere, but the only currency that actually matters is platinum and platinum is only purchasable. multiple in-game currencies is a terrible concept. you can make it available for purchase, but being unable to earn platinum leaves out a good portion of your players. the community is absolutely full of judgemental s. be prepared. in short, if youre 12 (or have the maturity level of a 12 year old), like gobs of violence in lieu of any form of story, and dont mind buying solutions to all your problems, this is the game for you.",145.4

"i only tried warframe because i noticed the art direction was exactly the same as another game, dark sector. go look it up, because its pretty neat. anyway, it turns out warframe was the original idea that digital extremes wanted to make. this is grand because warframe is rather good. back when i first started playing warframe, it was nothing like it is now. everything has been polished and lots of content has been added. its your run of the mill co-op game with grinding all over the place. thankfully, its possible to get everything without paying a cent. nothing outside of some cosmetics is locked from the player. all of the loot drops for schematics and parts are based on chance, but they only drop at certain locations. if you know where, you can find it. if you have some friends to play with, its even easier to get the items. theres no publisher, such as ea, lurking over digital extremes and demanding things; so, theres more emphasis on pleasing the players into forking over money than resorting to  tactics to leech money, see ea (again). chances are, youll play this for a good 10 hours, then fork over $20 to just get a slight boost and to support de. warframe is a prime example of how to do free-to-play. worth your time.",404.3
"in my mind, this is the best thing you can currently do for free with your gaming time, and shooter fans will love this game. it has its challenges, and its problems, mainly in the way of making new content feel new, but its a great game. so jump yourself out of your proverbial air duct, and give the game a try, you may be surprised with how much time you can lose in a game as great as this one!",1059.8

"the only downside to this game is that there is no open world or even sandbox type environment to expand immersion within the world. in virtually every other aspect, the game is a dream-like playground for fans of games like mass effect, unreal tournament, or in some ways even prince of persia and ninja gaiden. there is wall running handled in a well executed manner, there is melee combat complete with actual combos and timing as well as blocking, there is evil space creatures and factions to kill and hate, and there is a huge array of both weapons and warframes to choose from and collect in order to diversify your experience. even recently a new system of flight combat was added straight out of a space shooter sim hybrid. while it is true the game is very light on story line or explanation, and can become quite grindy after a deep binge of obsessive exposure, the core systems of the game are bieng constantly improved and there is no pay 2 win mechanic because anything you can acquire through the shop except for a very few cosmetics are all obtainable in game. pvp players be warned however, this game is not about pvp, at all, and the pvp aspect of the game is not very well realized or implemented at this point. while pvp is playable, it is certainly not for everyone and is not what the game is focused around at all.",818.9

"i would highly recommend this game because it is alot of fun and is a great game.there is alot of epic weapons and different playing styles. there is the ability to buy (through the currency earned in the game) blueprints for new weapons and make them yourself. to do this you need to earn the resources through game play and by visiting different planets. you can play the game in solo mode which allows for a more leisurely game or you can play by inviting other players (through private mode) or play online with other players joining when they want to. i personally like to play online because this enables you to collaborate with other online players on missions. you can also set up a clan or you can ask to join an already established clan. clans give you more support and great team work. you can buy (with game currency) special blueprints (not available through the store) from the clan research facilities through the clan dojo.",1013.7

"this game is awesome. you got a character (you can select 3 different in the start) and the character is called a tenno. you are a kind of an elite group and will get some missions. the grafic in the game is also pretty good and sound is awesome. it takes some time to learn all the controls and how to use them in fight. but its easy to shoot and it works good whit guns,rifles,and other. theres also some totaly sci-fi weapons and you can use mods on your tenno and weapons. a other weapon is sword. tennos is like a ninja and can make stealth kills. if you just take rifle and starts shotting a bunch of enemys they will alarm. and so there will come alot of enemys after you. but if the alarm starts you can hack the system and it will reset to normal security. thats a bit about the game. i think that this should cost money its so good. the only bad thing is that its a bit hard to get weapons. but the start weapons a fine so you can use them whitout getting to much troubble in mission. and in the missions you can make a squad whit 2-4 random players or some from your clan. and 75% will make teamwork and 25% will just drive solo. so i give 9/10 stars. this game is awesome download it",19.0

"one of the best co-op games made... graphics gorgeous, gameplay smooth... the only thing i think it lacks is the true power, of ultimate space-ninja-hybrid-alien-thingies-powers. sadly i dont feel like a galaxy god :d i recomend this game anywhere, anytime, solo, random player co-op or the best... with your friends. ;)",36.5
"game trolls you with throwing you back to login screen. not worth playing cause takes your mood away from the actual game to wait 5-20 minutes just to relogin, only to be thrown out again.. disgusting. 10/1 should not run servers on wooden pc.",57.7
"more of a warfarm than a warframe. i have become quite addicted to this free to play game. most things are available in the game with out having to pay cash for it. just requires a bit of farming to get. only things that arent, are warframe slots, weapon slots, and vanity stuff like scarfs and colours. third person 4 player co-op shooter/hack and slash. but of course if you are too lazy to farm stuff up... you can always pay money for new frames and weapons too.",220.0

"this game is consists of mostly grinding resources, blueprints and mods to create your ulitimate arsenal. nevertheless, this is still such a good game. interesting weapons and warframes, maps and events. the game, at first, is a grind to get to your desired arsenal. but when you get there, boy is it fun to play. i do recommend getting some friends to play with you for double the fun.",300.6

"i played this game over 24 hours, so i might know what im talking about. warframe is a great looking game in many ways and yet feels good too. this game seems to be a too good free-to-play, but yet i feel like i paid for it. story is good but not bad, but what we all gamers care about the fun and gameplay in games, and this game does a great job of doing this. i highly people who really spend their time playing video games to play this game... but yet im not a player who playes all day and i still enjoy playing it. if i were to give it a score of 1 though 10 it would be a 9-out of 10, because it still has more updaes to come and yet when a new warframe comes out every update it get sadden and feel that im not powerful anymore. some bugs here and there but you will not run into any on your great adventure in this game. this game is a should have.",153.0
"this game is very in-depth, it starts off really slow and boring. but if you have a friend that has played alot and can help you, then it is a much more enjoyable game.",418.0

"i cant play war-frame because the game wont let me update",24.8
"man i love ninjas, space ninjas, thats just awsome. the game may not be the moast intense game you have ever played, its more about the community and the friends that you play this game with. this is a good time with friends, the crafting takes a long time and it may get updated with wierd changes from time to time, but if you boil it down its still the same game that i started playing with my friends, and i still enjoy those times.",567.5

"such a good game its free to play so keep in mind that it has flaws, it has very good grafics for it being a free to play,nice lore,characters, lots of weapons and a bunch of ther  :p but if you dont like to grind then this game is not for you the game is hard at first because you have a hard time finding people to do the first missions so keep that in mind but once you get the game and how it is you will find everything very easy",96.5

"been addicted to this since day one playing this game.has nice graphic, soundtrack, leveling system is great and also who doesnt love space ninja. grinding for this game is fun. sometime grinding can feel somewhat repetitive but it doesnt have that feeling for this game. i really recommend this game.",106.5
"this game combines amazing graphics and fun, fast gameplay into a amazing package. the division between different warframes and modifications available make this game unique. the best part is that there is no pay to play. yes to get things it gets alittle grindy but its worth it. well made game with more coming up for it hopefully",53.1
"its a free to play and its my fav free to play on the market!",8.0
"warframe has changed so much since the release on steam. when it was first released to the public, it was fun being a space ninja, but the missions and battles were pretty repetitive. over time, warframe has went through sooooo many changes. some good. some bad. but heres the thing, the developers actually communicate with the players and ask what they want in the game. i have so much respect for them. everyone should atleast give this game a try. i mean, it is free.",161.1
"i have warframe on my xbox one as well. i really enjoy it and love the computer version as well1",0.1
"the story is terrible, the graphics are good but not anything special, the gameplay is repetetive and requires a lot of grinding to get anywhere. however for some reason its my favourite game and i find it completely addictive, it might be the space ninja robots, it might the super fun movement system or vast array of weapons and characters, im not sure but i love it. 9/10!",583.3
"it is fun but very challenging then i thought it would be",3.2
"+character designs is pretty cool +really good gameplay +co-op +lens flare is awesome +graphic is pretty good +same mission -->random map/ spawn place +its free ! -you might want to play this with friends -i just dont like some of its bgm -melee system is good but it can be better -fighting some bosses doesnt feel like boss fight at all overall, this is one of the best f2p game. if you like to wall run, do double backflip, and stab guys in the chest this is definitely your game.",301.9
"its like a stealth-game + action packed videogame for free, with a lot of potatoes!!!",26.5
"this game is awesome and truly free to play. the only thing you pay for is cosmetic items and thats about it. developers continually listen to the community and add content on a frequent basis. totally worth the hours you are able to put into it!",761.5
"warframes a pretty good game to play with a bunch of friends. cooperative play is a must, yet solo is satisfying as well when you play solo missions. i would recommend this game to those of you looking for a game to play with others at a lan party!",691.1

"space ninjas in space with space guns. thats basically what i say the game is to people that have no clue about it. and i love this game. sure it has its fault, suich as f2p meaning nothing, you still need to spend at least $20 on it eventually. but other than that, the devs are nice, the community is good. and its all in a ll fun to play. the gamer itself is really neat, even though its a beta, its still a very decent game. a lot of fun killing times, granted its not very heavy on the lore, but its still a good game. its sort of like minecraft, you dont understand it, but you still get addicted to it at some point or another. the weapons are cool, and the fact that you put on a different suit and it gives you these awesome abilities, makes it fun. you can customize the play style to however you want it to be. stealthy, bum rush, magic. its all there. so check it out. it wont cost you anything to start, but if you get into it, a little investment to help out these awesome devs is totally worth it.",413.6
"this game was fun. i enjoyed it for a prolonged period of time after being diagnosed with late-life, high-functioning autism disorder. then it turned out to be completely awful because de is a bunch of money-loving potatoes. imagine if your favorite black ops character was replaced with a man in a monkey suit that made various shouts when he entered combat. im not giving you anymore j-tokens, you cheeky breeky fast-flyers.",187.8

"warframe is a great game, but alot of people abandon it due to it being a grind-fest overall its really good rating: 9/10 pros: completly free(unless your lazy) good visuals easy controls loads of differant classes,playstyles and weapons cons: (might just be me) game was really hard to get into at the begining grinding(think monster hunter)",281.2

"game is fun! love it, a must play free to play game. cant really put my finger on it but well its a well worth game! try it out! you wont regret it.",6.0
"i definately recommend this game to everyone, its absoluetly amazing! i just cant get enough of this game, ive only been playing it for about 6 days now and i have lots of time put into this game. for just a free to play game, this one is a lot of fun, and it has amazing graphics plus it runs really smooth. some people say that you have to buy platinum if you want decent stuff. but actually, the only time you have to use platinum, is when you want cosmetics (i.e. helmet, syandana, better colours, etc...), more warframe/weapon slots, or to purchase something right away. now, i would recommend using the 50 platinum they give you to start off with, to buy more slots, because the cosmetic stuff isnt really that important, where as slots are. basically everything else, you can get blueprints for, then go around to the different planets and missions to gather the materials to build them. some blueprints (warframes for example) require that you fight bosses more than once or go into the void so you can get things such as, the helmet, chassis, and systems. yes, this can take some time, but its worth it in the end. overall, i think this is a great game! the only negatives i could think of, is how some maps are used more than once, even though youre on a totally different planet, and the fact that you have to buy more colours with platinum. but, other than that, this game is great, and if you havent already, try it out! its free :d",64.5
"awesome game, good graphics only downside would be since its peer to peer if your host has bad internet lets just say the amount of lag is insane. but overall an amazing and addicting game.",397.3
"great fun for a free game. is a grinding game and is not ashamed of that. digital extremes updates the game frequently and are very interactive with the community. end game is lacking apart from solar rails (not for solo players), once you have every frame and gun maxed there is not much else to do.",621.8
"lets just say, your going to be doing one certain mission a lot. in warframe, you have to buy blueprints to get new weapons and stuff. after you buy blueprints you have to get certain materials. after you get said materials, you can craft it, and its going to take about a day for the item to actually craft. wait simulator 2099 10/10 would allahu ackbar again",43.5
"its a ok game. but not for me. i dont like the story....",2.3
"warframe is a very fun game that gets updated regularly and is also very fun to play with friends because it has a stragey/stealth aspect that can be used. my only complaint about the game is the farming for crafting. its very tedious and includes you getting the blueprint for the item, getting the crafting components for the blueprint (usually involving farming), then waiting for the item to finish after you use credits and the components. other than that warframe is very unique to any other game in the genre and definitly deserves some attention for how cool it is.",291.4
"ive played tons of f2p games over the years and while warframe isnt my normal mmo (i usually play rpg games) i have to say its definitely a game that constantly surprises and impresses me. ill admit i dont play it very often and ill get bored and quit for a bit, but each time i come back there is always something new and friggin awesome! digital extremes....you guys are top notch, keep it going :)",531.4
"really good free to play game! warframe is amazing for a free to play, its massive with so many wepons and unique mods the posibilities are endless! i also love that its not a pay to win type game which is great if you dont want to spend any money. give it a try!",83.6
"the game was fun at first, but after playing for hours, ive noticed that the enemies feel very repetitive. the enemies are doing the same thing, saying the same thing, and dying the same way. also, there are very limited characters and weapons. you can only level be leveling the equipment. and i got stuck on a level because when i couldnt afford to buy anything more, and maxed the levels in everything.",38.0
"the scenario is not really good, but it is like call of duty, we play it for the gameplay and do not care about the story behind it. the gameplay is awesome, and the tps view reminds how good this game is. even if the weapon and ability systems are (really) hard to understand, the gameplay is just, yeah awesome. the only minor complain about this game is that for small rigs it can sometimes freeze and/or lag.",7.1
"if you like grinding, ninjas, bows, kunais, and swords then play this game pls",142.0
"this is a very, very good game; for a free-to-play third person shooter, it blows away any and all competition, and you dont have to pay a cent to get powerful. its smooth, sleek, looks great on pc. its intense, action packed; you will hardly have a dull moment. and its only in beta. i want to see how this game plays out as a full-fledged platform for free action; it has my attention in all earnesty.",431.7
"great 3rd person f2p shoot the best fun i have had in awhile :d",29.0
"warframe is a great game to play with friends, since it is very much a co-op game and teamwork is essential for success. on top of everyting, its free! also, this is not a pay to win game, since all in-game items can be crafted or won in in-game events without spenidng a dime. the graphics are great, and sometimes i just play because of them! though there is no actual story, there are planets, items, guns, clans, and anything needed to make this a great sci-fi game thatll give you hourse of fun! just beware, if your computer is very slow, lag may affect gameplay.",151.1

"good development and updates still going on. the graphic is good. nice game",160.9
"i honestly dont know how to rate this game. you grind to grind and the grinding isnt even the kind where an erection is expected. drop rates suck, players suck and trading in this game? id rather inject meth directly into my testicles and skewer my eyes on rusty thumbtacks. that being said; if you enjoy this game and how free! it is youll want to spend money on it, youll feel an actual need to, just to avoid spending 5 hours mindlessly copypasting a list of 20 or so mods you want to sell for half the price of what people usually ask. but you can go fast, there are lots of colours and latex body suits with some nice butts in them. i give it a 9/11",593.6

"been playing it since cbt and before it got onto steam. great fun at first but will get grindy near end game. the dev are working on improving the end game contents and adding new stuffs with every update so its worth a shot and they take players feedbacks seriously. gameplay: 7/10 graphics: 9/10 sound: 5/10 replayability: 8/10 community: 5/10 dev support: 10/10",92.9

"for a free game this is pretty good, the combat is good, the weapons are pretty balanced and the levels are well made and numerous so you always seem to have new experience. the graphics are really good for a free game, usually you would definitely not see this level of graphical quality in a game. the leveling up is screwed up for beginners and higher levels wreck the balance for new players and the 4 person co-op is kind of limiting at times but thats all i can really say against it. they should add more game modes with different numbers of players such as deathmatches and the like for multiplayer. overall not a bad game though, 8/10.",6.6

"best game ive ever played and best of all its freeeeeee ;)",14.2
"a great game which involves not only shooting skills, but strategy as well. the bad part about this game is the fact that you cant really communicate with your team in the game, which makes it a bit difficult to coordinate some times. the best way to play this game and enjoy it to its fullest is to form your own team and communicate through stream, skyper or other similar programs. that dosent mean that playing the solo is not fun, it is, but everything is more enjoyable when you are surrounded by friend. so go on! form your team and go kick some alien butt!",4.8
"i was enjoying the game, it is hard to really aquire anything outside of your starters without either grinding for gear and parts for hours, and or just spending money. i had put enough time to pretty much max my orignal tenno, when i got banned. for no reason, all was said was i some how violated the eula, when i have done nothing wrong in my knowledge, i contacted support and said after manual review i did indeed do something to do such, was not told what still, and said ban could not be lifted. glad i never wasted my money on this at this point. i will not recommend anygame that bans players without a reasonable explination and violating the eula is not reasonable.",7.8

"warframe is basically an addictive mmoprg mass effect game, that should be all i have to say. but this game is addicting for all the right reasons, the loot. you just want to keep playing a little bit longer to see what will drop, usually it doesnt pay off but thats half the fun of it. it forces you to cooperate with others to play levels longers, to trade, and to go to the void as often as possible. i definitely recommend this game to anyone that loves the combat flow of the mass effect games coupled with cooperate yet at the same time competitive third person shooter game.",132.1

"do you like calises on your wrists? do you like carpal tunel syndrome? do you like your fingers twiching involuntarely, causing acidental key presses? if you answered no to any of these questions, this game is not for you. seriously addicting. the grind can be rough, or very rewarding. you can be the poor soul spending 100+ hours to farm for one missing component (like me) and have one of your friends get it in 30 minutes. the graphics are nice. eyecandy is always welcome. it is a little glitchy. ive joined games where im stuck out of the boundaries of a room, or ive slid one inch too far and been catapulted out of the map. sound is nice, though i mute the music. epic ninja drums can only be enjoyed for so long. my one complaint is how expencive the cash shop is. $20 for a single warframe? i can get 30 days of game time in most games for that kind of money, with all of the goodies included. also, you will need to either farm a lot to get some platinum, or sink real money in here, because you will want more frames than you have room for, and you only get room with cold hard cash, or platinum. overall, i quite enjoy this game.",604.0

"its freemium done right. everything but cosmetics are obtainable through playing the game. as a freemium game there are wait times for when you are building things. at some times the game can be slightly grindy, however usually its still quite fun. there are lots of clans in the game that you can join and chat with the people in them. beware of the trade market, the benefit of the clans can help prevent you from getting tricked into selling something way cheaper than what is could be worth. in the end have fun",722.1

"one the best 3rd person shooters ive played in along time. space ninjas with guns what more do you want. the game is still in beta yes but its extremely playable and enjoyable. for a f2p game you really dont need to induluge in mirco-transaction to compete which makes for a pleasent change. overall 8/10, the game has pleanty of potential left in it for that to change to a 9.",329.9
"pretty sweet game but i played this game for a week and got bored of it.",17.2
"its a fun game but it crashes way too much, it happens about every 30 minutes or so for me.",9.9
"even though most people already play the best free-to-play game on steam,(this game.) i thought i should write a review about how good this game is. the running up walls and jumping like a lunatic is one of the things that made this game a fun game to play, and the shooting is the second. mixing in some magic in this has made the game what it is. customization is also great, but there is not much to customize to me. it keeps you playing to try getting better and max out everything you have bought, keep since the beginning, or crafted together. always keeping you at your feet with trying to unlock certain items or blue-prints so you can make that weapon or warframe you always wanted.(or missions in your codex.) i recommend this game a 10/10 and one of the best games ive ever played. thanks for reading this review and hope you love the game.",35.6
"fast paced shooter, fun and pretty addictive. the graphics can be boosted to oustanding levels, and its one of the best free to play games so far. i would reccommend this game to anyone.",20.5
"very good graphics and quality. i really do recommend playing with a friend or other people, but its still fun playing solo. i recommend it to people who like third-person shooters and a very large and long campaign.",15.8
"grinding simultor 2014. a nice game all round with nice visual effects and customization options, but quite repetitive and boring towards mid/late game. pretty much grinding until you can find a new place to grind more often. purely grind to get items that enable you to grind more in the places that you unlocked by grinding. did i mention grinding? 2/10, would not install again.",105.5
"very good game. graphics are superb, gameplay is fastpaced and satisfying. the only down side is that there is little endgame other then: level up more weapons and warframes.",447.8
"good game... when you are okay with grinding. its like diablo 3, except it has guns and the loot doesnt drop nearly as much. repetitive, but looks great on the iest of computers. as of this review, there is an event called th cicero crisis. updates and events happen regularly, and the game has improved vastly since 6 months ago. however, the event is repetitive (you take scan plants to get components to make antidotes to open defense missions to get points to get loot). thats warframe in a nutshell. play with friends. if not, play co-op. dont ever do solo. different strokes for different folks.",397.7

"the free to play portion is an absolute bore and a chore. tad repetative all around though.",10.1
"if you havent at least tried out warframe, its about time to give it a try. its has a lot of very interesting aspects for a free to play. different play styles, configuations and customizations to play around with. add cool looking guns and melee weapons along side a parkour like battle system and you have a game that you will either love or hate.",271.8
"an extremely satisfying blend of rpg/mmo progression and satisfying 3rd person action based gameplay, warframe is definitely a game worth picking up for the low cost of free.",222.8

"haha! what a splendid game of dungeons and dr- wait. this isnt dnd? well it certainly is a brilliant game to say the least! played for a total of 300+ hours (not all at once, mind you) and i can say for certain that this game is a very in-depth one. the story may need a bit of work, the gameplay may tend to be a tiny bit repetitive, but overall this game is one that im sure youll enjoy! its absolutely packed with content and its array of features is slowly accumulating so expect to see something new everytime you come back from a break. download this game, if you already have then get back to work tenno! :d",476.6
"really enjoyable to play and im not sure why we have to get a key to be in our clan",3.2
"this game is very repetitive in its maps and gameplay. its good for a free game but not anything else.",2.1
"damn, this game is really not that great, its generic plus it doesnt require much skill, but hot damn im so addicted to it. pros : very fun and addicting cons : not enough hours in a day to play it, takes away your social life and prevents you from studying for exams. 11/10 would pay for it anytime.",483.9
"your a in space ninja with unique individual powers. oh and did i mention you can do parkour?! wall running, wall hanging, all kinds flips. and thats not all, the weapons you use are just as cool. you got big swords, little swords, katanas, two handed swords, daggers, daggers with swords, two daggers. the guns range from the classical shoot with bullets, or ones that have a rediculous amount of fire power, some shoot saws, others shoot sticky white things that explode (kinky developers? i think not!) and shotguns. as well as secondaries, but i cant name them all as to my hands for being tired of typing all of this. anywho, give this game a try, i fell in love with it the moment it was teasered i believe in january? yes its still in beta, but the full version will be free either way. this game is far from being completed, but even farther from being boring. exuce me, my tf2 has finally downloaded.",17.6
"im over system requirments. but out of others reviews, experiances, and a good friend of mine - he loves it. so just from per-pressure out of all good iv seen threw youtube, hosting sites, clan sites, this, and the original web site. ill have to recommend it. it looks good and the game play looks very unqiue. = lass my computer crashes to a blue screen then reboots when i tried this game... happen to me with metro: last light as well. no idea why.",0.4
"really good game, there are still some bugs. runs smooth, even on an older computer. optimized really great. sad there isnt any cross-platform.",3.5

"yes please... dont wonder if this game is any good... just play it.. a lot... 3rd person shooter action with wall climbing, super jumping, melee weapon action... its so good.. youll wonder why you dont even have to pay for it!!!!! awesome new quests to get you started and introduce you to the game make it even sweeter for new players, your upgradable space ship is an awesome between mission base and gives a nice home to the various non mission activities such as crafting, modifications and research. tldr: just do it!!!!!! nuff said",161.7
"ever want to run through alien ships leaping from wall to wall while shooting people in the face? welcome to warframe. the idea of being a space ninja taking down enemy factions in a dystopian future may seem silly at first but in practice its a crazy amount of fun. with a collector style upgrade system and plenty of weapons available warframe has a lot to offer.oh and did i mention its free?",217.3

"a game with space and ninjas. space ninjas. what more could you ask for? starting small and having next to no equipment, having to fight your way through enemies that, at first, seem very difficult, yet rising up to an entity that has no problems fighting anyone. a great, fast, high-action game, with lots of combat, (and lately, learning the enemies). if you like space ninjas with cool guns, swords, and armor, then this is certainly the game for you.",698.7
"it was very fun at the start but it got quite repetetive. i still like it except some features in the game are locked until you buy them with real money. cant argue with that though if its a free to play game. fun to play with friends or just solo. 7/10",62.4
"this is basically a fancy grind fest. the only polished thing in this game is graphics.",2.1
"i enjoy this game very much but there is still lots ot work out for game play wise. it is a very free base system in my mind. meaning that the direction isnt there really but i like that about it. it dosent matter how you gt your self through the missions as long as you do the steps needed. you can go back and forthe from the start of a level and back agian with out any problems. its fun but needs more of a story or maybe just a little more gam play depth. its a great shell but i feel its lacking. over all i love it and will continue to play. cant wait forthe updated later versions.",46.6
"can be a cit repetitive at times, but slicing a grineer in half is always satisfying.",54.1
"for a game like warframe, i wish there was a kind of recommend button. dont get me wrong, it can be fun, but this is a good example of how you can take the pay-to-play model and ruin a game. if you really want to be successful, you have to join a clan, but in order to join a clan, you have to have really good gear, but in order to get really good gear, you have to invest tons of play time or outright buy the stuff with real-world money. on top of that, its a little monotonous. however, it does have its moments, and its free to try, so its not like youre losing out on anything... unless you actually spend your money on it. 7/10, i guess?",482.5

"i loved this game look at my f#king hours! but in all seriousness its pretty damn awesome excluding the slight repetitiveness but you can oversee that while youre hacking and slashing or if youre a normal person shooting is good too. not to mention the game is not a p2w you can get everything excluding cosmetic and slots but that shouldnt stop you go download this game right now.",743.6
"you are an exoskeleton wearing, gun toting, space ninja with memory problems and awesome powers. do i really need to tell you much more? the game play is fast and fun. devastation is the name of the game as you turn enemies into piles of dust with a lightning gun, piles of shreaded beef with some claws, punch through them with a laser cannon, or even nail them to the wall with a bow (and hilariously break physics sometimes when you do) the powers of the warframes give you many tactical ways of playing. do you use the power of electricity with volt and fry enemies with lightning or do you take a rhino and laugh as they franticly try to take you down as you walk through the horde unfazed by gunfire due to your iron skin ability? maybe you like to take a steathy or fast aproach and choose the ash where you can blink behind enemies to finish them off and slice up an entire room with the push of a button using blade storm. in the end, its up to you. battle well, and win often",504.7

"if you like being a super powered ninja then this is the game for you! it features super suits that allow you to bend the elements (or the enemy) to your control, and gives you the ability to perform amazing stunts (like slash through 10 monsters at once). the only problem i can see is the time it takes out of your day to gain new items.",616.2
"warframe is really freaking fun. imagine a good 4-player co-op game like left 4 dead. now make it 3rd person, and add in a whole load more weapons, from magnums to assault rifles to boomerangs with spikes. and give those weapons a levelling option so you can add in extra traits like elemental damage, increased ammor or fire rate, or scenery penetration. then to finish off instead of redneck hicks or token female college students, make the player a magical cyberninja. in space. gameplay is fast and slick, and your warframe is very responsive. the core game is a huge amount of hacky-slashy fun, especially with friends. you can play solo and thats enjoyable enough now and then, but the game adds in more and tougher enemies the more players there are, much like diablo 2 did. you can choose one of three warframes at the beginning, but there are another ten to collect, which is mostly a matter of completing assassination missions that reward you with the requisite parts. you can spend real world money if you like, but its genuinely fun to run the same mission a couple of times because the action is pretty intense, and the levels are randomly generated, so surprises do happen. play warframe, its very enjoyable, and its free. what more could you want?",767.3
"this game is fun, however it can get repetitive quickly",106.5
"used to play this about a year or 2 back, was pretty cool but repepetive. im starting to play it again and its pretty sick, the game has changed like crazy and i personally love it. check it out.",9.2

"when i first started this game, i thought it was pretty awesome. i had a great time running through the missions and just playing with other people. then, i noticed the pay to win feature in later missions. thats probably the only thing i dislike about the game. for example, the first time i played with a player who payed to get a sentinel, his sentinel killed everything and all the rest of us could do was follow him. but, then i realized that even with players like that, the game still maintains a pretty good challenge of trying to out do them and just trying to win. tl;dr: its really really pay to win but still would recommend.",4.1
"sometimes there is lots of spagehti and its kind of scary how you can turtle on the wall like a cheetah. this game is not sometimes good, but maybe it is not, but it is. i like the space ninja that looks like a narwal. i would have rated this game a 10/10 but i didnt pick the narwal space ninja and now the game is crap.... i rate this game a -0.5/10",10.8
"17 hours in and i am not even level 2. the grind is hella real in this game but idk, some people like that or maybe i just suck. anyways, this game is such a cluster . you got some robot  looking protagonists fighting a bunch of stuff and you get a samurai jack blade and the parkour skills of a 13 year old british boy, and you are suppose to just go out it. i also got butt  over and over when i tried to go to the harder levels. i like it a ton ;)) 10/13",17.1
"outstanding game. this game is just so open it allows so many ways to play the game. not the mention the modding system and the variety of warframes you can play as. these developers (digital extremes) deserve a thumbs up and some support because the more u help them the more u get content!",459.4

"if you like a combination of grinding for items, shooting things in the face and magic missile, this is your game. the game can get pretty scary to delve into at first, but if you play the missions as they become available with public on, youre likely to get the hang of it fairly easily. end-game is constantly being updated and old content reworked. while it is free to play which includes a cash shop, you have the option of farming for almost everything in game. extra slots require payed currency, but de allows trading of this currency with other players for farmed items.",1266.7
"a repetative, samey third-person-shooter with no real entertainment value. the constant micro-managing of upgrades and the same enemies through the same corridors for the same missions over and over, doesnt appeal to me at all. worst of all is that the game locks your warframe when you choose it, and wont allow you to change it for a minimum of 4 days, and thats after youve spent hours searching for random drops for the resources you need to construct a new warframe. all-in-all, not a very good game.",8.3
"dont get me wrong, i love warframe, and i do recommend that you at least try the game, but through my experience with this game i have had nothing more than trouble. game play is awesome, endless hours of farming and grinding, it is truely an mmo players dream, however the game has far too many bugs that the support team refuse to do anything about, from constant log issues to frozen ui the support team always recommend you allow the game to run through firewall, no matter the issue. personally i find no use in firewall, it does nothing but slow me down, and i keep my computer clean, physically and digitally, so for me, i have no use what so ever for firewall and it is always disabled. still everytime i run into an issue while playing (which i must say, happens literally once or twice an hour) and report it to the support team, they always tell me the same thing, allow the system to run through firewall. but when i exclaim to them that this cannot be the problem i am met with an apology and instructions on how to allow a program through firewall. its a great game with a terrible support team. my enjoyment in this game would usually tell me to rate it a 10 of 10, but the constant problems prevent me from giving it any higher than a 5 of 10.",189.6

"absolutely love this game. i got disillusioned with destiny on the xbox one pretty quickly and a friend recommeded i try this. it is amazing. you can play solo or with other people. there is pvp and pve missions, and they have a lot of variety. tons of weapons, skills, abilities, mods, upgrades......ive spent almost 60 hours playing thus far and i am still just stratching the surface of this free game! i havent had to use any of my money so far, and i am a good contender in the pvp elements. would highly recommend this to anyone who likes adventure/action games.",220.6

"warframe was really fun for the first time, and it was pretty addicting for a while. however, once i started constantly grinding i began to lose interest for the game and end up not being interested in it anymore. from the short time ive played i ended up having 2 dreams and other stuff happening due to the tetris effect kicking in so quickly. its addicting as hell for a while, so i recommend it (so long as you dont mind reducing a few grades).",210.7
"unique third-person shooter game. i thought it was a mmo pvp battle, but actually its cooperative pve mmo tps game. the control is hard to learn, also the story is kinda hard to follow. but the gameplay is awesome, the graphic are sooo cool, it has crafting-like, also mods to improve the guns. but actually i hope it has pvp battle thing, because its going to be awesome.",6.2
"update. still one of the most awesome ftp games your going to find. would still highly recommend this game. there have been many gilded ftp games, being fun enough on the exterior of core gameplay just enough to get you hooked before essentially forcing you to spend money to stay relevant. this is not one of those ftp games. the only aspect that bugs me atm is that you have to have platinum to unlock extra warframe and weapon slots aside from the default amount they give you. that is only if you want to own more than 2 warframes, and you can sell frames and weapons to make room for others as you try them all out. although some of the more in depth features, such as polarising your weaponry, and building a clan dojo require hefty grinds, with 3 other team mates they are fun. all around good over the shoulder shooter",583.3
"this game..is awesome. everything can be crafted in game without using real money, it will just take a lot of farming, but hey, that adds to the longevity of the game. plus it gives you a chance to level up your warframe and gear. i find it alot of fun. at first i thought this game sucked cause i didnt understand it. give is a try and look up on thi excelent community wiki if you ever have questions. i hope to see you in game :)",135.5
"its a radical game about space ninjas goin round killin stuff. its not p2w, everybody has the same resources available, paying or not. so dont let others talk you into that. though the game is a bit of a grind at times. search (x) for (insert resource and/or blueprint here.) and build up the credits to create what you want. rng is a total hack, but dont let that water down your fun. overall; its a nice game to play with friends, or by yourself. money will make the game easier, though you dont have to at all.",856.1

"awesome fast paste game ... but the items you have to find is headache :( 7.8 out of 10",851.4
"one of the most fun games ive played in a long time. it gives the feel of an over the shoulder shooter while still sustaining that feel of an rpg. with the multiple choices of weapons, frames, and toys in the game one is sure to not become bored very easily. their is alittle grinding to the game to get some items but in the long run it doesnt take all that long really.",112.0
"warframe is a interesting game. it has a great story and conept. the gameplay is pretty cool. the best part is that warframe is free to play",20.5
"have you ever wanted to be a space ninja guarding the solar system from evil and preventing the enemy from getting the upper hand? well you ,sir, have just found the right game. warframe offers the opportunity to slice, splat, shred, flatten, set fire to, electrify, melt, poison or blow up your enemy. you can grow, yes grow, your own dog that can make a pretty easy meal of anyone or anything and you can build your own clan fortress on the very edge of the system that can house up to 1000 of your fellow players or tenno as they are called. i not only like warframe because you can do all of the above but because unlike most games there are no items that you cant craft or find, so it does not force you to buy any in-game currency to get anything decent. so its good for players (like myself) that want a good game and dont want to have pay anything to get to the top of the food chain. i would extremely recomend this game! 9.5/10",710.3
"its taking my soul away. great game! getting more equip for your warframes has never been so rewarding. getting new characters maxing them out is pretty fun nor get boring. heads up! the first few levels will seem like a drag, but it does get better.",151.2
"i bought a space gun using my space money, i used said gun on space zombies, i casted space magic on said space zombies, then i space ninjad my way to the space boss, where i used my space parkour and my space sword to space kill him, i then returned to my space ship were i rubbed the space belly of my space dog. today was a good day.",401.9
"at the beginning, you get some . you use that  to kill  to get more . its free and its awesome.",254.5
"it handles like mass effect 3s multiplayer and if you squint, you might think youre playing a game set in the me universe. for a beta, this is a beefy game. lots of characters to play as and weapons to kill with. there are over 100 missions to complete on various planets. im loving this game. havent had a bored moment yet! dont be scared away by the free to play tag. it is definitely not pay to win. everything in the game is accessible to free players with the only strictly purchasable items being cosmetic. warframe is the shining example of a f2p game made with the players in mind. now with pets!",219.6
"a really awesome fun game i recomend it to everyone!!!!!",40.9
"this game is beast! all i can say, the game has great graphics. awesome gameplay, mechanics. however when thats said, it gets boring after some hours, and you get a bit mindblown from the prizes of the stuff. also alot of the things costs real money.",30.0
"i heard this game was repetetive and even early on i can see how people say that, but it looks like theres a lot of depth to it and its interesting enough im gonna keep playing for a while.",100.3
"warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. after those few enjoyable hours youll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in its combat, enemies and game play. the one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the games systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. its a good game to play casually. though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. the upside to all of this is that the game is free so id recommend trying it out. if youre looking for a quick fix, try it out. there are better games out there.",22.7
"the life of a warframe player -gets game. -plays for 30 hours . -starts noticing the paywall. (dont you dare say there isnt. you need a catalyst/reactor to make your frame/ weapons do damage to anything over lvl 30. yes they drop in alerts but unless you want to wait a fortnight at a time at the chance of getting one you will end up putting money into it) -puts money into the game and it feels like a whole other game. -starts the farm for prime parts. -hits 600 hours and has all prime frames and weapons. -just sits there wondering why the  they just did all of that. ok for all of you saying there is no paywall they drop in alerts. you do realise they drop once a bloody fortnight. for a non casual player playing this that drop rate is too bloody small. you will gain more weapons in one week that you want to catalyst than the amount of catalysts drop in a whole damn year. next time read the damn review before you say they drop in alerts!",833.6
"best game i have played, not withstanding the fact that it is a free to play. but the free to play structure done right. has regular updates with free content with challenge to get also not pay to win. de ihas set the bar when it comes to a free to play game period. great community of people to play with never had a bad experience yet. also update 14 has made new user experience a much easier entrance to the game so go ahead give it a try, ninjas play free. i whole-heartedly reccommend this game.",148.8
"well let us start off by saying i am bad at writing reviews. as i was beggining to write this i tried to come up with some cons about warframe, but i could not do so. i gave it about thirty minutes and not even a hint of a con appeared in my mind. i would like to share my opinion on waframe before i list any pros. my opinion being that warframe is a truly amazing game. i did not think i would ever end up where i was in this game. at first i despised the idea of it, but i gave it a try. now everyday is a day of wanting to play warframe, playing warframe, and thinking about playing warframe tomorrow. people will always text me and ask me to hangout but i always say i am working or i am busy. however, i made new friends, perhaps even a family. it feels as if i have another life, a place to escape to. if that does not tell you that i love this game my current 851.3 hours will ( which will certainly be increasing ;d ). well since warframe is nothing but pros i will just settle by spitting out the larger, more positive attributes. some pros being: +great community +amazing graphics +phenomenal customization in both modding and physical appearances +certainly not a pay to win +perfect mechanics +always new stuff and fixes +joyful gameplay there is far too many pros to list, in my opinion. if you give it a real try you will probably become addicted. be ready to abandon your social life.

"one word.. awesome. among all the free to play games out there, this i would rate to be among the top 3. a very good co-op game-play mechanics with frequent updates from developers makes this game a must play.",394.2
"im still very new to this game, but its amazing. its like gears of war meets mass effect meets dead space. it has some of the most beautiful scenery i have seen in any game, but suffers from a lot of repeated textures and entire rooms. this is without a doubt a game worth playing.",18.6

"i reccomend all peoplle to at least try out warframe, it has a bit of a rough start, but once you get into it, it is an amazingly fun game. microtransactions are not required at all, and the only thing that cant be bought without money is slots and cosmetics.",904.3
"played this game for almost 2 days worth of time just to be banned for no reason what so ever. total waste of time really glad i wasnt stupid enough to pay these a$$clowns any money. for being a beta it definatly shows it. mass bugs and crashes alot.",44.9
"another free to play. ill admit this isnt the best of games, but its a fun game to play for a couple of hours every now and then. lots of weapons and upgrades, but unfortunately youll have to pay some money if you want the really good stuff. all in all, its fun but very very buggy. full of glitches, but the constant updates are working on fixing this game up. time will tell how thisll turn up.",87.1
"great game, youre nuts if you dont try it! plus its free :)",669.7
"mmo for short. probably next generation graphics. no high computer specs needed. great gameplay, futuristic, and a little but educating becouse of the planets you travel to. point is: -make you character -fight trought the defenses -kick  -have fun make you family or clan. craft items such as rifles, bows and other... didnt play much but i am satisfied my rate as always 10/10 many updates, carefull with patches and ig look. install it as soon as possible :d",5.2
"the game is alright for people who like pve. you can play in a squad of no more than 4 people. there is a fair variety of missions large ammount of guns and customization options everything than can be purchased on the market with real money can be found and crafted in the game with hardwork and luck. there is even some things money cant buy. pvp lacks something fierce. there is literally no point to it. the pvp in this game lacks the feeling of just completely obliterating your oponent. there is no real strategy and it just feels like a cheap cod arena. if youre looking for a pvp game. turn around this is not it.",1043.7
"very unique game that has a playstyle for everybody. much fun",321.8
"this game is a great third person shooter. there are a lot of items and lootables, and the mods and fusion system adds an extra layer of depth to the combat. there are some things that may put you off- one being that all the levels (save certain key points) use tilesets- the devs are adding new ones every major update, so it is getting much less noticeable. another putdown is the fact that you cannot get color palettes for you warframe without paying. i guess they have to make money somewhere! tl;dr: its a good game with cool mechanics but has some flaws that are being fixed.",527.7
"good action game, that evolves with every update. at the beginning it is a little lame, to have your wallet tortured, becuase you need money, to buy slots for your items. otherwise you would only have space for two weapons, and this is annoying, if you dont want to spend real money so fast... however, the game is good, but lacks of a great story... just the same missions all the time, but the progressing factor makes the game really enjoyable and it is the best game, for a long co-op session with up to three friends. the different powers of your characters makes teamwork be a quite good and fun making experience. however, after 750hours the game made me rethink the concept of the developers. the game is in beta status and instead of developming a release, the guys release a beta to other systems like ps4 and xbox one.... and the only thing that evolves is the money making updates of cosmetics and new weapons, or chars... and this sucks.... instead of developing the game, the creators develop updates with much more new bugs.... with the saying.. hey, we are in a beta... but why do they create new stuff, instead fixing the good old... after update 14 ive stopped playing, since i feel fooled by the developers.",756.2

"i spotted this game shortly before it came along on steam, and considered trying it out. i never got around to it, until it ended up on the front page of the steam store. the game is built on randomly generated levels, and allows a huge amount of customization for your playstyle. like running around wacking things? like teleporting around the battlefield? like picking off your enemies from afar? this game is for you. if youve got a few minutes, just download it and give it a shot. its easy to get into, and gives a lot of gameplay. the only downside ive found, if you can call it one, is that not all of the movements and special skills/attacks are described in the tutorial. i personally find this gives the player some things to experiment with, and grows the experience of working on getting some skill in the game. its free. itll run playably on my centrino 2 processor laptop. its less than two (2) gigabytes, and its about god damn space ninjas. why the hell have you not tryed it out yet?",459.0
"i am disappointed that this game is so underrated, i mean what can be more awesome than robots, zombies and ninjas in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaace!",714.2
"well. 371.2hrs on this game isnt much for those warframe pros. i recommend this game who loves to play farming games. farm farm exp farm every single thing to get those that looks really cool. but after so much time spent. waiting for foundries... i decided to stop... just... cant... stand it anymore. lots of new warframe shells are coming. and there are only 2 slots given by the game. need to buy with real money or sell stuff...well...uh... yeah. pretty much it. recommended... i have no life after playing this game",371.2
"this is a very fun action game, being an over the shoulder shooter and slasher where you can take the class of warframes, which are suits designed to give the wearer special abilities, be it super strength, telekinesis, invisibility, and many many others. this game is perfect for bored gamers on a budget and it is definately worth a try.",15.6

"this game really goooooood. one of the best f2p game i ever play. but damned steam will delete your entire warframe folder if you ever want to make a backup of it. please fix it!!!!!!!!",608.1
"its fun, and not necessarily pay to win. you only pay to get boosts but other people can buy it with credits they earned.",34.1
"best game i have ever played. always fun, even though its free the devs keep it uptodate, always providing new contect for the user. i buy in game purchases like platnum because it is needed, but its worth it! overall a great game for free, better than most paid games in my opinion. would reccomend.",267.9
"one of the best free to play games currently avalible. whats best is that all of the content is avalible if your willing to put the work in, and not an unreasonable amount of work like games. the major downside is that it requires a fairly good pc in order to look good.",291.5

"ive been playing this game since about update 8. it is by far the funnest game i have ever played. there is always something new to search for and there is always new stuff being added. it has quite a few bugs but they just make the game more interesting. and the best part is that while there is the freedom of playing with whatever setup you want. it is a very balanced and enjoyable game.",393.0
"dont get me wrong here this game is fun but it is the most annoying game i ever played. for starters the game developers use most of the game levels almost every time including dialogue. its the most annoying repetitive nonsence ive ever listened to in a game for the past year also id like to point out the combat. for starters sword combat blows so hard because when ever you tried to attack head on the enemy is like yeah right like that sword is going to hit me im gonna slap it out of yo hand complete bs. id give this game 510 not great not horrenous.",34.8
"i like it! pretty cool !!! worth a try if you have not given it one!",820.2

"diablo + crysis + space + ninjas = warframe. give it a shot, as its completely free (aside from cosmetics). grinding and repetitiveness plague it, but if you like dungeon-crawling-loot-hunting-monster-slaying-pseudo-rpgs, it comes with the territory.",375.5
"they try an get you to spend real money on revives after you die 12 times, otherwise when you die you forefit all your progress, and as a noob your gonna die. i uninstalled immediately after i realized this. what a joke, i can not believe the game is as popular as it is or that people would actually spend money on it. literally once u complete a few missions youve done everything the game has to offer. stay away from this game is my advice.",4.1
"good game, kind of boring in the first tries but when you play it long, youll discover its good as a bacon and a donut",296.1
"worth the money i put into it had tons of fun with friends id say its worth it. its not for everyone though there is some grinding for items but thats all the better once you make the weapons and stuff you did it for. lots of lvling if youre into that and different ways to buff out your character or weapons. as well as pets.",607.0

"ever wanted to be a space sci-fi ninja parkour melee sneakthief slidng running shooting badass? then download warframe! the story isnt the best thing ever but its still engaging and doesnt bore really quick. the controls are smooth as is the fighting. the feeling of chopping a grineer in half or blowing out the side of an enemy never gets old. plenty of weapons, upgrades, warframes, abilities, and other intersting things to keep any 3rd person shooter interested in for many hours. some levels are a bit easy, but it gets tougher. i havent played a ton of warframe but out of the 18.2 hours ive played, ive enjoyed all of it. 10/10 would recommend.",24.3

"game is great, the only downside to it is the grind. to build new weapons you need to grind for materials and to get better mods for your weapons for your weapons and armour you need to grind. the grinding isnt that mad though, go online and hook up with 1-3 other players and its no peroblem. highly recommended.",220.2
"ive played tons of f2p games over the years and while warframe isnt my normal mmo (i usually play rpg games) i have to say its definitely a game that constantly surprises and impresses me. ill admit i dont play it very often and ill get bored and quit for a bit, but each time i come back there is always something new and friggin awesome! digital extremes....you guys are top notch, keep it going :)",531.4
"excellent game. lots of customization options, many types of weapons and characters (warframes) with extremely varying abilities. you never have to pay for anything if you dont want to, either. i farmed everything and have built every frame by getting their parts myself. extremely gratifying and an amazing game!",1275.5
"fun and addicting, however to do anything you have to grind way too much. also on the rank up missions you can run out of ammo and energy and be left completly unarmed?? seriously, why? the enimies drop massive amounts of rifle ammo but almost no arrows so i cannot even complete the first rank mission becasue i run out of ammo and auto fail. fix this. the game is an 8/10 but could be 9 or even 10 if you fix the little things like that.",24.5

"when it comes to f2p (free to play) games people often tread carefuly as for the regular pitfalls (pay now and not get stuck in que and have a real game experience) warframe however seams to be apart from most f2p games in this regard a fun run and gun game style that is easy to learn and takes some time to be good at . a great coop game for some mates",526.1
"such a simple game yet so fun to play over and over. i find myself always coming back to warframe when all other games fail me, even if its for an event or for a new weapon. the game dose get repetitive in a sence but their always updating so it practicly never gets old or boring. player design 9.8/10 frost prime need more gold. level design 8.7/10 randomly generated levels of said types. ordis annoying the  outtah you when trying to be afk at liset, 2/10 seriously his jokes suck.",843.7

"thx god i never tried the beta, but anyways, i tried to like this game, i really did, but geez, those bugs, random frame drops,  enemies that look like they were made with mud or something like that, and is freaking pay to win in some aspects. the concept is great, i really liked it, but it was applied poorly.",25.0
"its fun if you like ninjas, space, or anything involved with this game really.",0.5
"warframe is a good sci-fi co-op mission game which has promising potential to be a great game but right now contains many annoying bugs which need to be fixed for it to be great. there is still much more room for improvement such as the user interface and animation set. if the developers can fix some basic issues, they will potentially have one of the best games of its genre. right now, i give this game in september 2014 a 7/10.",819.9
"warframe was a very good surprise, i used to play on the earlier stages of the game and it was a very good concept with great graphics but there wasnt much content at that time, so i took a break from it, but when i return i found a great f2p game with a lot of content and replayablity. the graphics are awesome, the looting, the teaming up with your clan/friends, you will get hooked once you understand the basics and then you want more and better. the only negative is the connection problems related to the strict nat issue, but im sure they will fix that and add even more content to the game. 4,6/5.",35.8

"it gets fun at first until you realize it is the same thing over and over and over and over again. different planet? same mission but theres snow! the only variety is the bossess and the warframes themselves. if you are someone who plays desinty and like endless grinding and repeating the same thing then this is the game for you but repeats and grinding isnt my thing",177.6
"warframe is a sci-fi based third-person shooter. it is a very fun game with replayable stealthy or action played levels. co-op mode is very fun and interactive apart from the fact people steal my kills >.<. other than that i like how i can change my armor, customize my weapons, and use different colors on my character and my trusty blade. me, personally i like to play it stealthy on all missions, but if youre not that type, thats your way of playing :) overall, i love this game with its parkour aspects where as i can run across walls to get to the other side of a pit of lava or acid and i can climd up on a box to straddle over a railing to find myself six feet from an enemy. very fun and lots of cool features i highly reccomend it to shooter fans. :)",15.8
"if you like ninjas... welp youre ing set this game is basically a saints row with ninjas! ninjas in space",135.6
"really fun game its a bit boring at the start but it gets better really recommend it 9/10 sad about the 60fps frame cap also amazing graphics",164.1
"i would definitely reccomend waframe to friends. its a fun, semi-cooperative third person sci-fi shoother. it has a great free to play system as far as free to play goes, its not pushy about buying and almost all items can be obtained without spending a cent. it also has content updates almost biweekly, with at least many updates since i joined in september/october. its alot of fun, and i would reccomend installing it regardless of if you want to spend a few bucks on it.",763.3

"as i read the description and saw some videos of this, i was a little interested,. so i downloaded it , not expecting much. this game has wowed me and if i had the choice between any new gen games, i would pick this. this game is more than just getiing new weapons and warframes, it is a game that has struck a cord in my expierence with games, and will always be on eof my favorites. with plenty of warframes, weapons, and equpiment, this game never gets boring. every mission is a new expierence and challenge, with or without friends or randoms. the clan system helps everyone, unlike most other games. with plenty of love/hate relationships with the bosses, this is a game for the ages.",97.0
"this game is super awesome although the multiplayer missions end up only being single player because the players are kicked.",6.0

"to kill time, 10/10 would play. its only fun if you play with friends you trust and know. but if youre tolerant to others, thats fine as well. solos also good but happiness would always be short-lived in this game. also a good game to screw around~",1010.7

"one of the most interesting projects of 2013 that flowed into 2014 that ive seen. the game has all what a gamer needs. guns, fancy karate gimmicks, swords. two words: space ninjas. what is actually good that the game even tho is f2p but it does not follow a shadowy p2w path. you might be confused in the beggining, as getting the stuff, crafting, locations and controls. but when you get over it, you might as well like it. another aspect that drives the attention. constant new content updates from very friendly developers. i might add that devs do take in considiration players ideas and implement ideas and throughts into a real thing. almost all the stuff ingame can be aqquired just by playing the game, you just need to get over the beggining. but this game is still in beta. there could be bugs, there could be flaws. currently devs implement tons of content every two months (aprox). in general this is a game that you might totally like or just play for two minutes and uninstall. playing with friends is recomended.",903.8
"mate, what a gem of a game. for free, this is well worth it. its not a  piece of freemium software either, this is a properly f2p game. so, heres the breakdown...",51.7
"warframe is a fun fast-paced pay to win rpg shooter, i recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay a bit or grind their pay to the top.",231.5
"pick up run-and-gun squad based shooter..great fluid animations, stunning graphics and plenty of sci-fi futuristic action with a splash of blood. im digging it :)",22.8
"although the story is really weird and hard to follow it stays fun from the action packed combat. the slow upgrading keeps you engaged and gives you a goal to work towards while you kill a mulitude of enemies with your array of weaponry, which ranges from pistols to snipers and even throws in a sword giving the player a sort of ninja-james bond feel. all in all what the game lackes in story it makes up in actual gameplay. id give 7.5/10",15.6
"this game is as awesome as it gets, but only if you enjoy coop, hack and slash with a little stealth, in a futuristic environment. there is no equal.",65.5
"great game, lots of things to do, however gets repetitive really fast.",80.6
"if you could change crosshair, the game would have its own sports channel within the next 2 mins and would replace tlc and probbably all the other junk cable channels.",868.0
"-      . the game is completely necessary to remove the use of machine guns and pistols - it nullifies the style of game. you need to create different modes of gameplay: level sweep speed, stealth, maximum damage, etc. add to the exterior of the characters individual items that are not part of the characters body: bags, antennas, ammunition you need mutch more effects in kills. enemies must to do something exept of just walking (every enemy). each enemy wants something, something must to do, etc. let enemies will be less, but every enemy becomes more interesting. the enemies have beds and toilets, a mess - a sign of life. more myths about ninjas in usual gameplay. the game will be alittle complicated but more interesting and exciting",2.7
"i needed something to keep me busy while waiting for destiny to come out on pc. . . found it!",118.3
"with the constant updates this game will never get old, the only problem i have is the limited inventory unless you practically buy a free game, but ignoring that fact this game is overall a great game with a large amount of lore, weapons, and well, warframes.",487.9
"this game in one word is addicting. very addicting. i started playing it and they i eventually found it hard to stop, in fact the only reason i took a break is because i was tired. this game is an mmorpg that you do not want to pass up. especially since it is free! in this game you can purchase things in game so that you have the tools you need to be the best tenno that you can be. the first couple missions warm you up and tap into that killer that lies dormant inside of you. you progress and as you progress you can purchase new things and become a better tenno. all in all i think this game is great and i have not even finished it yet. i liked this game and i think most people would too, so just give it a try and who knows maybe you will like it. i give it a big thumbs up and a huge five out of five stars.",17.3
"looks to be an awsome game that i cant seem to get away from lol. its free to play or you can buy some upgrades.",84.6

"i loved this game look at my f#king hours! but in all seriousness its pretty damn awesome excluding the slight repetitiveness but you can oversee that while youre hacking and slashing or if youre a normal person shooting is good too. not to mention the game is not a p2w you can get everything excluding cosmetic and slots but that shouldnt stop you go download this game right now.",743.6
"well... after more than 400 hours of playing this on steam and another 200 of playing on their louncher, i can say that the game got me. though it gets repetitive, if you can look over that and become part of the community, youll never get bored of it.",907.3
"currently played 45 hours and have 3 characters so by no means is this an in-depth review. this is a very fun action packed game, it can keep you entertained for hours however i do want to point out that it can be a grind fest and can get very boring very quick. level can repeat constantly with the only difference is having a different objective which can make it seem like youre playing the same mission again and again, but for some reason it didnt seem to bother me too much. trying out new characters different weapon and abilities keep the game feeling fresh. level 30 is the max level, however you can use forma to upgrade your warframe and then this causes your level to drop to 0/ unranked again. doing this allows you to add higher level/ more mods which allow your warframe to become stronger, now whats the problem? well this causes you to repeat missions over and over again which wouldnt be as bad if the mission were not already a repeats of the previous mission all in all this is a very good game, however there is a lot of repetitiveness!!!",57.0
"gomenasai, my name is vogue-sama im a 22 year old american otaku (anime fan for you gaijins). i draw anime and manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior japanese games. (warframe, world of warcraft, persona series) i train with my dual ether every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon in the solar system. i earned my sword license two weeks ago, and i have been gaining affinity every day. i speak japanese fluently, both jupiter and the saturn dialect, and i write fluently as well. i know everything about japanese history and their no-guns code, which i follow 100% when i get my jupiter visa, i am moving to neo tokyo to attend a prestigious high school to learn more about their magnificent culture. i hope i can become an animator for studio ghibli or a game designer! i own several warframes, which i wear around town. i want to get used to wearing zephyr before i move to japan, so i can fit in easier. i bow to my elders and seniors and speak japanese as often as i can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.",39.1
"this game is pretty fun, but their switching you from the easily killed grineer to the not-affected-by-punture-damage-deal-with-it corpus crewmen can be a shock for new players. there are a couple more problems i have with the game, such as the flawed stealth system. enemies are comically dumb, but they more than make up for it with their apparently psychic abilities. as soon as you fail to kill one enemy with a shot from the paris, they all know your exaclt location, and know where you are everywhere and at any time until you kill all of them.",28.8
"great game playing solo, but even better going at it with friends!",9.7
"probably one of the best free to play games ive ever played. doesnt force me to pay actual money to play, (everything ive bought was due to my own impatience), ive put over 100 hours into the game in only a week, and just wow on the fact that its only a beta just surprises.",491.6

"amazing game highly addictive would recommend for anyone who like ninjas in friggin space",310.6
"this game is quite fun, with decent gameplay mechanics, and an ok story. however, if you would like to play with your friends, on the multiplayer game, then be prepared for at least an hour of attempting to get into a squad with your friend, and get into a match, just to disconnect at the last second. also, be prepared to spend several hours gathering vast amounts of resources that have a infinitesimal drop chance, or pay enormous amounts of real money for things you want.",38.9
"not my cup of tea for the kind of game it is, but i still enjoyed the 4 hours of playing it.",4.5
"do you recommend this game? of course i will, because its damn good and fast action game. its about team work and you would not miss it because it is not like other games like pay to win. here, everything depends on your skills and reaction, about your accuracy and moving style. so go on and download it. you wont be disapointed.",16.4
"i wasnt impressed with the trailers., but its free to play, so i figured why not give it a shot. i have to say warframe is fast becoming one of my favorite games now. it is probably going to become my new main game. thats saying something. give it a try! character leveling, skill and weapon mods, crafting - if these are game features that appeal to you then you owe it to yourself...",1277.1

"this is a great game if your totally looking for a game with epic action and even better gunplay; when you join a guild you can research the new equipment that come out in new updates, so its not really pay to win. you can meet tons of people all across the globe that can help you get started, even if their are those few people who are complete jerks.",138.1

"so, other than my other reviews that make absolutely no sense and are pretty lame, i decided to make a somewhat logical review. i have lame jokes. dont hate. anyway, im gonna start with the good... im sorry... great things about this game. this includes: - a tutorial (which was changed in u14 to be somewhat helpful) which actually somewhat explains the game. - no main menu. instead, you get your very own ship. thats pretty much your main menu. - great animations. - great voice acting by the characters in the game. - amazing weapon mod system (i.e. give your weapon an explosion effect, make them get more critical hits, etc.). - very fun gameplay with randomly generated maps. - hours of content. - far from pay to win. - many more! however, this comes with a price, which includes: - can get repetitive a bit after a while. - most levels look similar, even though they have different tilesets. - movement can sometimes get a bit annoying. - you may have to grind for some resources. - etc. overall, this game is probably the best f2p game ive ever played. warframe is updated frequently with a very positive dev team and community. definitely recommended.",207.8
"love it, brilliant and really fun. graphics perfect, mechanics flawless but can end up being a grind.",454.5
"this game soo lol its only says update directx failed i look up the forums to fix it,the i tried and nothing happen",0.3
"this is one of the worst games i have ever played. it wouldnt let me quit during the tutorial part of the game and upon completing it, it crashed and restarted to the opening cutscene. the mechanics are incredibly sluggish and fragmented, nothing is smooth and intuitive controls are non-existent. the engine is bad and glitchy. it definitely feels like a console-port, though im not sure if it is. horrific, i want to vomit",1.0
"warframe, almost 800 playing. my first game since i used steam. played since the first version of the game. iv seeing it evolve to became a better and better game. all i can say is that this game is really fun to play, either solo or with friends (always better with frineds of course). maybe people can get bored if they play alot, but tis is one of this games that u will want to play later on. on my case i never get bored and collecting all weapons and warframes on the games is like a challenge to me that i have to complete. they keep adding new stuff, and biger and better everytime. i see a good future for this game. so i recommend this for the people that like this kind of fps game. and you can wallrun!!!",1058.3
"great game.. boring at lower levels.. but gets really (and i mean really) addictive as you progress in levels and in the game. it has fast paced gameplay and immersive environment. overall a good pick for shooting game lovers. :d",674.3
"at a time when many free-to-play games feature very unfair monetization, warframe is a breath of fresh air. firstly, it is one of the best looking f2p titles i have ever seen. secondly, the combat system is very enjoyable and the community is very active. thirdly and most importantly, the monetization is very fair in this game. you can easily work towards building any weapons in the game by sinking time into it or simply by purchasing it through the store. however, compared to games like planetside 2, gaining weapons and frames without spending money is a very feasible way to progress in the game. i would suggest supporting these developers - you can tell they love what they do. i highly reccomend this to anybody. cons: graphically demanding (but very well optimized).",318.5

"a lot of fun albeit repetitive. if youre looking to purchase additional warframes for plat, dont. its far more economical to purchase plat during steam sales or when you get 75% off during a login reward then buy the items you want from other players. ...or grind your butt off! nearly everything is available for free however the catch is that you only have a certain number of slots to store your frames and weapons. you can save additional platinum by getting items from alert missions. d/ling the wf alerts app is highly recommended. also, loki is amazing. choose that frame after your tutorial. the wikia is your warframe bible. there is theorycrafting and optimal character building in this game and youll find this reference highly valuable. complete maps then do nightmare modes for rare dual-stat mods. some are much easier than others and you can abort and restart if you get things like no shields opon starting the mission. hit me up in-game!",670.3
"great i just waisted 182 hours of my life... great time waister great fun great everything 10/10 would great again",182.4
"all around solid game. i gotta say i am a fan of digital extreme work. the story and setting are pretty cool, and the levels are designed pretty well and look great. the issues however are still being worked out but i find damning: 1) there should be more stages, many maps are repeated in the early game thus far. 2) it being a purely mulitplayer game means you have to work with other people to get some missions done. 3) many weapons are simply sidegrades which is good. though some weapons are simply overpowered as ammo drops are plentiful. 4) pay-to-win. what i mean by that is one can simply buy weapons and gear to get ahead. new suits are $5 to $20 and weapons are about $12. though you can find blueprints or use aquired currency to craft weapons yourself. 5) balancing issues! it is to be expected that the higher level suits would be better, but as i stated above anyone can buy a top tier suit and top teir gun and blow through other players in missions. 6) if you like pvp and want to get into it early on there is very little of it. 7) difficulty curve is like a bell curve. from the first three zones its as follows easy - prepare to die if you didnt grind - easy.",207.1
"do you like ninjas? do you like space? well this game has the two combined, space ninjas! its free to play but not pay to win!",89.8
"warframe, the ultimate free to play game. this game has brought me and my friends much fun from just defeating a unlimited amount of hordes that consist aliens known as either the corpus or grineer. while playing this game, i wondered why this game is for free? it has desired gameplay, good graphics, and incrediable looking weapons. as well while knowing that you can spend cash on items; its best not to, since you can already unlock after completeing certain objectives if your patient. for the designing company who made this, thank you, for my laptop is just lucky enough to play this apple of eden. an the only negatives i can see this game are that the game can get boring if your not fond of having to repeat the same goals - though ive come to understand that most games are, therefore i enjoy this game. 8.7/10",85.7

"this game is a grind fest, linear, and boring after a couple of hours... ive been raiding the same planet over and over again for just one component i need for a weapon... never got it... you can buy... buy weapons and upgrades for money.. or their platnium currency. this game is just boring... oh hey but you can jump off walls and stuff like a ninja, ok thatss fun until it gets boring.. which it does.. if your going to play this be prepared to grind all day and night for 2 months for a couple of pistols and maybe a katana.. and its boring after the first week.",20.2
"the game is extremly fun but almost impossible to beat solo, it also is borderline pay-to-win but its pve unless you go to the pvp sector. i shot a guy with an arrow, he then flew back hitting 3 other guys making them all stick to a wall overall 8.5/10",395.8
"graphically engaging, fastpaced, dungeon crawler-esque, rpg elements, and overall a good time. if youre looking for those things, look no further, and download warframe!",1.1
"this game has a good story line and even greater game play to it and the game has it own orignal idea. the devs puts out a update regalerly and hotfixes with in the hour of findding out there is a bug. the only thing most people will have a problem with it thats 12 hours to make a new gun and about 3 and a half days to make a new frame but it is well worth the wait. the combat is fast and the map are randomly put to gether with perset tiles and no map is the same as the last. the grinding can get slow and boring at time but if you get some frineds or random people you can make it less of a grind and more of how long can we last in a survival mission. there are alittle over ten different mission types from defence where you protect a cryo pod to killing a hvt and survival where you need to keep the enamey busy for as long as you can while keeping you life support levels above 0%. i recommand this game because of the different and origanal idea it brings to this current game marcket where you only find zombie survivals, fps and over all strange game types.",797.2
"awesome game. puts you immediately in the action. so addicted already.",932.4
"fun free game where you dont have to pay to have a good time.",694.3
"a quick jump-in-and-play level style. unique and interesting looking characters/frames that are far enough removed from modern stereotypes and standards to be interesting and creative. the gameplay is very fun and (almost) supports several types of play. if youre playing in a pug, expect to just rush in and kill everything. but if youre playing alone, or with friends, you can stealth through the mission, sneaking up behind guys and killing them before they see you, or combining certain powers from different frames for maximum effectiveness. you can collect and equip mods which let you use one of four powers for your frames, as well as mod your weapons to have different powers and effects. you collect resources in missions that let you build new weapons that you buy the blueprints from the marketplace for, and defeating bosses or special missions gets you blueprints for frames or special weapons. theyve recently added a codex to the game which allows you to properly make a collection of every enemy type and mod so you can see more information about them and have more to work towards. the only part of this i dont understand is why platinum or buyables are so freaking expensive. it completely turns me off the concept of buying anything instead of working ingame for it because its not at all worth the amount paid. having said that, i have bought platinum, but at high discounts on various sales.",413.4
"its actually a fun game (even though my escape button doesnt work) to play with your friends or if you dont have any then yeah",17.0
"ninjas, fps, assassins, more ninjas what other can i say? very fun game that you can play solo or with friends since you can create your clan or play some missions with friends :) p.s. did i mention ninjas? yes? katana then? shuriken? yeah! it also have those weapons! it even has bow!!!!",510.4
"great game. a variety warframes, weapons, cosmetics, etc. best f2p game i ever played",136.5

"farmframe is a very farmy game that allows you to collect all kind of materials to craft new weapons, for which youll need to farm more xp to level up. with your brand new leveled up weapons, you will be set to farm a few more materiales to repeat the proccess! truly an amazing experience.",232.4
"the game is really fun there may be some things that cost money but if u work hard u can get it without spending a penny",176.2
"great game. can get repetitive at times however. business model as f2p game is fair but hard.",315.5
"this is the first free to play game that i have ever spent money on. normally these kind of games would have to pry my money out of my cold, dead hands, but this game. wow. excellent graphics, lots of different game modes (aka mission types), cool music, lots of awesome guns, swords, blades...the list goes on. this is a 3rd person co--op space ninja shooter/slasher. theres parkour elements (with parkour 2.0 coming up), sneaking (thanks to spy missions 2.0), 3-d space flight (think zone of the enders), intense boss fights, awesome endless missions in survival and defense, and the list goes on. and you know the best part? its totally free. and there is no paywall. in-game currency can be earned by going to void missions, then gaining and selling prime weapons in trade chat. ive head of players gaining something like 5,000 platinum from this method, which is more than enough to buy you 2 of almost everything. however, on the negative side, while there is no paywall, there is a grindwall. void missions require keys, which are dropped from regular missions and as rewards from low tier void missions. once you get the key you want, and complete the mission, there is a list of 4-8 possible rewards you might get, so trying for the blueprint for that new frame that just came out can be a bit....trying at times. however, it is absolutely worth it. every frame (aka character), every weapon, and every game mode and map can be accessed without paying a cent. how many other f2p games can say that?",899.3
"new content every week (almost). third person shooter unlike any ive ever seen. want to reach the top without spending a single cent? definitely possible. beware the rngods, though.",477.9
"this is a nice game. easy to gain xp. becomes harder the higher lvl u are. you can do everything that is in this trailer.",101.6
"very polished game. pretty much borderlands meets metal gear rising. class selection is phenominal. weapons are great. the 4 player co-op is exeptionally smooth and is very fun.",64.3
"really laggy and slow. motion is blurry and super fast. its a great concept go! just have to iron out bugs and movement as well as aiming.",13.9
"i love it :o its the best check it out ... they also have ps4 version also so dont forget to check it too.",4.6
"i used to love warframe very much. but then, when ive unlocked sedna and phobos, enemies are tougher to kill, enemies can airborne while warframe cant (not archwing) and enemies weapons can damaged your shield very fast. mine was from 900+ shield to 200- within 10 seconds on rhino equipped with steel fiber ranked 8. i did cashed out from money to purchase some items. i realized that its all a waste! theyre uselss! only for f***ing decorations to make looks cool and awesome not the weapons! dont cash out some money for platinums! its a waste for money! i couldve buy other games like far cry 4 or sniper ghost warrior 2!",197.9
"set in the far reaches of outer space during a new dark age, warframe introduces the tenno, a race on the brink of extinction after being enslaved by the grineer for centuries. this game is very addicting, play as a space ninja running around throwing energy and running up walls. defend against a ton of different mobs, grind for hours and craft new weapons and frames. the community is awesome and the gameplay is amazing. i would highly recommend this and we havent even touched on the graphics. the only problem i can think off is that the dlc is overpriced, just my opinion. otherwise this game is 10/10!",80.6
"im mixed, leaning more towards positive. the game is fun, although it is sort of pay to win. pros -it looks nice -gameplay is fun and rewarding -fast paced cons -pay to win -waiting times -a bit too easy for my liking",29.6
"i cant stop playing. the first couple of days is the hardest but if you stick to it and play you will be rewarded with fun",229.1
"recommended. its really a great start for a f2p. plus it has so much fantasy to offer. the graphics are really that great. boss fights are really okay. role playing and third person shooting combined. the only thing lacking is the storyline and environment. gameplay, excellent for my opinion. go on, try it. see for yourself.",267.9
"it has a nice concept, but the view for shooting is a bit strange, the mechanics are a bit laggy, and each mission is more or less the same thing",40.1
"run arround, shoot dudes, spend hours making for yourself fabulouuuuus, annoy your friends, set off trip-lasers, get stuck in walls, fall off the map like a double ended portal drop, and so much moooore. this game offers a huge variety of stuff to choose from and develop how you play and what you want to play. pretty much all the gear is equally viable to get the job done /well i mean braton-mk1 is total trash compared to say soma or karak but ya get my point/ as well as provide an ample chance to see if you like that weapon style or not. you can play through this game totally free, its really just buy plats to save time, like how reactors and catalysts are only aviable every other friday or you could buy a couple for some plats(p2p stuff). theres plenty of missions, alerts, events and the devs are really dedicated to keeping warframe so to speak a living thing constantly evolving and changing. in the few years ive on off played it, its changed enough times for me be baffled between hiatuses. hell today the big up.15 (time of writing) came out and left me quite suprised at all the changes. so id really reccomend this if you like 3rd person shooters with a fast pace, giant variety, and a pretty interesting community.",1029.2

"are you kidding?! the games awesome, you can loose yourself in this one! the only thing i hate is that theres no way to earn platinum. it either has to be bought or traded for. im not even seeing a free give away here. kind of frustrating, but then i cant blame you, would probably do the same thing to get back a return on my investment. and, certain blueprints are nearly impossible to find (ie, forma).",230.7
"this game is absolutly amazing no complaints at all besides lowering the cost of some of the platinum items a tad other than that kep up the good work!!!!!",110.2
"this game has some great ideas implemented but mechanics let it down. this game has not that good graphics (seriously if you want to play a f2p with awesome graphics, planetside 2 is for you), very awkward movement, awkward shooting and camera view. i mean there is no programmed cover! however, this game has provided me with great memories playing with friends. you should play this game with friends. 6/10",1.6
"this game is filled with ups and down but over all the gme is very good in all the aspects of the fight and firefights i verymuch enjoy this game and will being playing this game until my eyes bleed but i dont think i will let it get to that point althought i cant make any promises so if your thinking about playing/downloading this game do it is seriously awesome and i recommend it to everyone i know!!",300.4

"if you like farming sims, you will love this game.",250.8
"great tps/action/stealth game. good game with fast action, intense, varied combat with interesting enemies that range from alien marines to strange creatures. big world to explore with beautiful locations. melee combat is my favourite feature here with my new sword and the fantastic gore that feels great to slice enemies open. i also like the space ninja theme here too. good customisation, good progression. totally recommended",20.7
"a lot of fun and pewpew action for f2p game. you cant lose there.",158.2
"its a really good game considering its free to play. i would definitly recommend it to people if they asked me, there is alot of action intense gameplay as you progress and lots of great characters to choose from. at first it seems a little slow and grindy but when you work hard for what your aiming for it really makes it seem worth while, where as some games just hand you the best stuff in a day. definitly a good time killer when you get bored, or you can always play it in between games.",231.5
"warframe is a game unlike any other. it mixes rpg elements with 3rd person action. this game streamlines movement with melee and ranged attacks like no game before it. the best part to all of this is that this game is free to play. you can aquire nearly everything through gameplay. spending money only speeds up the process of accumulating warframes and weapons. if you like this game, i reccomend supporting them by purchasing some platinum because these guys keep working on this game, always releasing groundbreaking updates. looking for something unique and fun? just give warframe a try and i promise you will appreciate it.",334.1

"this is potentialy the best free-to-play games out there at this current time.... it has a rather interesting mix of themes that wouldnt usually match, but in this they do. i play this regularly with friends and will continue to do so. parkour, ninjas, aliens, robots, just perfection. 8/10",18.4
"a wonderful free to play game that doesnt shove microtransactions down your throat. what more can be asked?",4.5
"what can i say? this space-ninja based game caught my eye and life. playing with friends hasnt been more fun, running through different instances such as spaceships, devastated debris fields, ancient ruins, all with one purpose: cutting off infested zombie-like creatures, robotic grineers or energy wielding humans. and blowing everything up with each different warframe unique and epic ability. with a huge arsenal of weapon variety, different mods to customize your playstyle accordingly for each frame, makes the posibilities endless. although it sometimes can get repetitive, like power leveling, farming, and non stop killing, theres this thing that keeps warframe so good over the years: the constant and non-stop updates and events from the developers, de. fun with friends, get three teammates and have a great laugh killing everything on sight. if you like mayhem: you got it!",814.7

"this is a stellar f2p game. very fluid looks great, gets you hooked just like a well made game should thanks digital extremes this is a great game. my only quarrel is the market pricing seems a bit off, some things seem to expensive or too cheap for the effort involved in building vs. buying.",284.3
"this game is pretty good. it needs some work, but its free to play so its definetly worth playing. i like the co-op game play, but a few things to fix: -sometimes the achievements dont work -personally, i think the melee button is in a bad place -make the waypoints less confusing",3.3

"a fantastic timesink, the developers are responsive, albeit a little slow when it comes to fixing critical issues, but they appreciate and use community feedback. late game becomes a farm-fest (which isnt neccesarily a bad thing) and the community is great for the most part. gameplay is fast paced and smooth and while the story is lacking, remember it is in beta (although in my opinion the little story it has is all it needs). overall, warframe a great co-op game that people of any skill level can pick up and enjoy.",407.5

"its like borderlands, but less focused on the story and more focused on the coop gameplay, and a lot grindier. you grow your warframe to be powerful enough to wipe huge hoards of enemies and blow  up. pros: - tons of different guns (and my favourite: bows) and melee weapons and even more mods to modify them - fun and satisfying gunplay / gameplay - many warframes (each warfame has different abillities) - very fair free to play model - endgame and many events cons: - grindy - can become repetitve - its like cocaine but in the end you are still a badass bloodthirsty alien god.",128.4
"this game is really great. the only thing that could be upsetting is that at times you may want more power with your weapons and you just will not get it unless you mod your weapons or find all the parts for your blue prints. it can be very challenging. i feel almost like i cannot avoid taking damage, but you can definitely deal damage. all in all, i do enjoy this game and it is holding my interest. also, it is a plus that you can pve in it unlike some other free-to-play action games.",10.1
"cool shoot em up ! check it out its free and looks very good on a 7xx card",1.0
"rating: 8/10 overall a fun game, but for new players it can be difficult to get into. for the first couple hours of the game, you will be using the same boring weapons until you buy/craft a new weapon using blueprints. you can run on walls, fly kick, slide, and perform devastating melee combos. fun game to play coop with friends!",68.6

"game is awesome,warframes creative and different,pay to win is present but its not hard to unlock stuff without paying.graphics are nice as well.if you want to avoid paying first youll need a weapon/warframe blueprint,then materials,then you need to wait for it to build.it takes about 12 hours to build a weapon and about 2-3 days for a warframe.of course you can speed up the procces but guess what.it costs platinum which you get by paying in real money.(you start with 50 platinum).big downside is that there is almost no different enemies.about three f****** races.but you still dont get bored.besides that there are clans,each clan with its of dojo.that is some sort of a construction that clam members are building.but again,to get an dojo key(which is required for entering a dojo)it goes the same blueprint system.all in all get the f****** game",17.8
"(review may be subject to changes as the games still in beta) + no paywalls. a very important thing in a f2p game. + the games fun. + fluid combat and movement. + good graphics. + lots of weapons to choose from. - the entire game is a grindfest. the only goal in this game is to increase your mastery rank and get more weapons to grind with. amazing. - no dedicated servers with high bandwidth and pc performance requirements for hosting. this turns most public games into unenjoyable lagfests. - ridiculous cash shop prices on warframes and weaponry. - major balance issues with all equipment in the game, especially with new weapon releases. which essentially is power creep. - no variety. - no real difficulty. most of it is just artificial difficulty with stat increases. - community lacks brain cells. - terrible pvp. yes, pvp is just a thing that was added because everyone asked for it and its definitely not the focus of the game, but that doesnt mean i cant criticize it. - nonexistent ai. - no endgame content. warframe has had a lot of potential which it showed back in early open beta. however, the game has taken a turn for the worse with more and more grinding and power creep put into it. its a fun game to play at first, but as you progress and increase your mastery rank, you will notice that the only thing youre doing is grinding your  off. 75/100",79.9

"so i played warframe a lot during the beta. maybe a little to much to where i out did my self on the game and then it just got boring. it started to get boring though when shotguns came into play and anyone who had one could whipe the floor of any mission. later on i come back and see they changed everything. while some is nice i hate most all of the changes made. not to mention the gameplay is still boring however all co op style games are boring and are even more so if one person is able to do all of the work for you. kinda like boarderlands 2 its dull as hell. i havent yet beat it because after the first 30 mins its just straight up boring to me. warframe is fun playing it alone though as a single player or sometimes with one other person if they do not have something overpowered. i got this one guy in my clan into the game...he is addicted. he has over 3k almost 4k hours into it.",172.5
"warframe is a rpg-shooter in a sci-fi space scenario. the player can choose between different forms called warframes with special abilities. while a warframe can be equipped with mods (attribute enhancements) the player can chose between dozens of weapons for ranged and melee combat. the difficulty of warframe is very low. new players have a hard time but after the first 30-50 hours of gameplay the game becomes very easy and repetitive. there are no rewards for mastering a missions in a short time or suriving very long. endgame doesnt exist because it is not rewarded by any means. the overall financial strategy of this game is to restrict items by one-time events, forcing people to trade them for real money. this includes more powerfull mods and weapons. while this concept works well for people who have no real life schedule, it doesnt work for casual gamers.",660.7

"this game is awesome. really, really awesome. i got trapped by a horde of enemies, aimed at a big guy about fifty feet away, switched places with him, then commenced to shoot and slice my way through the swarm. also you can cut people in half. this game definitely has the best blend of melee and gun play ive ever seen in a shooter, and its worth a try just for that fact alone, because the combat feels awesome. switching seamlessly from dual fire pistols to twin glass swords to finish an enemy off with a horizontal bisection never gets old, and the parkour system is just icing on the cake. not to mention the amazing weapon variety, ranging from freeze rays to boomerangs. fair warning, though: it can get repetitive, so, unless you have friends to play with, it may only be fun in small doses at a time, but it is very fun.",34.1

"warframe is a free 3rd person instance based mmo, to truly get into this game it requires more time than i have put into it so dont solely base your opinion on this game off my review. warframe in my opinion takes a long time and a lot of grinding to start having fun with.. you begin with basic equipment and weapons that arent horrible so you not left that far behind, but you will soon be grinding constantly for your next weapon or suit. the game itself has a very loose story and backstory that you dont have to pay any attention to if you dont want to. your character is tenno and you play as a warframe or in my eyes just a fancy coloured mech. each warframe has certain perks and 4 special abilities and you take on typical mmo roles of damage, tank and healer. the artwork is actually pretty good for a free to play game, its very colourful and can even look pretty but because you are always moving around very quickly or getting mobbed by enemies you dont really get time to have a good look. to be honest its a very good game but its just not for me. i would suggest that if you were to start playing, get some friends who have already played to either teach you or carry you through the lower stages of the game. i rate it 8/10",18.4

"once i had regained my password, warframe had still turned out to be a grind. you will spend ages rerunning levels and hoping for drops for specific pieces or patterns to unlock equipment. for those of you with fat wallets and little time to earn the gear legitimately, you can pay to unlock the weapons. its a bit of a shame none of the vanity items can be earned in game though. luckily, the game is still fun in a very visceral sense. gunning down grunts while they swarm at you on defensive missions is one of the best parts, though it does appear theyve rebalance a large portion of the game since i last played. the emergence of a story that does not require you to go browsing forums and creators notes is refreshing as well. 7/10 would be better if you didnt have to spend so damn long (or so damn much) to unlock some of the gear. seriously. stop charging so damn much.",541.5

"not what you expect, but in a good and bad way. mainly bad. when the game isnt pouring instructions at you over and over without telling you how to do it, or when the game decides you dont need to see so it puts up a talking face, the game is good. gamplay: 6/10 fustration for game: 11/10 the lack of showing you how to do things and objective markers that move, make the game already harder than it is, with overpowering damage from npcs. another great thing is that if you want to get any weapons or gadgets/mods, you pay real money! other then the fact nothing costs the money you get from missions, even if you do buy the blueprints with this. you have to play a sokid few hours to even get the components to make it, which it also doesnt tell you how to find components. overall, i give the game a 4.5/10",5.5

"if you hate pay to win games you may not like this game at all, however, everything you can buy with real money (except vanity items and boosters) can be earned through grinding (though the grinding is pretty intensive), so if youre willing to put in the time, you may never have to spend a dime. however, i would recommend putting money in simply because this game is still in beta but plays like a released game, minus a handful of bugs. the gameplay itself very addictive and fun, especially if you like to play with others in a shooter-run-and-jump-melee-fight style. the videos here on the steam market just dont do the game any justice at all. but dont take my word for it, the game is 100% free to download with zero commitment so download the game and give a go some afternoon and judge for your self. heres a tip: if you do decide to try it, while the game is downloading, visit the warframe wiki. the game is still in beta and tells you very little on what to do outside of the basic controls so theres a pretty steep learning curve, but the wiki is chock full of info on every aspect of the game, this will give you a bit of direction and a heads up on whats happening and what you should be doing to start earning goodies.",34.7

"ever wanted to be a ninja? ever wanted to fight stuff in space? ever wanted to do both at the same time? if so then warframe is the perfect game fore you. a massive variety of weapons, gamemodes, areas, enemys and charecters means that youll still be playing warframe years form when you starte. combine that with weekly updates and youve got the game that just keeps getting better. hope to see you in the starchart tenno.",1.7
"early thoughts (still playing): warframe seems like a fantastic game! looks fantastic and has great gameplay. the controls are quite a handful however im sure the more i carry on playing this game, the more ill get the hang of it. i definetely recommend this game to anyone who loves action games and for anyone else it is definetely worth at least a try.",0.8
"1.play 1st misson. 2.grind 1st mission for cool weapon 3.realize its a crappy weapon. 4.life wasted",4.7
"this game is amazing. most maps are very fast paced(except defense missions). this is mostly a pve game. you can tell right away that this game is made by passionate developers who really care about making a good game, and if you spend some time on their twitch channel and get to know some of the people who put this game together...youd definitely see that. the game gets frequent updates, with loads of new content. the mechanics of the actual game are nice. the mod system is ok...i like the extras you get from mods but it will definitely take you a while to sift through your thousands of mods to figure out which ones you want to use. the crafting system is nice, i actually do like that it takes a day or two to craft stuff. my biggest complaint would be the limmited inventory space, limmited character space....this is designed to piss you off and make you purchase more space. as a free game though, you can definitely enjoy the hell out of it. there is a decent variety of game modes in this game but after a while it does start to feel like a grind fest...with not much reason to be one...because you dont need the extra stats to beat everything. but thinking about it more...itd be really difficult to create the ideal system with that in mind. the other thing i really like about this game is they have events going on all the time, to spice things up, but you can also get really useful items that normally youd have to buy from the shop. ps. lotus is a total babe.",312.6
"warframe is a great game overall, its custamizable and rather unique. playing with people always makes the game more fun, and the warframse abilities work well together in most cases. i would deffinitly recomond this game to people.",162.2

"remember the first trailer for dark sector that showed that the game was originally to take place in space and in the far future? well digital extremes decided to take the concept of that early version of dark sector and make a completely new and free to play third person action title out of it. and so warframe was created. you play as a member of the alien race known as the tenno, a slight nod to the protagonist in dark sector, who has been summoned from the dark reaches of space to the galaxy to fight the evil grineer who are out to take over the galaxy and also wipe out the tenno at the same time. but youre far from helpless in your struggle, you have a special battlesuit called a warframe, each one of them have unique abilities that can turn the tide of battle in your favor, a wide array of firearms and several types of melee weapons, all of which are powerful enough to cut an enemy apart with one single powerful swipe. and you will also be fighting alongside other tennos in your mission to rid the galaxy of the grineer as well as any other alien race that intend to wipe you out.",19.0
"great game u should try it thats all i have to say",99.3
"the free to play aspect can be completely ignored if you put your time and effort into the game. it really isnt hard at all to get the items you want once you know what youre doing.",277.2
"after 300 hours, and $30, put into this game, i think its fair to say i recommend it. the graphics and physics are amazing, the missions challenging with plenty of combat options, huge list of weapons and equipment (some of which are exclusive to paying customers). while i cant really comment on the new archwing pack (havent built it yet, so going according to pre-patch). as far as story, its decent: you play a kind of void-preserved warrior from an old era of war, and then put into stasis as you were no longer needed. its now centuries later, and the system is being torn apart, so your skills are needed once again, often at the behest of the enigmatic lotus (remnant of the old era?). so, yourself and other players wake up and start the never ending struggle of saving the system. so, the story is a bit loose and open to interpretation. but, the part that stands out the most is the addition of new weapons, mods, equipment, and armors (seems to be new ones added every 4-6 months). so, the combinations for mischief and mayhem are boundless, and thats where this game shines the most. overall, i give this game an 8.5/10, as they are still improving the game.",365.5
"as others put it so very well. ninjas...in space. this exciting fast paced shoot-em up run-and-gun styled, third person squad ( or solo and anywhere inbetween) parkcour simulator will leave you with your wrist stinging from playing several hours longer then you intended. and beileve me, if you get into this you will play it untill you drop. the hours ive spent in-game were well spent. doubley with friends. it can get grindy. espeically for good weapons and warframes ( new playable characters ) but the time spent normally passes quickly ( again with friends ) and the rewards are actually worth it. my reveiw is a doubled handed thumbs up. i found the game to be action packed and intense, albeit a tad glitchy at times. but thats where the funny, funked up magic happens ( fallout players will know what i mean ) but by far, the very best part of the game that i like, is the very thing the game advertises  ninjas play free. all weapons, warframes, mods, and as you play through a year customization options are all avalible for absolutly free. the option s there however to buy it, and get it without trying. but cmon now who has fun pushing the a button to win? so in conculsion. warframe is a ninja game. a free tp play. non-pay-to-win, ninjas flipping in space action packed splosion festivel anygamer can enjoy.",512.6

"ive barely played 3 hours and just finished the first couple of missions where youve gotta go after vor or whatever. i killed him, and now can completely see this game is grind heavy. if i wanted to grind through a game, id go for a game with at least some open world features and maybe a tad bit of story like oh i dunno, wow. this game is just murder porn with half a story and a grind thats completely unaddictive. this game could be more, but really its the same crap with no variation.",3.2

"update 14 has really made the beginning of the game more playable. i would absolutely recommend it now. pros: lots of customizations you get to feel like you earned your new gear plenty of variety interesting gamemodes great opportunities for teamwork each update brings a brand new ui cons: crafting new stuff *sometimes* requires days of grinding crafting things also takes time (i.e. 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, etc) you only get a limited number of weapon and character slots people can pay to buy pretty much anything with real money, which sort of kills the sense of accomplishment for people who earned their gear",403.1

"its an interesting game to play: slash, bash, shoot, loot, all the stuff youve come to expect. it also looks really good except for a few glitches. however, dont expect much of a story or any driving force to do anything because you will basically be farming to unlock cooler stuff later on, such as more warframes, better weapons, etc. and try not to waste your platinum, because thats the way they getcha monies. but if youre only interested in doing cool ninja stuff and becoming an amazing bad***, go on and play already!",40.7

"i could lie to you and say that this game respects your time, and encourages you to go outside and live life. but that would be lying. and i dont lie. this game is so much fun. the 3rd-person shooter gameplay is extremely tight and engaging, and the free-to-play model is fair. you can craft a wide variety of weapons and warframes (classes) without spending a dollar. this is coming from the perspective of someone who has only put 40-some hours in this game (at the time of this review), and i could honestly say i dont feel pressured to spend yet. try it. its free, it looks damn beautiful, and its even more fun with friends. just, be aware that it is a very grindy game if you do go through the no-spending route. (it takes quite a while to gather the materials you need). i could only imagine it will only get grindier the more you play, but trust me, whatever time you do spend before you hit that wall, it will probably be great!",164.1

"whats most important here is that the game is free and its fun. if your computer can manage the graphics, you have nothing to lose by giving warframe a shot. if youre the min-maxing type or any sort of person who likes to break down systems into a series of personal goals, you have no barriers between you and many, many hours of enjoyment. for my part, i had a fun several missions, but it became clear that i was playing and trying to inhabit a world of people who were much more ready to invest time and grinding into something that wasnt giving me the payoff i needed to keep going. i never felt much of a sense of direction once the repetitive nature of the missions was revealed.",15.9

"not exactly a co-op game. game is typically played in teams: yes. but players all charge on ahead solo to try to grab kills. most of the game is spent chasing down other team members who kill so fast that theres nothing for you to do, or if you get ahead, you kill everything and everyone chases you....",1.9

"can honestly feel pretty addicting sometimes. they fixed the issue of feeling like you never had enough money (by letting you earn lots of money in randomly spawned events). the guns and melee weapons are fun, if annoying to find a combination that actually works well. progression can feel slow at times, which can be aleviated with an injection of cash, but damn near everything can be aquired through game play alone (if incredibly difficult due to randomness and availability of certain random items) the most frustrating part is how long new warframes take to aquire. you have to farm/buy 4 different blueprints that take 12 hours (three of them can be crafted simultaniously) and then you need to combine those three parts in a 3 day (physical days that is) for your warframe to complete. and even then a free account is only given two slots for warframes at any given time. this is odd as theres ample slots for weapons, but not even enough to let you experiment a bit. but dont let my nagging fool you, it really is a fun game for the most part. definately worth the free cost if youre willing to invest the time. plus, you get to be a friggen gun toting",172.0

"i did not like warframe, its short, missions are repetitive and buggy. for example, one mission i was trying to find and capture 2 guys. first of all the minimap icon for the guy i was supposed to find was not right and then someone else finished the mission then every enemy went after me. if that isnt bad enough, the crafting is not well thought out. to craft things, you have to farm for rare materials that you can rarely find, or the thing you are looking for is on a planet that have enemies that are 5 levels higher than you. and if you think you can just buy wepons from the store, then you are wrong. most, if not all the good items, require real money to buy, so i take this time to mention that the game is free to play. my final complaint is that there is little to no cover in the game and only one enemy has a melee only attack. and if thats not bad enough, than listen to this, i am not completely sure if there is a crouch button. so all and all dont get this game. its not as good as it looks. if you are looking for a game like this i would suggest destiny",9.0

"well, to start of, this is a free to play game, so you can expect that you have 2 ways to earn your things... you either pay or work hard for it. the gameplay itself its great, and sometimes very team based. i dont understand the push to talk system because, when your playing with a bunch of people its hard to tell who is talking.",73.5

"warframe is perfect for people that dont like pvp and just want to kill npc enemies and the way you play is your choice you could run into a room guns blazing or you could sneak in and take out half or more of the enemies without them knowing stealth is a big thing in this game i recomend that you try it you wont regret it",55.7

"most graphicaly detailed mmo ive ever seen. love the game play. having a sword and bow in space is a fun new spin. i found that the mouse sensitivety is more sensetive than a menstrating teenage girl who was just dumped on prom night, even after i turned it down almost to zero. this gives the illision of extreme lag which can piss you off. everything is also shaped weird, as in enemies and such. like there armor is plated over bursting tummours which have serverly deformed them, but this keeps the game interestin and fresh. runs pretty smoothly.",2.6
"dope game. good graphics, fast paced over the shoulder action ; only gripes are that there needs to be more enemy variety, as well as most of the missions feel....kind of the same? run through complex from point a to b style. luckily theres ninja parkour moves, which makes traversing the levels more enjoyable. both issues that i have about it can be fixed with (hopefully) future updates & patches. otherwise top-notch game.",31.3

"warframe a game where you never feel satisfied with where you are at an always wanna play more an more. at every turn of this game i felt intertwined with the world of warframe from the graphics to the amazing gameplay. its free to play an has a in game store which you need platinum for but if you find yourself playing for more than a year i believe you will buy some with real money. as the game stats in its title you play as warframes an you can craft every single one or you can buy them all but thatd cost you some hefty moola. it is very satisfying to make your warframe as you find yourself more inwraped in the game world as you make them. you feel accomplished after you spent the hours farming for the nessasary materials to make the things you need. an nearly everything in the game you can craft just cost credits which is what you can earn by just completing missions. from guns the swords this game hits the spot for action an if you like hack an slashing game or more gun approach then this game is for you. i found myself putting hours into this game an only wanna put more. ive made 4 warframes an bought 2 an i only wish to get more. they all add a different role to the game. if i did a review on this game id give it a 8/10!",181.4

"honestly an amazing game. once you get past the kinda crappy starter gear and into things you like more, it becomes really fun. the biggest pushfactor for most players is the crafting time. once you get over the fact that you cant always get what you want right away and learn to deal with it, it isnt an issue anymore. overall, a really fun, unique game. id reccomend it to anyone into any kind of action game.",747.9

"very entertaining co-op, and while still in beta, it delivers a very large amount of content. with the huge amount of customisation, both in appearances and functionality of frames and weapons, and even the ability to build something from the ground up, this game can keep you hooked for a long time. there are naturally, points in which it feels lacking for now, but digital extremes are obviously hard at work making this game better every moment they have. you can clearly see the amount of effort and love that are going into making this, and it seems that with every large update, the game just manages to become more aluring. there are quite a few approaches you can take on gameplay, especially concerning the weapons you choose. these can offer incredible diversity in playstyle, which one can further change according to their tastes, when it comes to customisation. the amount of mobility is also a great factor in this game, allowing you to perform a variety of acrobatic moves to get around, or even get the upper hand on enemies, if you know what youre doing.",652.2

"i do love this game a lot but be warned, the crafting of guns weapons suits etc, takes a very long time there is a lot in this game to be fair and it can be a lot of fun, i love it personally. yet the in game real world purchases of platinum is way over priced the lowest which is i think 3.99 only gets you 70 plat and the average price of a new warframe is between 250-300 plat and they go up to 375 plat so yeh i dont really wanna be paying all that money for one character that i can make but if you deal with having to wait a long time to earn new gear then this is definately a game you should download. also you can make your own clan dojo and build new rooms with research labs in and build decor around the rooms but this takes resources in game to do and myself and my clan mate have only recently got into this but it is a really nice touch to the game.",54.6

"pros... its a free game, amazing graphics, addictive gameplay, controller support, new content is added all the time, cons... since its a free game the micro transactions make the game a p2w(pay 2 win) since you can buy pretty much anything and if you dont decided to pay you have to grind and grind and grind to get the mats to build the items you want and after you killed all the bosses the game becomes a repetive grind for everything, the chat/invite system is to complicated but my main issue with this game is the lag problems it has, since the party host is the server host it depends on the connection they for you to have a playable experience other wise you have a 1-6 second delay on everything, you can shoot an enemy and see him die but the body will still be around cluttering the screen that means that you will have a massive amount of enemies just standing around blocking your attacks. i have a pretty decent connection(100mbps/100mbps) so i know its not my connection causing the issue and its seems that the only solution to this problem is to find people that have good connection and play with them, if the devs can fix this problem i can overlook all the other issues and actually enjoy the game.",204.7

"with smooth animation and semi-simple controls, warframe is on the right path. the graphics are pretty good, enough to run fluently. gameplay can be a little difficult, with no real levels to train. it pushes you right into the game, and does a good job of explaining the controls for the most part. some bugs may occur but its on its way. the sounds in the game are well done, an atmosphere that really pulls the player into the game. gameplay may be a little intense. all in all, warframe is a fairly good game, but it could use some improvements. 7/10",227.7

"i have played warframe alot and i can tell you that if you like shooters you will love this game. most free to play games i have played are really bad or are pay to win but warframe is not. warframe has a system were if you want to pay to get things quicker you can but almost everything that you can pay to get you can get without spending anything and the stuff you do have to pay for are mostly cometic. warframes combat system is very good and fun to play with becuase there is a weapon or tool for almost every play style out there. the people who make warframe seem to care very much about there game and what people think of it and have a content update every week and a big update every few weeks. one thing i wish warframe had more of is story and i think that that is pretty much the only thing that is lacking in warframe but do not worry because the devs are making meny updates to the story and lore. warframe is a very fun and very well made game and i think that if you like shooters you will love this game.",747.3

"awesome but should tell you more information and needs more story",370.5
"in all seriousness - this game is what destiny could have been if it actually made use of the money it charged people and had some balls. you have the entire solar system to explore. maps are randomly generated. enemies are interesting. missions are varied. dynamic events occur. and you have two tons of ranged weapons, melee weapons, mods, gear and so, so, so much more. if theres one criticism, is that the game can be harsh on newbies. not because its hard - its simply somewhat unwelcoming. a lot of things arent explained, and the game a bit too often hints that things can be purchased through the premium currency. dont be folled! almost everything can be bought with regular credits earned by playing or crafted through materials (also earned through playing). if you like the game, you should support it (i did), but at the start those platinum prices can be a bit disconcerting.",326.0
"although the bugs may be a turn off, i absolutely love this game. constant updates large and small keep the game more varied and interesting. the game alone may not seem to interesting but playing with friends is really fun. the warframes vary well having different support, offensive, and defensive abilities. also this is probably the best looking free to play around right now. overall if you have the room to download, give it a chance and play with friends and you will end up putting some hours into it.",226.3

"fun game, at times, farming is rough but other than that its pretty awesome.",102.7
"its a grinding game in essence with a somewhat bland storyline. much like a lot of mmorpgs or online free-to-play games. i personally enjoy playing it in moderation so that i dont tire of the grind and burn out. the developers are quite active and fix bugs from new patches consistently. new patches are released almost weekly with and major updates are monthly or bimonthly.",445.2

"great game, with a lot of fun to be had. youll have much more fun if you choose to play as part of a group, however. this is not a solo game by any means (even if you reach the point where you can overpower all content outside of the void), and leveling is much faster as part of a team. the game needs more difficult content, though. a well coordinated squad with strong weapons and frames trivializes all content currently in the game.",585.6

"warframe is a brilliant style, and in its unusualness, it creates nice and smooth gameplay. it is always bieng updated so it always feels new. the only propblem is sometimes when you go in a random group, people will refuse to help, but this does not happen to much once you reach the later levels.",5.7

"this game could be fun for those who would enjoy a good game with good mechanics and of course the online multiplayer aspect. as a gamer i enjoyed this game imensely too begin with! as a school student who works hard and studies after school i could not play this game everyday. and this is why i dont like this game: because it demands attention on a regular basis to grind for resources. i don not have the time while my friends do. along with the fact you need to pay for wepons slots (which my friends did) they poured hours off there life (over 500 hours) to get these elusive weapons that they refused to pay for. i can no longer play with them nor will i be able to catch up unless i pay money. these games suck because they require some money to have fun and can not be played by the caual gamer like me. if its your thing to spend all this time then enjoy but if you dont have the time to commit then dont bother.",57.9

"this game may be great, i wouldnt know because i uninstalled after the updates were installed and i saaw i had to have an online log-in just to check it out. i installed it because it said there was single player capability, and i have no desire for multiplayer at this time. it wasnt until i had already installed it that i learned that is is an open beta (not a big deal) and that i had to create an on line account and log in just to open the program (not what i was looking for). that probably doesnt matter to anyone else but me, so unless you just really dont want yet another on line account to deal with, go fo it.",1.0

"not many games i get addicted to, but with the constant updates it just keeps getting better and better!",986.3
"the game is repetitive in its level design and missions, but its constantly updated with new content. the biggest draw for me was the fluidity of the shooting, platforming, melee combat, using the powerups... it feels smooth and very fun. especialy when youre playing with a friend using a mic, then youll have tons of fun. additionaly the game is absolutely beautiful with its use of colour, its lighting and shadow effects, which is even more amazing considering it runs smooth on my low-spec pc.",23.6

[also if u get it i dont really reccomend a kubrow if ur not extremely dedicated cuz he will die if u dont care for him. pros: epic gameplay and u can play with ur friends as much as u want. cons: bad story, wait times for items and constant farming. its a fun game with addictive attributes and i do reccomend it if u like rapidly killing enemies with a bladegun] pros: epic gameplay and u can play with ur friends as much as u want. cons: bad story, wait times for items and constant farming. its a fun game with addictive attributes and i do reccomend it if u like rapidly killing enemies with a bladegun]warframe powers",101.5

"this game has dynamic movement controls allowing for fast paced game play or fast silent gameplay. the characters are adaptable to different play styles of first person shooter with a side arm, or swordplay. the third person view keeps you locked into the sci-fi setting by allowing you to see your warframe kick . it has the option to play solo, exclusively with friends, or online with a public lobby for each mission. drop-in games are usually successful and team work is commonplace. overall this game is a refreshing change to your first person shooter sci-fi action games. the storyline is interesting, and although i wont go into to detail, there could be more interaction. this is not an rpg, this is a mission oriented team play third person shooter. weapons are able to be modded for better efficiency, though it would be nice to see those mods change the physical appearance. a downside i have found is the difficulty to gain special currency for new warframes, and new gear. fantastic game, addictive as well - my husband now plays the game with me after only watching me play.",67.6
"i definately recommend this game to everyone, its absoluetly amazing! i just cant get enough of this game, ive only been playing it for about 6 days now and i have lots of time put into this game. for just a free to play game, this one is a lot of fun, and it has amazing graphics plus it runs really smooth. some people say that you have to buy platinum if you want decent stuff. but actually, the only time you have to use platinum, is when you want cosmetics (i.e. helmet, syandana, better colours, etc...), more warframe/weapon slots, or to purchase something right away. now, i would recommend using the 50 platinum they give you to start off with, to buy more slots, because the cosmetic stuff isnt really that important, where as slots are. basically everything else, you can get blueprints for, then go around to the different planets and missions to gather the materials to build them. some blueprints (warframes for example) require that you fight bosses more than once or go into the void so you can get things such as, the helmet, chassis, and systems. yes, this can take some time, but its worth it in the end. overall, i think this is a great game! the only negatives i could think of, is how some maps are used more than once, even though youre on a totally different planet, and the fact that you have to buy more colours with platinum. but, other than that, this game is great, and if you havent already, try it out! its free :d",64.5

"one of the only games that i can name that makes grinding fun and interesting. for the first week we were so addicted my friend actually flipped his internal sleep schedule by playing through the entire night too many times. hes in warframe rehab now. still worth it.",230.1
"in some cases to be pro you need real money, the game does not have framelimit some times when you turn camera around the fps drops, in some maps your fps is really unstable also there is a lot of bugs too and it made the game so unplayable. most of the missions looks like the same and the story is so boring, the game is just shoot and jump. i do not recommended this game if you want to play a f2p shooter.",14.3
"its a simple 3rd person shooter that feels like youre playing by yourself even when you arent. i got on and played a round alone and it was just lacking something, but it was alright. then i tried out the online game play and this is where i would take a few things into consideration before using up hard drive space. the idea of the game, after reading up is that every unit is individual and contributes to the larger team effort in a unique way. great concept! however it falls so flat that one might believe that it was tossed off the top of the empire state building. it turns into a run and outgun frag fest where all you end up doing if trying to get the most kills and score the most loot while leaving everyone else behind. the exp has nothing to do with team preformance or teamwork and instead only values the indiviual. thus turning what could be a great teamwork experience into super mario party with guns.",1.7
"its a very good game, but it turns into a grindfest very often. aside from that, i highly recommend it.",294.0

"youre a ninja. in space. with superpowers. best free game ive found - put 585 hrs into it at the time of this review and just now running out of things i want to do in the game. pros: excellent parkour system, nice weapons, highly customizable character/weapon loadouts, top-notch graphics. on one level its a pretty simple kill em all style fps, but on another level youll dig into the complex mechanics of damage types and modifying gear and combining players superpowers (abilities) to complete missions. the unique abilities for each character are pretty badass. many weapons have unique mechanics, too. you can solo most of the game if you choose, but id recommend joining a clan to make things easier when you do the missions that just cant be done solo, and there are many veterans like myself around to help out newer clan members. its free-to-play, but not pay-to-win. you can literally get everything in the game without spending real money due to the trading system, but that depends on your patience with farming. cons: ive played through a few major updates and have come to the conclusion that the developers are a highly talented team of visual artists who lack the skill to fix the persistent bugs and theres nobody in the company thatll speak up and say that an idea is akin to going full . they do listen to their community and ultimately fix most of their blunders though. the game involves a lot of farming/grinding which can get tedious.",909.5
"amazing game, its just so cool, great graphics, smooth gameplay. get this game.",33.4
"its just... bland. sure its fun at first, but it only took eight missions for me to be absolutely sure i did not like the game. even if i completely disregard the fact that pretty much 85% of the content is pay-to-use (big surprise, considering this is a free to play game), the remaining content you get is just not enough. and honestly, dont even try throwing the whole game is free, the developers need to make money somehow argument, because there are so many other games that can keep a good free-to-play backbone while offering premium content on the side. maybe there was an error somewhere in the game, but i entered a level 5-6 area hoping to do a mission whilst me myself being level 10, and the enemies absolutely steamrolled me, coming in groups of eight continuously. what really killed me though, after reviving five times, is the fact that after excrutiatingly overcoming impossible odds and coming within millimeters of completing this ridiculous mission, i ran out... need more revives? they cost real money to buy... and youll need them in some of these poorly designed levels... and boy, the money to content ratio in this game is laughably poor. i looked at the $100 pack that steam offers, and boy have i not laughed that hard in a long time...",7.0
"warframe, an amazing third person game which would be pretty accurate to say is the epitome of robot ninjas, which in turn, makes this game extremely fun to play. besides the repetition of levels and the occasional glitches, this game has everything pretty much down pat, from awesome graphics to a solid fighting system which makes this game even better to play, and its all for free!! so i highly recommend adding this game to your library, and you will get quite a few hours of entertaining moments out of it.",201.5
"this game is extremely well thought out, has amazing graphics, actually did the over the shoulder thing right, and is absolutely free! it even comes with a little bit of the real life currency. just make sure you turn motion blur off and if it lags turn off shadows. they do reuse some areas, but its a damn cool game.",6.2

"how to start... well, warframe is an action/fps/hack n slash game so addictive at the beginning, you will be surprised of the amazing and funny gameplay and method to obtain the stuff, its easy, its attractive, its fast, its cooperative, etc, you will be interested in being more powerfull with better mods/weapons/warframes, etc, later you will have a feel that its a bit repetitive the gameplay, then the absence of a decent vs multiplayer mode (like; capture the flag, deathmatch, control points, king of the hill, etc) will make you feel a void in your soul, then you will feel a lil disappointed when you realize wf in some cases is too p2w, and etc etc... afterall, seeing that wf is still on develop, you will say that is not that bad, when you have your mates there; its an amazing game to play and always it will make you go deep on it and having you playing more and more, obtaining what you want to obtain because its true, you can obtain the 90% of the stuff without pay (certainly, slots system is a bit abusive) and with all of this in mind you will say ok, lets try again to see if the boss finally drop the blueprint? :) and you will repeat this again and again... 9/10",838.0

"two reasons why to play: 1. its free, why the hell not? 2. youre a god damn alien robot ninja thing that can do backflips. i would say warframe is an excellent game which requires you to spend some time to actually get good at. though the key mapping is very odd, after a while you get used to it. i did encounter quite a few bugs though, one of the worst, being in first person (i dont know how it happened, dont ask). though playing in first person may seem cool and all, it made me feel nautious as hell and i couldnt even see what i was doing.",158.3

"i left this game for some months and came back to feel the awesomeness again, started over with a new account, and i had a lot of fun seeing all of these new changes like the cutscenes and the badass intro, the dynamic weapon selection that allows you to choose unlike before, and the characters look very cool and have a lot of unique abilities.",149.9
"while this game is fun and action packed, it can get extremely repetative and pointless. the game is fun to play with friends, but it can be absolutely mind-numbing to play by yourself. pros -great graphics and lots of shiny environments -action packed -the different warframes have a few unique elements that make for some fun gameplay -in theory, you can build the warframes (the ones you would usually have to buy) cons -game is super grindy -environments, while pretty, become stale after a while. you are basically in the same 4 or 5 different environments with slightly different layouts -the system to level up cards to gain powers is interesting, but again the grind... -little to non-existant story -certain warframes are completely unbalanced (namely the ones you have to buy) -most things worth building take forever to create this was a fun game, but at the end of the day i cant recommend it. theres way too much grind and not enough going on behind the scenes. this is a fun little coop game to play with your friends, but youll quickly start to feel the repetition as you reach the 10-15 hour mark. there are some games that are super grindy but hide it well behind interesting gameplay, a good story, or a variety of builds to work towards. this game is not one of them.",56.3

"hey linux gamer, do bother to try and get this game to on your os! its worth it! ive played it on the ps4, loved it, now im playing it on pc. however, i would really hope that de ports this game to linux, since you willencounter some graphical glitches that can ruin the gameplay experience pros: + mission variety, and it keeps it from getting too repetitive. + instead of bunny hopping like in quake, you copter your way through the level (movement exploit). very fast paced! + farming is somewhat managable if you know what your doing (refer to their wikia) minor nuancees: - still not for linux! - pvp is somewhat broken as of v16 (because youll be facing some high level primed warframes with their higher tier guns). - 3rd person camera issues in tight areas no tux, no bux. im not throwing my money at de just yet.",47.1

"the game wows you with cool visuals and super slick space ninja action, but the novelty quickly wears off as the freemium model rears its ugly head. low weapon and warframe slots nearly guarantee youll need to spend money on it, and grinding for worthless weapons as well as ranking them up just to increase your mastery rank is the only thing to do mid to late game. not to mention poorly thought out events and horrible buggy messes of maps.",639.1

"this game is amazing in some respects. it has a depth that you rarely see in a hack and slash / shooter and the gunplay is unique in its own right. the monetization is also very fair. that said the game after long enough starts to fade into repetition, bosses are recycled, levels seem hard to diffrientiate from one another and so forth. my main issue though with this game is that the possibility to extend playtime is there. in fact the levels are already built but the game cordens them off until you unlock a certain type of 1 use key.",52.9

"this is a great game, i fell in love with it on the ps4, but its really something you need to spend some time in and maybe a trip to the wiki or the forum to really see its potential. if youre cool with shooting a lot of basic enemies and occasionally some badass ones, youll be fine here. honestly, when youre traversing half the area in a spin attack and slicing through infected like a space ninja blender, youll appreciate this game.",2.3
"this game is one of the best games ive ever played. sure the story line isnt very good because its more focused on the gameplay mechanics, but holy hell is it fun. there are a lot of different weapons to choose from and the best thing is you actually earn them and dont just run around, get a bunch of money, then buy them like in other games. this game is not for people who just wanna be able to get the good stuff fast without spending real money, i highly reccomend this for people who want a game their gonna play for awhile before they earn all the stuff because ive played this game for 100+ hours and ive only had a few of the many weapons and characters in the game.",289.3
"do not payattention to the metacritc sorce becuase this game is one of the best free to play games of all time. to make things easier when you first start to game the games goes unto its oone seperate luancher which downloads all of the updates. some people find that the updating process is annoying but after that this game gets very fun. also you should know that this game does not operate on pay to play you can build wepons and new warframes you dont have to buy them, i repeat you dont have buy new wepons and warframes. take your time, be patent and dont buy new stuff and you will love this game. if you have a question just look up a guide on steam or google. thanks",223.6

"what always impressed me with this game was how the launch trailer animation is... well... just slightly dramatised gameplay. its literally what the game is, everything the ninjas do in it are actions you can do in the game (albeit animated slightly better), its not some ot korean mmo intro. its super ethical advertisement and i love it. overall its a good game and i suggest it. its free anyway so you lose nothing trying.",162.7
"one of the best games i played in a while. add me if your going to play it :cookiejump. its either pay to win or work ur  off to win haha. u have to harvest specific resources to be able to build weapons , warframes , sentinels and many more things. its a great ninja space shooter. sometimes it feels like mass effect , which made me like the game even more. its a great game . *best to play with friends.",71.6

"its quite repetitive, however the amount of work being done to the game constantly is what makes it so refreshing. since i started i have seen overhauls and great work being done to gameplay and mechanics. its a great game, but it is slightly grindy. also, if you get a dog and arent able to log in for some time, the dog dies.",158.8
"grindy and repetitive. huge content curve from beginner introductory levels to when you get to the planets you actually need to farm for weapons and characters (known as warframes). the 3 intro characters arent that interesting, the most interesting characters will take you hours upon hours to farm materials for and literal days to research and build them in-game (game uses real time for crafting) and the pay2win gate to skip all of this incredibly expensive, unfortunately there is probably a half-decent experience past the ridiculous initial curve but it just wasnt interesting enough on its own to warrant my time. if you enjoy grinding and repetitive shooting or just grinding in general, i would recommend this. otherwise, stay away. (note how all the positive reviews are people with 300+ hours played)",5.6

"a free-to-play game worth all the time and effort. a variety of items to use, to build, to get,... you can never tire from its gameplay. ever expanding, only time will tell when it will stop. worth all the money too if you were to spend on the in-game items.",442.0
"i feel like this falls under the category of overhyped; i got bored with the combat and mission grinding not even 4 hours into the game. i mean, dont get me wrong; the concept is great. i love the whole idea of this game. ive seen the classes in action and i love it all. but its once again, one of those games where you can just dump your money all over it and already have everything in the damn game. you get a small selection of classes at the start of your playthrough, and youll quickly want to try out the new classes. however, getting the materials necessary for getting another class in the game requires a massive amount of work and time; i had to buy a blueprint for a blueprint so i could make the blueprint just for another frickin class to play! then getting the right material to make this one blueprint required fighting a boss that spawned on one world, and it had like a 3% chance of dropping. then crafting the actual crap together would literally take days in real time. whereas i couldve just dropped about a hundred bucks and already have that class and a load of weapons/items for it in no time at all! a shameless cash grab! i literally got into a game where two other players who already had everything rushed through a mission in less than two minutes and killed everything in the level with the  they just bought. really now? some open beta this game is. dont waste your time on this crap.",8.8

"pros.warframe is a very very good game it`s better than most $59.99 games it`s not pay to win like a most free to play games you can get every warframe/character though in game resources and you can get most costimization items without paying a thing, i`ve played 300hours without spending a pennie and had fun doing so.and while graphics aren`t every thing warframe has very good graphics for a free to play game. new content is constantly being made adding new modes,mods,warframes,weapons,game elements such as sindicits,quest,companions,and etc.also warframes or characters aren`t more powerful than others just different. cons. while i do so dearly love warframe its not a perfect game there are bugs that accor every now then mostly after major updates, sometime forgring times can be a bit agervating,pvp can sometimes seem glued on, and there can be overly long grinds at points.but in the end i strongly recommend warframe to those who enjoy fastpace co-op pve third person shooters/sworders.",440.0

"an interesting game, in many ways. one that must be played in a party or all sense of cohesion is lost. it can be fun but team play may well be non existant and the wall running is ropey. i have enjoyed my brief time with it but it is most definitely pay to win, ignore the taf that says otherwise. at least it isnt pvp, that business model would kill the game very quickly otherwise.",3.9
"i love this game, i will be honest the constant need for platinum is irritating (if you want to good stuff without the long grind) but the gameplay is smooth, the weapons can be amazing when modded to your liking, and the maps are beautifully done. i cant recommend this enough, not everyone likes it but hell - i love it.",1084.2
"i have played longer and im in master lvl 10 but my steam profile says that i have only played like 81 hours. i recommend warframe but it has two problems, 1. breaking the noob barier, meaning that the first 4 mastery lvls are the hardest and kinda the most boring ones, however once youre through that and have some good stuff itll be a blast. 2. paying users and non-paying users: if you pay nothing your warframe and stuff will never look that good and itll ruin the expirence for you, meanwhile your teammates (paying users) will have special armour and well coustumized colours and skins. with the armours, colours and skins and stuff youll enjoy playing the game much more. but overall its a good game and you can get stuff at events and more and you can also sell stuff on trading and meaby buy some stuff for the money you make there. :) im very sorry if i made any spelling mistakes.",121.6
"warframe while not being the best f2p games i have played is defiantly one of the better ones. while it is true that you spend alot of time grinding, and that the silver(ingame currency paid with real money) is oddly expensive those do not take away the fun of the game.",49.0

"warframe is set in a universe where the solar system is locked in unending conflict between the tenno, the corpus, and the grineer, while the infestation threat looms over all three. you can carry out a number of different mission types to collect materials, credits, blueprints, and simply prove your skills while culling the unending threat. warframe is a game about farming at its core. you collect materials to make more weapons, warframes, and companions, eventually switching to new ones while customizing abilities and stats to suit your play-style. and while the game is in essence about farming, the combat, power, and movement systems allow one to create a very entertaining spectacle of flashing steel and lead. run on a wall, jump off, spin like a helicopter, and decapitate a grineer soldier, then top off the display by landing into a graceful slide followed immediately by another instantaneous guillotine slash from your weapon. learning to carry out movement combinations and power uses all while using firearms and blades of all sort is what makes this game really enjoyable. but, you might eventually get tired of the farming and look for a different experience.",523.2
"pretty cool co-op game, very simular to mass effect",9.9
"this game is damn good fun. been playing since it went into beta, and it was pretty full of bugs back then. the devs have been really constantly hard at work, the game feels much less buggy now and the content generation rate is extremely impressive. theyre also super responsive and communicative with the community, which is a huge plus. however, it does suffer from the same issue as tf2 in that it has way more melees than it needs, but thats not so bad. the game is a ton of mindless fun, you just get to shoot a bunch of bad guys with a huge arsenal of weaponry, and the co-op aspect is pretty cool, especially with friends. plus, its free (albeit with a premium currency that has a really expensive model...). the main crippling factor of the game right now is that it has no late game; after youve explored the whole star chart and done the void missions there really isnt too much to do right now. fortunately, the devs are working on that so well wait and see.",781.4
"i have been playing for 2 weeks now and so far have 216 hours in, i cant stop playing this game. it is a fast paced 3rd person shooter with decent graphics and great gameplay. the movements can awkward at times and the melee feels a bit sluggish but other than that i have no complaints. you build and research your own weapons from materials and blueprints you find through out your journey. you can also build sentinals, new warframes, equipment or take on a master challenge like me of building your own dojo. the game has a great and helpful player base that is seemingly always willing to answer questions to the best of their capacity. it has a pay to save time system rather than pay to win, in other words if u can buy it, you can farm it. it should be noted however that the best items are earned and can not be purchased. this game has tons of content to always offer you a new challenge and hours fun gameplay while you grind out and learn new tricks to survive. i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters and grinding/farming games. if you decide to give it a play im always looking for new friends to run with so send me a msg, gamertag dreoyast.",370.7
"fast paced, high flying robot ninja action! this game is extremely fun!",228.9
"loved this game. it is fast. easy to learn. shame it is not available for mac.",21.6
"for a free to play game, warframe certainly gets quite a few things right: the graphics are gorgeous, the game mechanics are simple, & the frames (characters) are unique, and stand out with personalities even though they dont have dialouge. as a bonus, the developers are very involved in the community; adding new weapons and items, as well as implementing new game modes and events with detailed backgrounds on a regular basis. the weapons and frames are so diverse and numerous, & its really fun to experiment and find a combination that you call your own. the only problem i have with the games structure is that you get very few weapon and frame slots to start with, and you can only get more through buying platinum (cash). there are so many weapons and frames i feel that they need to add a few more slots, because new players might not have the information they need to sink some money into the game if they cant experiment with more than 2 frames or 4 weapons. and, unfortunately, the starting weapons suck to the maximum, but that should be expected since you need to work your way up. i would definitely reccommend this game to anyone who wants an action / brawler game, because the melee / ninja-acrobatic side is stronger than the shooter side.",1147.5
"this is a good game, futuristic setting and uses online co-op. the graphics are cool and the general feel is awesome. its free but you need to register by email so i reccomend this strongly. the dlcs are basically for lazy people who cant get good without them or want to get good quick. its like tf2 if ur sh!t it doesnt matter what ur accounts worth!",6.2

"overall, warframe is pretty cool. you get swords, guns, swords and guns, etc, and get to destroy tons of enemies with them. the damage system is really deep, with different types all affected by the different mods you apply to your weapons. one thing is that everything is very expensive, so you will have to grind a lot of resources, but re-playing levels endlessly isnt so bad when you do it with an awesome crew of friends.",14.6
"decent game. i really enjoy it, but dont be fooled by the free to play. it is definately a free to play, but to get any sort of decent upgrades you have to pay for it. if youre looking for a third person shooter to play with your friends for a while this might be it.",5.0
"you ninja things and sometimes win sometimes lose but you lose less when you win and get better and less scrubby, and crafting takes a long  time unless you pay monnies you rich person what do you think because you have money youre better than other space zombie ninjas? jerk. this has been a professional review by me. final review score; 9/10 i guess this game is okay.",811.6
"where to start with this one... well first off, i like the ghrapics, the gameplay, and the abilities. however, after a couple hours of playing, i noticed that the enemies started doing way more damage, and i was doing roughly the same as i started out. so i decided to look for a new stronger weapon. i find out, that you cant buy a weapon thats better using the in game credits. oh no. you have to buy the currency using real money, in order to get a decent weapon. its that, or you can do the facebook style of upgrading, buy the blue print, play a level a half dozen times to find a resource, and then hopefully after a day of grinding you have what you need. did i mention, the fact you cant kill the enemies even on the first level anymore, because their difficulty progressed with you? >.>... so good luck getting those resources! yet another potentially great game, turned to  from greed. i would have much rather paid 50-60 bucks for the game, and the ability to progress with ingame credits that i didnt have to buy, versus having to buy 20 dollars worth of game money, for a single weapon. really. as for those of you who fell victim to that, and want to hold onto that pride so to speak, of this being a great game, it is, sure, but only for about 45 minutes.",6.2

"the game at the beginning is very slow paced and confusing. their mod system is not explained and their introduction is sort of bad. the lack of story makes the game not as compelling early on however if you do some research and stick with the game for the long run you will find it very rewarding. the gameplay and mod system and the different warframes/guns are just so fun. i have farmed every single prime weapon (the exclusive version of weapons that can only be obtained through grinding). try it out and youll find that you like it",1312.6
"a great 3rd person ninja simulator. a diverse range of weapons and abilities. only problem is it acts much like an ipad or iphone game in the aspect of pay platinum to rush build this!, however, the addition of trading lessens that to an extent.",248.4

"to be honest warframe is a good game with potential but de are making too many mistakes. yea its a game where you can slice and guy then u burn him then u watch him fall to the ground but there is only so far that ccan get you. once you get into the game the game get repetitive. although i personally dont mind but at times farming items can get annoying. in conclusion this willl be a great game some day but for now it needs more input from the community.",537.8

"love this game. so many options! male and female warframes, weapons, accessories, and companions, and so much more. i love how you can customize just about everything color-wise, if you can buy the color pallettes. my only hang up is that platinum (the currency you can pay actual cash for.) is pretty expensive. but you can wait and see if you get a discount on it in your daily bonus, or you can trade prime parts for it, so it isnt too big a deal, just takes longer that way. its pretty amazing to play with other people and friends as well, jokes galore and you can mess with your friends. theres also some funny glitches that happen... like falling out of the map, getting stuck in walls and things and so on. the glitches dont happen often though and it only happens usually when the player is doing something they probably shouldnt do... like run at a wall full speed or jump up the elevator shaft while its moving and go through the ceiling. good game. 10/10",245.5

"its a 3rd person action/shooter with a fair emphasis on the grind. a lot of ppl will be put off by the rng nature of some of the items that you have to farm but at the same time if you go into this with a few friends the game can be extremely fun. keep in mind im also a huge fan of monster hunter so my opinion is a tad bias in that regards. the cash shop isnt game breaking and it gives ppl without a lot of time on their hands a chance to keep up with those that play this game too much. all in all if you enjoy 3rd person action games i would recommend that you look into this one, just keep in mind that to get to a lot of the end game stuff youre either going to pay for it or invest a fair amt of time into it.",1184.5

"though it does have potential and looks good, the graphics first off, when you turn your camera, or rotate, the screen goes insane and has like what look to be really long sideways water drips going across the screen, or movement streaks, which make sit almost impossible to see, also, you move so fast, in the beginning where it teaches you how to do things, you cant get your cursor over the enemies, making it close to impossible to shoot them. the game, lags a bit, not that much, the game has no options to turn off sensitivitey, also it is not much of one, but a bit of ptw game (pay to win). if you can see that i am the only one not recommending it, here is why, they all talking about after you get into the game pretty far, and after you get into it, and get deeper and play more of the game. at the beginning of the game, it is very difficult to proceed.",1.0
"its a beta, but as of u14 i cant stand the interface, it feels confined to a single menu, and thats the game.. i liked pre update 14, but i cant argue some of the things they added were phenominally great.",398.3
"ok, pros: fast paced shooting mechanics, decent sword mechanics. good mobility, customization not that good but workable. teamwork, can still play solo however. and a stealth and free-run mechanic. nvidia graphics and physics! cons: you will never get into pvp becuase of your inventory ### doesnt meet the requirements. unfair, if not almost cheating ai. cash store always dangled in front of your face. when the game adds a new playable warframe, it feels like you must pay. in order to play it. feels unrewarding. buggy beyond beleif, but thats because its an mmo. near impossible to join a guild/clan. notorius time waster. lotus voice. overall: i enjoyed this game for a few days, but between drm, lack of commmunication with other players, and cash store ads. i reached my pain; enjoyment thresh hold. it just seems like a time waster, and you never feel like you accomplish anything, unless you sink in $$$ of course. if you need to waste a few hours go ahead, but it just felt to as if there was no point to doing all of the same repeating missions over and over again. its up to you.",15.2

"is good to entertain, very long gameplay (really no ending) and after each update it gets better is a on-going ride, a free ride and that is all what matter.",130.5
"my opinion of warframe is biased towards how i find enjoyment (i like grinding in games, no matter how trivial or boring). the gameplay is enjoyable, fun to parkour though there wasnt many places that used it until update 9. the weapons and warframes themselves are quite varied, although serious investment is needed to get the top tier equipment. as of now, the game is still in beta but despite the bugs its a highly decent free to play game. nearly everything in the game you can aquire without any payment, it just takes time. so how much youre willing to spend is how much time you save with the game. you do need a lot of time though, some drops are very low and get lower if youre a collecter of items like me. overall; if you have a lot of time, this is a great game to spend it, especially with friends. if you want to have some money free, you can wait for a log-in reward of a platinum discount (ingame premium currency) and buy some gear. otherwise, if you just want to have fun for a while with little investment, start as an excaliber and slash dash your way to victory one grineer squad at a time.",620.2
"pretty good third person shooting free to play game to hand out with friend but the fun wareoff pretty quick if you playing solo",600.2
"i love this game becuase it has everything i enjoy from a game. it has a way to do a very stealthy run through, or just take a blade and gun and run through everybody like they are nothing. plus the fact that it was free is why i cant stop playing this game. i only have complaint. i have a mac laptop now and one of the first things i planned to do was download steam and get warframe. here is where my complaint comes in. i had spent my time playing this great game so when i got this better computer, i planned on keep playing... but i cant because it isnt available for apple computers. i dont know if this is because the game is so high quality that it cant run on this system, but i am hoping that is not the case. if there was any possible way that the game devs could make this gem of a game run and play well on a mac. i would download it and play it immedietly.",14.0
"this game is very good so far. you can choose from multiple character builds, or tennos and you can customize them and play with cooperatively with others. just like most free to play games, you can get what you want much faster if you buy it with real money. there are still ways to get what you want though, it just take more time to get them. overall though this is a very good game, and its free.",23.5
"amazing game, however my friend started around the same time as me but he does not like it. i guess it is a hate it or love it type of game. p.s dont expect this too be a quick game. if you want to be good it take really long. i have played 30+ hours and still have one of the starting tenno. (almost have rhino:) you will have to play alot if you want this game too be awesome and believe me it is worth it,",66.1

"warframe has a some really good things, but it also has a lot of bad things. it has really interesting things and really boring ones too. since it is free to play, give it a try and see for yourself. as for me i love the art direction, the lore and the level design. i hate the grind and its depth in gameplay.",580.4

"warframe is a new generation of shooters where you dont take in the aspect of first person. instead you take on the third person point of view which can be very different from games like call of duty, battlefield, and all of the other top games out there.being in the third person gives you a lot more awareness and ability/control over your character. you may have to use more strategy then your normal games you may or may not play, but once you learn it will be a lot of fun for you and your friends.",155.8
"this is a really fun shooter. at the moment it is completely free, sure if you want some color customizations you need platinum (the cashable currencey) but that platinum can be farmed by selling mods or blueprints. anyway, the game is nice and well paced. the controls need a bit getting used to but otherwise its a borderlands-halo mashup with some extra mobility and less humor. the different warframes give you various playstyles. from tank to ninja everything is in there. if you like good shooters with lots of different weapons and mods and you dont mind serious grinding, then youll enjoy this. if youre not a big fan of grinding you probably wont like this game unless you want to invest real money, since your base weapons arent all that great, like in any game youve played you have to put some effort in it to get the good stuff. if you have to break it up into pros and cons it would probably look a bit like this; pros: - good shooter - large variety of modifications for warframe and weapon - multiple playstyles possible - free to play design well made - nice graphics cons: - controls need getting used to neutral - grind heavy - fast paced to sum it up short its pretty much space ninja grinding asap.",888.4

"i have searched for a good combat mmo game aside from the popular console call of duty/halo ect. for a long time. and i have finaly found one. stratagy, combat skills, construction, critical thinking, lore, all in one game. the devs are always coming up with ways to add to the game or expand the games lore universe/gameplay, so the game is always evolving. the user base is for the most part supportive and friendly, and unlike most games i have tried, the elitist jerk few cant set up roadblocks to the common player base and make thier gameplay miserable and unfruitful. a word of warning, becasue the game is always evolving it is natural that bugs come with that territory. players affectionatly call it bugframe or crashframe becasue of it, but in my opinion the rewarding gameplay is worth it. a word on its free 2 play status as there is much critizism especailly after 15.0 update. although there are some limitations at trying to running it f2p, it can be done. game currency can be earned thru the player trading system, game currency only items can be earned in the game although takes more time/in less quantity, and certain items can be traded for things you want but cant get. if you do decide to put some money in the game, a little goes a long way, and there is discount coupons all the time.",928.9
"although i do recommend this game the replay is not very high. very repetitive, if you play online everyone just rushes through levels at super high speeds, best played solo if you want a challenge. lots of mods and warframes so the customization is there. if you do spend money on this game use it to buy weapon and warframe slots because what they give you doesnt allow you to stockpile much.",90.5

"this is an exciting, fast paced, third-person, game that will keep your hairs standing high! it involves gymnastic kills and (such as jumping high into the air and then slamming down into the ground at your enemy) quick kills. (such as charging at the target, which stuns them then slice or shoot them to their inevitable death.) its great because it gives long-ranged, and close-ranged players a exciting action packed game. i highly suggest downloading and installing it if you like third-person ninja fighting with guns! and bows! and so much more! (it states your a ninja and you really are like you can wall run and sprint really fast and jump high but you dont know any actual martial arts.)",6.7
"fantastic game, especially seeing as its free. however, if you want the best stuff, you have to pay for it - and its not too cheap. if you really enjoy the game though, its definitely worth putting in a little bit, after all, they need the money. my main problem with it is that it just loves to crash; especially when you get a message on skype or steam or anything along those lines. overall, a bit faulty but well worth it.",20.6

"well. 371.2hrs on this game isnt much for those warframe pros. i recommend this game who loves to play farming games. farm farm exp farm every single thing to get those that looks really cool. but after so much time spent. waiting for foundries... i decided to stop... just... cant... stand it anymore. lots of new warframe shells are coming. and there are only 2 slots given by the game. need to buy with real money or sell stuff...well...uh... yeah. pretty much it. recommended... i have no life after playing this game",371.2
"ive been playing this game a lot over the past 4 months, so far im really impressed. great graphics. smooth gameplay. action packed levels, easy learning curve, tons of weapons. new content gets added on a regular basis and patching is quick and problem free. dozens of game modes. in-game clans even get a sci-fi customizable/expandable base. craft new weapons and armor out of materials and blueprints found while blasting and slashing your way through intense hoards of aliens, infected, space marines, or other awesome things. not just any weapons and armor, but awesome sci-fi-ninja- medieval-laser-explosion-missle bow and arrow-jet hammer-living plasma rifle-gravity and time-space bending weapons and armor. etc. there is no end to the new weapons and stuff i can make and, suprise!, every time its something cool and ridiculous. thumbs up.",164.1

"overall this is a nice game to play whenever you have free time however the game itself is extremely tedious and occasionlly boring whenever you try to play alone. if you do want to pick this game up i advise that you play with a friend so that it will be more entertaining. otherwise here are the games pros and cons. pros: -nice diversity in characters & weapons to choose from and use - graphics are nice to look at (especially at max settings) - blood and gore is always a plus - can use in-game currency to buy warframes(characters) and weapons - you never feel like the game is pay to win cons: - in order to obtain new warframes and weapons in-game without buying them you have to buy the blueprints, obtain all of the materials to craft said item via the games crafting system and crafting times are fairly long ranging anywhere from 12-70 hours in real time also you have to do all of this with in-game currency. - level designs are incredibly repetative as you will see the same level designs several times over the course of your playthrough. - two leveling systems profile leveling/character&weapon leveling. yes in order for your weapons and characters to be at max power you have to level them up first also leveling your profile takes a huge amount of time. - certain weapons are level locked so in order to craft or even buy them you first have to level up your profile to the required level. - game can feel like a huge grind especially when playing alone.",408.9

"so when i first started playing this, i really wasnt that into it. then a couple of months passed, and i started to slowly get more and more into it. your experience in this game really starts to become more enjoyable the more and more you play. because for someone who only played for like an hour a week at the start, given my old meh review, i now put plenty of hours into this. at this point, it has become my most played game on steam and im not afraid to admit it.",424.1

"you need a pretty good computer to run this game smoothly",2.4
"this game is pretty kubrow. seriously though. every kind of weapon you can think of from the past or future. an amazing variety of characters (frames) to suit any play style and each one can be customized to suit you even further. the style is very unique and i love it. go thousands of years in the future, and place ancient samurai-like warriors on a backdrop of chaos, genocide, and a very mysterious history. sure, it can get repetitive and is somewhat centered around grinding and farming, but if youre a fan of shooting, slashing, and appreciating art, this is the game for you. plus the community is great. i dont know if ive wasted too many hours of my life in the ferocious battleground of pvp forums and region channels, or if warframes pve atmosphere is just special, but it is extremely refreshing to consistently run across players that want to help and work together. the dev team, too, is excellent at pushing new content and listening in on feedback from the players. oh, its free. theres no reason not to grab some friends and give it a shot.",829.2

"i am normally skeptical about f2ps. they tend to deliberately misinform or inflate their attributes in order to rob people of their cash bit by bit. well, let me tell you that the big difference between warframe and all the rest (perhaps, excluding dota), is that it doesnt hurt to give digital extremes money: the game is actually good. first, it has the production values of a aaa title. that being said, it looks and sounds beautifully, while having randomly generated levels and a incredibly robust leveling and upgrading system that has nothing to envy to most rpgs. everything in the game is craftable one way or another, and the things that are not are, either cosmetic, or stupid cheap. the grind is present, but almost unnoticeable if youre savvy about where you farm. also, the sheer variety of warframes means its guaranteed youll find a frame that suits your style. like stealth? play ash. like hard hitting? try rhino. like to blow everyone apart? give nova a whirl. everything is there to be crafted, no strings attached. a fantastic game to play with friends or alone.",550.9

"with a great player driven economy, and the ability to earn all non-cosmetic items in the game, digital extremes has hit a great point with players all over with warframe. while many would say that the premium currency (platinum) is highly overcosted, they regularly give out coupons for their daily login prizes, ranging from 20% all the way to 75% off the regular price, and said platinum can also be earned in game by completing certain missions and earning parts and mods that the player can sell to others for the currency. the gameplay can get tedious, seeming as how most of the missions are cookie-cutter. but if you can get past the grinding, and the repetition, warframe might just become one of your favorite free-to-play gems in your library",129.8

"if youre looking for a good free to play game. then look give this a try. the game is fun and fast pace, yeah you do the same thing over and over but doesnt mean its going to be easy like the last. with a tone of warframes to choose from that may fit you best. this game isnt connected to the steam friends list. so you have to find your friends in the game (by asking them what their name is in warframe). i doubt this helped (or is even a review) but i really do think people should at least give this a go. also power levels are bull sh*t.",145.7
"this game is good for the first 200 hours or so then it gets boring but every update brings something new so you play it again so i rate this game a 8.5/10 good game not enough varity to keep me playing though also lots of bugs",264.2

"an extremely addicting game to jump into at first. it makes you feel like a badass ninja who can jump around and well, be awesome. the thing i have against it is that it takes a long time to actually get decent weapons and swords to fight with. and at first you really feel jealous of how other people who have much more amazing stuff and who are more powerful are way better than you. its pretty much just grinding and showing off. theres a few glitches here and there but you must keep in mind that the game is in beta. it has great potential and at the moment is amazing. overall great game.",205.4

"quite possibly one the greatest free-to-play games on the market, the community is decent, the graphics are dazzling, and the combat is explosive, however this game loses its appeal once the equipment and character acquisition grind come into play. all characters and weapons are craftable, however pay-to-win is a very viable option unfortunately, with crafting times varying from 1 day to 3 days for each piece, let alone the actual multiple piece item. the environments are recycled and lose their shine after a while, though it really doesnt detract from the game seeing as how it fits the clone/pirate/zombie storyline. overall a superb game, until you hit the equipment wall.",87.8

"dont be fooled by the disgraceful reviews of the big reviewers like ign and gamestop or whatever, but this game is amazing, especially for free to play. you feel in control and can chop your enemies down using some skills you obtain, you can change colours of your character, get new skills and mods for your weapons, helmets etc. now dont get me wrong, these things come at a price, quite a large price too, i totally recommend this game, its fun and can have a blast with friends. to be honest, i would rate this game a 8 out of 10 for some flaws, but i am disgusted of how the big reviewers have rated this game, so i just want to back it up a bit.",0.6

"like ninjas with guns? well this is ninjas with guns in space! the game is based entirely on how overpowered you can get, whether you augment your warframe, modify and max out your weapons, or go ballistic with your melee of choice. gameplay is varying on how you wish to play and there are dozens of warframes for them. however, its good to keep in mind that you may find yourself doing a lot of grinding and looting for the rarer materials to build said warframes. maps can get repetitive, but helps you remember where loot can be found. you either have to go through a lot of grinding to get materials and credits to forge new gear, with can get boring when playing alone. biggest issue, though, is the drastic difficulty curve. one moment, youre dominating every grineer, corpus, and infested you come across. next thing you know, youre flattened by the next planets enemies. id recommend this game, but definitely if you have someone to play with. relying on matchmaking usually ends up with total strangers much stronger than you, noobs who dont know what to do so you constantly have to revive them, or soloing witht the chance of losing all your revives. basically, i recommend you make some friends or meet your ends.",415.9

"so here is the deal. warframe is aweful. honestly 0/10 would not play. maybe... maybe 2/10 cuz swords. other than that this game is lame. you force yourself to play a few hours, however, becuase it has gotten higher ratings than some of your favorite games. so youre in around ten hours, and you get to your first level 30 weapon. you have since then purchased and/or found other weapon parts and intended to build a superior weapon to the weapon you currently have. you give it a shot and holy dear lord is it good. and it felt pretty satisfying coming out of the 12 or 24 hour oven (foundry). so you play with that for a while and have a decent amount of fun. so okay, games not great, maybe a 5/10. at least its free. but, becuase this new weapon is pretty good, you want to see what else is on the horizon. rinse and repeat until about 40 hours when you realize that youve covered most of the starchart and have a few good weapons. rinse and repeat until you can take down anything in the starchart very fast. rinse and repeat until you can take out the stalkler in one hit with a meelee weapon. rinse and repeat until you can last to 45 mins + on t4 survival. etc., etc., ,etc. 10/10 god tier game. would recommend (even dropping cash on teh game) tl;dr graph of y = x where x is how much you play and y is your desire to play",271.4

"this game has come such a long way since release. now i cant stop playing it. everything in the game can be unlocked as long as you put some time into it, so even if there are a lot of purchasable items and equipment, you can still be on par with those players. the combat is extremely fluid, physics are wonderful, graphics are fu**ing amazing, and the diversity in the frames and weapon builds make it fun to show off to your friends.",163.4

"warframe is by far the best free-to-play shooter ive seen, theres no pay to win as there is no real player versus player (besides the deuling mode in the clan bases, edit: and conclave, but nobody plays that anyway heuehuhehehhhe.) and while grinding for credits and parts to build stuff can get a little tedious, all the levels are procedurally generated so they always keep you on edge as what to expect. grab 3 friends to play this game with you, and give it a try on whatever platform you feel.(*cough*pcmasterrace*cough*)",99.5
"i recommend this game because it is absolutly amazing and i can tell what ill be spend hours playing after i finish a school assignment :( but i have one issue..... the game freezes all the time and i dont know why, is there a setting i can change for it to stop freezing my specs cpu: amd a10-6800k (more stuff) 4.10 ghz gpu: asus geforce gtx 760 oc ram: 8 gb power supply: 700w i have a cpu cooler",5.0

"you cannot go wrong with this game. you destroy hordes of enemies, ranging from the block-head corpus to the space zombie infested to the always-in-your-face grineer. and the destruction never gets old. if you dont want to spend any money on things, but get somewhere in a free game, then this is for you. you can get damn near any weapon or warframe free, jsut takes awhile. thats how i get 90 percent of my items. the amount of missions are vast, and the random map generations makes sure that nothing is ever the same. not to mention the bosses feel like actual leaders, who have propper strategies and they always require actual planning to take them down, unless you want to go down too. all in all, you cant find more badass space ninjas anywhere. best of luck, tenno.",278.4

"to be honest, the only reason this game is geting such amount of recommended rates is because its a free to play game. if people had to pay to play this game they would get really pissed off after a week or two if the dont like grinding games that much, because warframe is the king of grinding games. this game has alot of content, very cool content yes, but youll find yourself farming one item for countless hours and then waiting days for it to be available (after you get the materials for each item you have to wait for it to be finished, unless you pay). and this applies to everything, weapons, warframes, mods, mods mods. and of course, the bugs, i really dont want to write about this since i stoped playing a few patchs ago so maybe most of the bugs i encountered back when i was playing might got fixed already but holy f*ck did i find some *t bugs in this game. anyways, i got bored pretty fast but i cant say it was not worth the while, i had fun playing valkyr after i finished her completly, the animations and graphics are amazing and even though there are some warframes that are stronger than others all of them are viable and fun to play. download this game if you like ninjas, futuristic enviroment and if you dont mind grinding in a repetitive way for hours. after all, its free to play.",248.5

"to get to game play you must load the launcher, the launcher checks for updates, then launches the game, which takes a brief load. you must then wait for it to load some more for, sign in, and get another load screen. over 5 minutes of loading to even get to the game. after getting to the game, you must do the tutorial level, which, if youve already played the game and uninstalled it, you know how to play already, and you can not skip. you also do not get your equipment from your previous install, so you have to learn how to use the weapons and warframe you may not even have. after finishing the tutorial, you are then put on your ship, where an mmo like chat is happening in the bottom left hand corner. the chat was an awful place, with people being awful. all in all, i give this game a rating of why are there so many controls, and why did i just do a backflip / 10",18.5

"its pretty, well-designed, enjoyable and has lots of lovely weapons with which you can run around doing murders for kicks. however, it is an mmo and will likely eat your soul. that said, at least it doesnt try too hard to extort money out of you with microtransactions. if you work hard, literally anything (except the founders pack, which is basically just a reskin of the old newb kit and some other, non-gameplay-affecting stuff) the game has to offer is available to you. 9.5/10 would consign life to endless grinding again",208.4
"a really fun and different game, with a a large variety of weapons and awesome melee combos that changes it from a standard sci fi third person shooter. the only downside is the huge grindwall for resources in order to craft weapons and other loot. in fact id say this game currently is the worse ftp for acquiring new content due to the grind+wait time on crafting equipment(in my experience anyway). waiting a total of 36 hours to craft each part of a new warframe(armour) and then another 3 days to put each piece together is a terrible mechanic. if this game was not so fun and different then i would not recommend it. dont expect to get anywhere unless you dedicate a lot of gametime to this title.",187.2

"warframe is an amazing game for emphasizing your playstyle, each weapon is suited to a specific playstyle, or adaptive to make it fit your playstyle, this also can be said about the warframes themselves. mods further enhance playstyle to the very elements you want to fire out of your gun! while it is a grind, after that first loadout is bought and you have a new melee, primary, and secondary weapon, it becomes a game of using awesome mods and unique effects for each gun to mow down hundreds of enemies in different ways, using abilities lets you master the flow of combat. another thing great about this game is the animations, while they are triggered by player use on some, which can be a bit sudden, all animations look so smooth, and each weapon even has unique combos, stealth kills, finishers, and so on. i would highly recommend this game to anyone, and its ftp, but not necessarily ptw, the developers themselves said that everything in the game (besides color packs and excalibur prime, the donator frame) is obtainable for free. grinding to get a new weapon can be fun with friends, and the combat is so satisfying most of the time.",528.0

"this game is an example of free to play done (mostly) right, which is very rare. you, a member of the tenno race, are equiped with suits known as warframes, each with unique stats and powers. it is your mission to aid in the war between the tenno, grineer, corpus, and infested. admitadly, the game plays like a standard third person shooter, where it really shines is all of the different weapons and mods just waiting to be discovered, like bows to assault rifles, health increases to abilities. its not without its problems, though. the game is littered with microtransactions, and while optional, grinding isnt fun unless you have friends. oh yeah, this game has a standard 4 player co-op system too, which it is usually designed around. overall, i would suggest getting this game with a very open mindset.",700.5
"yes - very worth while f2p - download and play a few hours",152.7
"pros + good customisation. + good combat. + sound quality is excellent. cons - no clear story, your just thrown into the battle with no real reason to kill the enemies apart from your told to and that theyre shooting at you. - repetetive environments (jungle, factory, maybe if your lucky..... a bright factory). - odd weapon unlock system. overall i would reccomend this game for the combat and customisation alone however if you look for fun and story telling in a game then this isnt the game for you, the gore may give you some giggles for the first few times you make an enemies torso fly into space team rocket style but once youve seen one decapateted enemy sliced and diced like mince meat, youve seen them all.",19.5

"really enjoying the style of fast paced 3rd perso view shooter/slasher, accurate and very clean graphics. the graphics are of a very detailed and high quality even at lower settings. edit: 618 hours of gameplay later. very very dissapointed. the game is/has become unplayable for many users. constant crashes, frame rate issues, insane memory usage (alienware m17x, cpu 1~2%, ram 25% idle) play warframe..... cpu 40%, ram 67% then ram shoots up if you breathe too hard on your keyboard). the game is still such an unpolished gem. hotfixes are always being thrown in the mix, but what good is it if gaming stability affects the masses. sorry, but my vote is a no after 617+ hours of gameplay and real life money thrown into the hype. edit: oct 28th game is back and playable. it is a mastepiece that needs to be allowed a playable format. sorry for ing, but it is back and i am relieved.",1287.8

"i tried to play this game when it first came out but it was a bit to weird for me. but ive gotten back into it in the past few days. once i figured out how to do everything and got my keys all set up i love it. the movement in the game is amazing! the ablility to run up along walls and climb on and jump on pretty much everything in the environment is awesome. i find the game menu a bit confusing with all the planets but its not to bad. the customization is pretty cool. i havent found much to buy with in game money yet, but im sure what will come. most of the stuff seems to have a real money cost. i like the idea behind it. its pretty original. so if you are looking for something new that combines a lot of different types of combat check it out.",25.4

"warframe is kind of like mass effect 3s multiplayer but better in many ways. it has a power system similar to me3s power system, but it has a variety of missions instead of only a deffence/horde mode. it has some really cool weapons. and it has bows. these bows are what sold me when i first started. i saw a bow in the store and spent $10 to buy the thing faster than *put flash joke here*. its not a pvp game. some of the warframes, like rhino, are really op in pvp. but overall its a good time, especially with friends. i should note that you can buy almost anything in the game via plat, this does lead to a pay 2 win kind of game. you can get almost anything in the game via plat / trading, but you can get everything in the game without paying anything. a lot of the weapons in the store are around 275 plat (which is really overpriced) and warframes will run from 75-375. (which is a little better because of the pain it is to build them) i must stress here that warframe is the most fun when you are just playing and not grinding for something. yes, grinding is something that you have to do in order to get anyware in warframe, but (at least for me) this does not ruin the overall experience.",297.2

"while some of the gameplay might come off as repetitive, there is no denying that destroying enemies in ever new and inventive ways is part of the fun. warframe is a generally middle-paced action based game that takes place in the future with two major factions you will encounter most of the time, the corpus and the grineer. there are others as well that can be encountered on certain planet missions to invasion events to crafting keys to access areas not normally open without the right materials. but, it is not just the game that makes it fun. it is also the development team that is behind it and they have been very supportive of the community and very fast to make fixes whenever there are problems. i remember when there was an issue with being unable to connect to the server some time ago and i honestly expected to be off for several days and maybe even weeks. they fixed the issue in hours. not only are they fast, they also do their best to keep in close contact with the player base. the only major downside i would say are some of the fellow players who can be rather entitled at times when it comes to demanding for this or demanding for that. but, that naturally comes with a large community. the higher the population base, the higher the statistical chance of encountering the less than pleasant members of society. still, i highly recommend the game and who knows? i might even encounter you. cheers and happy holidays to all who read this during the time of this post.",885.5

"although at first its quite difficult to get used to, but once you get past the non-existant tutorial and some clunky wallrunning mechanics, you have a real gem. this game is incredible. it is sci-fi action at its best, short of mass effect 2. interesting story with characters they have yet to fully develop and explore. constantly updating with new weapons, gear and frames, not to mention custom colours, skins & visuals. gameplay is great, fast-paced with high-flying melee combat. one of the few games that has a realistic dive-shoot mechanic. some slow-mo, bows, rifles, shotguns, machine guns, swords, shurikens, sniper rifles, pistols, boomerangs. you name a gun, theyre probably working on it. but it is certainly not overwhelming. audio is good, with some blandness, but its still in beta so expect that to change over time. solid game modes and character mutation. features mod cards which alter the abilities of both your warframe and your weapons. want an increased clip? got it. need some radioactive arrows? got it. want your boomerang to have explosive damage? got it. incredibly deep rpg elements and leveling system. each gun has its own level along with each warframe, not to mention rewards for continually logging in. i cant find a real fault at all. especially conssidering its free!!!!!",457.6

"warframe was a absolutely amazing game. until the archwings. the numerous bugs ive encountered have mostly all been with the new archwing gamemode (and in particular, the limbo theorem quest.) (dont get me wrong though, everything else with this game is absolutely perfect.) i was recently playing this quest when i noticed many things wrong about the gamemode (i was playing the interception mode). first of all, i noticed the grineer have absolutely no idea what contesting an objective is. no matter what the grineer instantly capture points despite me being there to contest them. instantly. secondly, the grineer spawn in basically unstoppable and unrelenting swarms. seriously, its like an ork waaaaagh. though that may be just because im not that high of a level with my archwing stuffsydoodles. thirdly, when you do complete the mission, i find it difficult to kill them all. mostly because theyre inside the asteroids. good luck getting to them. and then theres the constant crashing. in game, in the loading screen, and, wierdly enough, in the launcher menu- thing. all the crashes all the time, and you dont keep your rewards when you crash. it really sucks. overall, warframe is a great game, and i hope it will continue to be so. but the archwing is just too much rage for me to handle xd. i really hope these bugs will be fixed asap, but until then (or until i manage to actually complete the limbo quest without too much crashing and rage!) im giving this a nosauce.",153.3

"the current game is quite enjoyable. despite still being in a beta stage there is quite a lot of content, the combat system is dynamic and allows a lot of different playstyles. but since it is a beta it there are alos some bugs (which happen every now and then but generally dont cause too much problems (though youll probably have to manually abort a few missions or alt+f4 the game). a few bugs ive encountered: game hanging on trying to find a squad, some hosting problems (especially if the host disconects), getting the wrong map, enemies not spawning correctly (like they dont spawn for a while - though this is great if you get this in interception missions <- atype of point capture mission). clan battles (battles between clans that allow non clan members to fight for either side) are in my experience pretty laggy at times. ive several times experienced massive desyncs where i had to actually guess where the enemy that i just saw will be for my attacks to hit and see what i did seconds after it or even be completely unable to change or use my weapons. this is not a common problem but since the game is still in beta stage dont be surprised if it happens to you too. i really am looking forward to see how this game will evolve especially to see if lotus (your ingame advisor/boss figure) will start giving actually useful inmission advice (instead of the usual ambigous you are surrounded by enemy or a lot of enemies ahead, prepare for a fight).",100.5

"im a fan of the muliplayer fps, mmo and rpg scenes. i love the idea of an fps in a diablo suit, but i was worried it would be too repetitive. would the replayability be there? the answer: a circumstantial yes. i would highly reccomend that you play this game with friends. if you are solo the game can quickly become tedious. however, with friends time flies by! something else that is not readily apparent - there is a somewhat steep learning curve to this game. understanding how mods interact with polarity slots, how damage is calculated, various weaknesses and strengths, and learning all the warframes (really what style of play suits you) can be a daunting task. new players will find the first system of missions easy enough, but will soon find enemies that prove a real challenge. the correct application of mods on your warframe and weapons will be essential. all in all digital extremes is putting in a great deal of work into making this game an amazing experience. updates are constant. its free to play with an ingame store for both normal currency and paid currency. everything that can be bought with real money can also be obtained without real money (except extra inventory space and a few cosmetics) and without too much difficulty. try it out - what have you got to lose?",276.3

"you either love or hate this game. me, i ended up uninstalling it, but its not bad, actually quite good compared to others, and worth a try to anyone, plus its free. in short, the game has so many things it does right, yet so many things it does wrong, at least in my opinion. you might enjoy the combat, the variety of mission types, the possiblities of all those weapons and warframes, and the (now) streamlined hud/interface, along with endless replayiblity and decent netcode, with the games amazing optimization and graphics topping it off. or, you could be annoyed by the excessive grindiness, the monotony of missions, the (at times) brutal unfairness of the enemies, the awful parkour and melee, among other things. i more commonly encountered the latter, the reason why i uninstalled the game, but to be honest, like i said, the game has some pretty awesome things about it. i believe a lot of people exaggerate the bad points - the stuff i mentioned is bad, but not that bad. i ended up very mixed about this game, somewhat actually in between. i would recommend just giving this game a try, seeing if, whether to you, the good things surpass the bad, or vice versa. after all, its free - what have you got to lose?",40.8

"its free, its everything a third person shooter/ hack n slasher should be. its ninjas in space, for crying out loud! its a game worth investing as it pays you back every cent with every minute you put into it. its vast, immersive, beautifully crafted. words cannot describe the direction this masterpiece has taken from its small roots to this vast entity that keeps on giving back. you get tired, take a little break, play it again, and wonder why you ever stopped. if there was ever a game deserving of a 10/10, it is warframe.",483.7
"incredible for a free game, has alot of content most of which can be gained through the game itself, some things have to be bought using the premium currency but thats mostly just for looks, also its one of the only mmos ive seen with direct combat! very fun, very much recommended!",273.3

"so much fun !!!!! i started playing about two weeks and the game is amazing! the graphics are great and the different weapons and warframes with their unique abilities is just so cool. i reccommend this game for all sci-fi and shooter lovers!",66.8
"probably the best free-to-play game i played so far. its not an mmo. you just join a battle and play till the end and then over and over again. during first 30 hours of gameplay you realize how many different cool things out there and want to check all of them out. then you play for about 100 hours more enjoying a very dynamic gameplay and trying to finish all the planets. whenever you think youve done probably everything you may find yourself in a situation where youd want to farm a lot of very rare things. ive played for almost 300 hours and i havent yet upgraded even a single weapon or warframe to a perfect state. not to say less this game is really amazing and with frequent updates and changes to mechanics the game becomes even more amazing.",622.5
"since i last played this game in closed beta and left it due to it lagging on my computer along with choppy movement, the amount of updates that the developers have put forth is amazing! warframes premise for the game is unique and is continuously being built upon. theres a learning curve to the game, but once you learn it, it is a lot more enjoyable. also, playing with friends and making new ones is always good! :d",204.3
"a lot of running good combat animations alot of hack and slash in 3rd person mode. remembers me a game named oni i played like 10 or 12 years ago maybe..",11.4
"incredibly fast paced flexible gameplay, insanely fun, tough to master",296.1
"warframe is set in a universe where the solar system is locked in unending conflict between the tenno, the corpus, and the grineer, while the infestation threat looms over all three. you can carry out a number of different mission types to collect materials, credits, blueprints, and simply prove your skills while culling the unending threat. warframe is a game about farming at its core. you collect materials to make more weapons, warframes, and companions, eventually switching to new ones while customizing abilities and stats to suit your play-style. and while the game is in essence about farming, the combat, power, and movement systems allow one to create a very entertaining spectacle of flashing steel and lead. run on a wall, jump off, spin like a helicopter, and decapitate a grineer soldier, then top off the display by landing into a graceful slide followed immediately by another instantaneous guillotine slash from your weapon. learning to carry out movement combinations and power uses all while using firearms and blades of all sort is what makes this game really enjoyable. but, you might eventually get tired of the farming and look for a different experience.",523.2

"sooooooooooooo many of the kools were put into this game",60.2
"this game is one the best free to play game over u have to get it because i say so and it good",20.0
"although this game is still constantly changing, i find that there remains one constant: fun. i know, i know. the missions all start to blur together and we all hate that dreaded escort mission where the prisoner goes full  and dives into a group of grineer, but truly this gamme continues to bring the fun. day in, day out. it gets a little negative hype with the possibility of pay to win, but whether you spend $1 or $100 on this game, you still end up having an absolute blast with it. i definitely recommend this game...especially if you have friends to play it with.",192.6
"well its nice game to play with friends or yourself. but everytime the game update, a lot of bugs comes out.",281.7
"by far my favorate free to play games ive played, played alot on my ps4 and put some money into it and now getting started on pc good game if you dont mind some serious grinding to get what you want.",10.4
"warframe is a great game with a few bugs but it is still in beta, i strongly recommend it.",53.5
"one of the most fun games ive played in a long time. simple yet challenging. a tad buggy from time to time (it is still in beta) but overall a great game!",976.9
"good game if ya like rng, grinding, guns, waiting, space ninjas with superpowers, guns and sword play, flying around space with butt-thrusters, using an attack dog that will cost you an arm and a leg, not having to pay money to actually advance in the game (though it helps later), and having crapmed fingers from all of the fun your having, this is the game for you. its the poor persons destiny",767.2
"its a great game. along with co-op you have get to have neat player abilities, which if paired up with other warframes you and your friends can be devastating against your enemies. its free, the gameplay is fun, and for a free-to-play its very pretty. so space-ninjas... need i say more? 8.5/10 (8.5 because its takes so long to get new weapons and other warframes! >.< but hey, all the more reason to shoot stuff right?)",427.2
"awesome recommend it dawnload it if u want to get extreme fun baby",595.8
"have you ever wanted to be a ninja. no you say. still get this game",104.7
"fantastic co-op shooter. you can play solo if you prefer and there is still a sense of challenge. rank up your warframe, weapons and minion bot and add mods to customise their damage and shields. clan dojos you can build up together with materials that drop in missions. the item store is purely for cosmetic or to rush getting weapons/warframes. everything in the shop can be acquired in-game.",194.8
"a bit confusing and not quite to my taste. the gameplay seems sloppy, and the lack of any real direction make this game a turd.",0.5
"somewhat repetative, but the rpg element and leveling system is strong and rewarding. you will want to grind for hours. my advice: buy the 20 or 40$ booster pack at some point as they make leveling and farming very easy to begin with. wait till they go on sale. game is playable without paying, but a better experience if you do. good ballance.",123.5
"beatiful game love the weapons and creation and the design of the game itself it has more than this to come and i wish to see a never ending game that proves it is the best 10/10 c======{}::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::>",2.3

"i love everything about this game there is absolutly nothing i dislike;)",178.8
"the mobility in this game is insane. the ability to flip around, wall run, climb, jump over, and jump off just about every object in the game is awesome. good for all play styles. whether youre a stealth player, or a run in guns blazing player, warframe can accommodate.",183.7
"pretty good free to play game, community isnt as bad as expected combat is fluid it isnt pay 2 win in game cash is used to modify your class mods and upgrade weapons platinum is used to buy warframes (new champions) all in all i would recommend this game, for a bit of casual fun or maybe to try something new",237.2
"best game ive played in years, active devs that listen to the community, updates every week with a lot of content, many hotfixes, not pay 2 win!!",893.9
"if only other game companies had as amazing speed at bug fixes and patching as this team does. oh did you know this game has ninjas? by god does it have ninjas. mesa is waifu for life. 10/10",2.3
"very cool mechanics. unless youre impatient, not necessary to buy to win. even so, buy to win seems to play a more aesthetic mechanic to the game. each warframe has 4 abnilities that you earn as you play, and each gun can use special mechanics, like increased damage, elemental, and increased fire rate. the parkour elements are very cool as well, since each warframe has varying speeds and agility",111.2
"it is a very fun third person shooter, with a very active dev team that is always working on the next big update and always keeping it fresh and new.",186.8
"its a great game, but the only thing that sucks is that you cant earn all the characters for free.",47.2
"i love the game but is their a way to grind faster?",173.2
"warframe is a fun, decent game on its own thats at its best when you play with a few friends and grind for hours on end for new warframes and weapons. youll most likely be farming and grinding continously, which after a while will wear thin. the sliding mechanics are fun to play with and melee is somewhere in between fun and clunky. its not a bad game, but it lacks the polish and lasting appeal for me to recommend it to anyone. 5/10",59.9
"yhis game is awsome great combat and beatiful terrain and lighting !",278.1
"ninjas? check. guns? check. swords? check. superpowers? awesome! sign me up!",112.6
"i still love this game even its nearly 2 year. probably the best f2p game i have played. compare to the game before updates, i really do like it much now. but this game will still getting bored after playing for few month. when that happen, just play some other games and come back later. just got through 1000hr, 2000hr is my next goal.",1088.8
"this game can be a very good experience. the community is great, the trade system is pretty active and healthy, the levels are interesting. every weapon and ability can be unique and fun. in general. this is one of the best games i have played in a while. i have had to delete it from my computer a few times in order to get work done...",539.3
"biggest update ive ever seen! its huge and there is not one time where i cant find a game online! the game became huge!",5.0
"welp, all my friends were telling me to play it. i finally did, and it was fun, but its too repetitive, and i could see that within an hour of gameplay :/",2.1
"i started playing this game way back when it first hit steam and let me tell you, there wasnt much to be had there. it was a great concept and didnt seem like anything more than a coop thing. come into the last year or so and this game has made amazing progress and the fact that practically this game is 100% free given the fact you can trade items for platinum (game credits) to which you can use to speed up timers, buy those aesthetic items or bluerints. you dont have to actually spend money for this game; but i can almost guarantee you will want to at some point. warframe login rewards will occasionally reward you with a 50% off coupon + free plat on platinum purchases to help regulate plat flow in the markets, and give you a taste of what platinum can do. again platinum is not needed for everything, as most things can be either farmed or bought with in-game money. but some things will require plat either excluseively or to help expedite things. the core gameplay is somewhat grindy, as youll be running missions for dailies, clearing planets to uncover new ones, gathering materials to craft new gear or items, or even gathering gear itself. recently, updates have changed how melee works and have also introduced clans and pvp. future updates are told to bring actual space play involving jetpacks. tl;dr try the game. its free. you could spend money if you wanted, but its not needed. for a current gen game that has online play, free, goals and objectives, why not try it?",227.5
"fun game that melds mass effect 3 multiplayer with diablo style dungeon crawling. easy to pick up, and even easier to get addicted. this game really shines when you can play with friends - as it is all about cooperative play.",94.0
"its free you fools! its kinda pay-to-win, but your weapons do get more op as you use them. it has hours of content, and after that, more content. enjoy beating this one, folks.",19.2
"this is a free game thats not multiplayer! awesome.",13.8
"fun free game, great time waster to play with friends.",149.0
"whats not to love with this title? space ninjas lots of guns and hell of a lot of fun with friends. i cant help but reccomend this game, the only thing it requires is patients as you are unlikely to get any new equpiment within the first day or so. you sould probably think about dropping some money on platinum (cash store credits) at some point its not needed but it sure makes things easyer!",151.1
"recommended for all people who wish to play a free to play game which can play both shooting and close combat style. the game is free so you dont need to purchase any $ to get all the weapons or warframes in game (only some unlimited items if you wish to purchase - the rest you can farm meterials to craft). overall: i love this game, i know it is not perfect and can get bored when you get all stuffs from the game but it is the good game you can play with your friends or solo and make friend in group of region.",575.6
"rather unstable at the moment, but still a rather entertaining co-op third person shooter.",51.0
"its an amazing third person shooter. it has missions you can play with friends, quests, and even parkour! the amazing part is that its almost lag free!",18.3
"oh wow! these were the first words i said aloud as i started this game. let me sum it up, you play as space ninjas wielding magic(?) powers to destroy all in your path. running/wall-running/spinning/jumping/flipping/slide attack! oh wow just moving around in this game is a blast! this game is free to play and everything in this game can be earned by simply playing and working hard at it too. image running through an armored ship killing and looting as you go, when the wall next to you explodes as troops from another faction poor out of a pod and rain hot lead in all directions! the ship is being bombarded and ripped apart throwing everything into space. the only thing saving you is your ship that gives you wings to fly in space! humming your favorite star wars tune as you whip through what is left of the massive ship to continue your goal. so what have you got to lose!? its free give it a shot!",686.4

"warframe is immensly diverse in all aspects; from creating your character to just building something in the foundry. it has incredible team play and great missions types. there is also a real sense of comradery among players. theres so much to do and complete its no wonder some players have been playing a full year from its release and still have tons to do. the look of the the game is unbelievable,the graphics alone are top notch and pull you in just from the title screen. the controls feel fluid and absolutely flawless. aside from all the positive comments i can throw at this game, the only negative gripe i have is the connectivity to their servers when entering/leaving a mission when in multiplayer, and also host migration seems like it needs some technical tweaks. if the mere seemless possibilities to expand, explore, and create and over the top gameplay dont pull you in, then the 1gb download and free access most definitely will.",927.5
"short form of my review ( im too lazy to write a long version) : the gameplay is fun ( fun factor is at his best with friends ), the graphics are good ( isnt really needed as a + point because in my opinion graphics dont matter that much), its definitly worth a try. so grab some friends an hop in!",73.0
"the best things about this game exist entirely by accident from the developers. manages to be both the least fun rng fueled  grindfest ive played and also best relaxing just destroy hundreds of enemies at once with ridiculously overpowered weaponry for no particular reason game at the same time. really grindy and buggy/10.",982.1
"oh..youre about to get that loki prime systems bp after wave 20? *the host has lost connection* oh look, a bo prime handle! *the host has lost connection* look! your friends are on, and want to do some tiv exterminate! *session failed* trying to squad up to catch that event before it ends? *squads up with 5-6 people* aw, it looks like you missed it..you have too many people in your squad, silly. if youre going to play warframe, dont play it through steam.",213.8
"its great for a free to play. the pay wall is a challenge but not impossible to over come, as long as you have time. most good gear can be gotten through paying for it of course, but if you have the time most items can also be made through the games crafting system, it just requires a lot of materials that take a long time to harvest. the combat is great fun though, it feels much faster and more fluid than many mmos. however it is an instance mmo, not open world. its just a mash of match after match. at this point and time id say warframe, hawken and tera are the best f2p games out there. with a tie between warframe and tera for the best. this is also quite fun on the ps4, but it doesnt handle as well, wall running is a real challenge with a controller.",22.1
"awesome game. lots of grinding but thats the fun of it all, meeting new players or having fun with a group of friends. f2p only charging for cosmetics as everything else is craftable(be patient, it can take up days to craft some items.) overall, an 8.9/10 in my book. solid gameplay, plenty of cool weapons and warframes to give a try. just dl it and play already! :)",30.3
"flying space ninjas in space, it is so fun but i found it to be to heavey on the grind at some stages, but overall youll have fun from the amount of parkor and slide melee fliping ninkas",398.3
"wait for the developer to fix all the bug, good game, but many bugs",125.5
"its kinda grindy, the controls kinda wonky, multiplayer squad play leaves much to be desired, the damage system is complicated, and everything becomes kinda of samey. its an amazing and beautiful concept that i would recommend to play for a few good months, but it gets boring fast.",319.5
"this game has heavily influenced my switch from the generic mmo rpg to the action-rpg format that i once hated, but now enjoy more than anything, other than premaridal affairs ;). the textures and postprocessing in warframe prove to keep the player immersed in the games universe for hours on end, as well as the sound track. originally when i was made aware of the cross-platform title i cringed, but as they proved this was both possible and able to be done properly. i give kudos to those who labored for years to make this possible. thank you to the production team and the programmers who made this game, the masterpiece that it is. i will be logging in as soon as my steam client is up to date.",21.6
"this game is phenominal. if you are looking for an intense online sci-fi third person shooter, youve found it right here! assume the role of a tenno warframe, busting out some ninja parkour moves to get around with a very smooth movement system, craft your own weapons, kill enemies, find mods, use mods to upgrade your weapons, and much much more. i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an amazing online co-op shooter!",50.7
"alot like the console game destiny only that its a tps and not fps. the thing i like most is that it has alot of game content and that it also has a singleplayer mode also in which there are public events! so if a person cant finish a level by himself he can contact a friend and they can do the misiion together!",741.3
"this game is fun and very action packed but lacks variety, most levels have you running around slicing bad guys and occasionaly a slightly stronger foe (a boss). i would say that this games strongest point is the co-op, you can have great fun with a couple or even one friend. the combat system is satisfying and bloody but can get a bit repetitive (shoot him, slice him, shoot him, slice him). there are plenty of collectables in this game but it is largely pay to win. however it is free to play and gave me plenty of enjoyable hours. overall i would give this game a 7/10",4.9
"nice graphics , nice storyline(nothing special but still works well overall),rl fun to play,has improved much from beta,very nicely done combat system,newbies wont get lost,(for some people it may be hard to master....also depending the class you choose). rl nice game i look forward to it :) ...and watch better?its completely free :d 8/10",4.9

"fun fun fun. if u like mass effect 3 muliplayer this game is a must for you. everything in game that cost money can be gotten in game from playing it and getting parts, blueprints, etc. if there ever a game you should try if u like 3rd person shooters, with hackand slash features. also the game is in the beta and they are trying out a stealth approch system to the game, for those of you that like to sneak or stealth about. a must try game cant wait to see the final product",190.5

"one of the most addicting and beautiful free-to-play games out there i highly recomend it. its kind of like a tps-mmo because of the powers you get on each warframe. the wepons are ok some of them are terrible,but on the bright side you can get great a huge longsword (galatine) and bladed boomarang (glave) sadly you can only get a glave by using platinum (real life money) and login rewards.so all in all i totaly recomended it",445.3

"so far i have really like this game. the game play and the customizabilty are awesome. as of right now, the only constructive critizism i have is that when you are in front of an enemy, plainly in thier line of site, they dont see you if you are outside of a 5 meter radius roughly. so the only thing i would change to make it more realistic would change that enemys will engage once you are in thier line of site within a reasonable distance.",142.5

"warframe is a very good and addictive game, you will spend a lot of time on it. the game also get updated very frequently with more and more things for you to do with your friends or simply other players around the world, it is a very good game in my opinion because it is not a pay to win game. give it a try if you like coop games :d",9.6

"the game got an interface redo which is targeted at the playstation 4 players who total out at about 20% of the playerbase. this redo made the game unplayable by inducing motion sickness, hiding vital options somewhere 4-6 klicks deep which you have to access over and over again, removing the starmap for some sort of planet spin wheel including a mission spin wheel, implementing senseless color codes, hiding important info behind your character model, removing the option to change your loadout quickly before a mission launches, screwing with the mod interface so that you have to memorize dozens if not hundreds of your mods by name now. i easily put 100 into the game and was really into it but this ui update flat out killed it.",583.2

"with a great assortment of weapons and warframes to choose from warframe can certainly give you a lot of playtime as you explore the solar system. it was the first game i have ever played which made me want to spend the money on it rather than finding ways to wring it out of my pockets. the development teams is great but after having invested over 400 hours of fun gameplay you do tend to lose interest. overall a wonderful free to play game, definately worth your time to try. it does have a steep learning curve so bring a friend who knows or look at the wiki, that is being worked on but for the moment its your best friend.",1099.3

"to be honest warframe is a good game with potential but de are making too many mistakes. yea its a game where you can slice and guy then u burn him then u watch him fall to the ground but there is only so far that ccan get you. once you get into the game the game get repetitive. although i personally dont mind but at times farming items can get annoying. in conclusion this willl be a great game some day but for now it needs more input from the community.",537.3

"buggy as all getout, constantly lose precious mission loot. support? dont bother, they just sit on their hands and dont care.",294.6
"i love this game its fun when you play it with your friends",1.7
"its an amazing game, ultimately flawed for many either due to its lack of pvp for some and repetitive item grinding nature. if you can look over those two issues that some will have, you will have an outstanding game with ninjas flipping of walls throwing elemental force powers while, with steady upgrades from a determined developer the game is well supported. its pricing model is a little rough, however there is a daily login reward which after consistent daily activity you have the chance of a 75% off the purchase of currency, then everything is good with the model.",269.8
"warframe is one of the best ftp games i have ever played. maybe even the best. although there is an option to purchase some items with real money, it is not needed. you can play the game and unlock everything without spending a dime. recently (a couple of months ago) a huge update came out and made the game even better then it was before. in warframe you are an elite ninja alien warrior that can performe badass movements like running on walls, sliding, backflips and more. there a 15+ warframes you can play but you have unlock then via blueprints or buying them with platinum (in game currency). there are many different planets you can unlock by playing the game and beating the levels. the are many enviroments ranging from interiors of space ships, lush green lands, and arctic lands. warframe is an amazing game but it may take a little bit of time to master all the different types of jumps and parqor you can do. if capable computer to run warframe then there is no reason not to get it.",23.4

"fun for some time, but then it gets reeeeeeaaaaaaalllllyyyyyyyyyy grindy. i am over 20 hours in and there has been no progression at all.",25.4
"amazing game for what i`ve played of it. this is a beautiful looking game, great idea behind it and relatively refreshing feel to an fps. controls aren`t terrible, but could be better. the tutorial explains combat well but i have no clue how to get better weapons/upgrade mine without paying real money. the weapons also seem unbalanced, basically giving you no reason to use anything but your primary unless you`re practically on top of an enemy. i also hate the fact i need to buy colour packs. i`d be fine with that if it gave you basic colours first, but of course you`re given dilluted colours and shades (ie: light green instead of green, turqoise instead of blue, pink instead of red, grey instead of black). other than my rant about the problems in this game, it really is a great game and i`d recommend it to anyone. i`m truly baffled that this game is free, i would have paid for this! this is more than worth the space on your computer.",3.4

"warframe is a great game because it has a little something for everyone. the games warframes supplement each possible playstyle. a few bugs are present, which should not deter players since it is in beta stage. warframe has crafting for the people who like to make cool stuff, small puzzles for geniuses, a looting mechanic, the ability to make any weapon a total beast, and a variety of weapons to fit any playstyle: the sprayer, the sniper, the heavy hitter, etc. the music is awesome at first, but gets a bit repetitive after a while, but gamemodes are fun and are challenging if given time, even the first stage has challenging levels. bosses are a bit overpowered but drop great items. warframe is incomparable with other third-person shooters, you could say its a different breed.",134.7
"ever since the mesa update, my warframe would not allow me to join any games with other people. everytime i join a game, it tells me that the  connection to the multiplayer host has been lost. all i am able to do is play games by myself. i recommend this game to eveybody but this is the only problem.",411.3

"a very fun a game 8/10 for me! this game is the best co-op f2p game i have ever played. the best part is when you and your friends play it for 10 hours straight! the only down side to this game is that it gets a little grindy/repetitive after a while of playing. also there is no need to buy any packs for this game, it is fun anyways.",16.4
"very impressive f2p game. the controls take a little getting used to but are tight overall. this is a beatiful game with large almost overwhelming areas to explore. you do come back down to earth eventually because the large areas are reused enough to take away a bit of the novelty. new areas and ways to play the game open to extend your enjoyment. this is necessary because the repetitve grinding does have the potential to get boring. the new areas, guns, ect probably do not come fast enough though. make sure you go into this cyber ninja sci-fi epoch with a co-op partner that wont bail on you and you have to cry yourself to sleep in you stasis pod. 6.5/10",58.6

"i didnt end up putting very much time into warframe, but when the intro missions are the way they are - full of idiot monsters (grineer) with poor ai, two weapon shenanigans, a regenerating shield to allow you as many mistakes as you want, a lazy soundtrack, and the most annoying guide character since alia in the mega man x series, its hard to justify putting in enough time to even get to the pay-to-win stage.",1.9
"i used to love warframe very much. but then, when ive unlocked sedna and phobos, enemies are tougher to kill, enemies can airborne while warframe cant (not archwing) and enemies weapons can damaged your shield very fast. mine was from 900+ shield to 200- within 10 seconds on rhino equipped with steel fiber ranked 8. i did cashed out from money to purchase some items. i realized that its all a waste! theyre uselss! only for f***ing decorations to make looks cool and awesome not the weapons! dont cash out some money for platinums! its a waste for money! i couldve buy other games like far cry 4 or sniper ghost warrior 2!",197.9

"really fun game. you can get almost every thing in game by farming. not pay to play like a lot of other games. the lore is still in the works so you cant expect too much but its still pretty good. farming and levelling up weapons and warframes is really fun too and at times, challenging. 7.8/10",880.1
"awesome game, my opionion on this game is the same as on section 8: prejudice, great way to let out frustration and overall good game and gameplay. camera angles can be a little annoying sometimes",19.6

"be an epic parkour space ninja and fight aliens with your friends!",24.7
"ive been playing this game since beta about half a year ago and i cant begin to explain how aweosme this game is! its a challenge and a ton of fun. you have to choice to do so much. creating and customizing your warframe has to be the best part just waiting for it to be done is suspenseful. the game says you can be a ninja but in in my view your a god with awesome abliilties depeding on your warframe. each warframe has different abilities it on depends on which one you pick or any warframe bluepring you pick up. this game has changed a ton honestly so much to do you can upgrade your warframe to be more badass and your weapons too. you can even have this little sential that will follow you around kill, heal or hack for you. there really isnt much of story line that i can remember but its a ton of fun! its an online game you can switch the settings so you play with others or just rock out by yourself. no one can kill you but its a ton of fun at times to play with others whp actually know what their doing. this game is worth it all at the end short download and alot of detail and action! download it now you wont regret a thing once you try it and get use to it.",35.9

"fun game if you like doing backflips, wall climbing, and lots of par-core. on top of a space shooter. so basicly your a freaking space ninja!!!",177.2
"this is honestly one of the best games ive played in a long time. the closest thing i can compare it to is the multiplayer from mass effect 3. it takes a couple of level before the game starts to pick up the pace (should be faster now with the streamlines ability mods). the team at digital extremes adds content on a weekly basis and releases major expansions quite often. even if you dont put any money into it right away, you can hold off as money is only needed to store more equipment in the arsenal. everything that is bought is either cosmetic or just pay for convenience.",1286.0
"dont get me wrong when i say at at least one point in our life, we all wanted to be a ninja or a pirate. warframe combines both of these fantasies as you blaze across the solar system as a robotic ninja-assassin space pirate. can you name anything more awsome than that? although the levels get quite repetative when its either a space-station, a high-tech mine or the surface of a snow-covered planet the maps and rooms are so beautifully designed what more could you want? (aside from, yknow a tropical island) movement is amazing and flows beautifully, want to run along the wall over a bottomless pit, before running up another wall to introduce a clone-grown space marine to your katana? go for it, you crazy, crazy . its like a beautiful ballet of death and dismemberment. there are characters (warframes) for all skillsets and play styles from tanks, to nukers, from support to debuff, its all here, folks! if you enjoy the idea of combining swords, guns, honour and parkour warframe is definately the game for you!",238.7

"this game has you playing as ****ing space ninjas with shotguns. is there anything left to say? i would think not.",60.8
"warframe only has room for improvement, while yes it is still in the beta phase of development, the community for this game and the way that the founders of the game react to what their players say is astronomically better than any video game i have ever heard of. its fluid graphics and wide range of cuztomizeable gameplay is well past what the games of today have to offer besides its mother ing space ninjas",422.2
"while the lack of end game content is limited to the t4s and outer planets it is enjoyable to say the least. every mission does a great job at making your warframe feel like a complete badass. plus the addition of dev blogs on fridays gives the opportunity to tune in and see what the devs have planned for the next update.",628.6

"this is one of the best third person shooter games iv played in a long time. it featers intense combat, great graphics, alot of variety for every play style and most importantly balance. this game balanced its pay/free aspects perfectly, you can make all weapons and warframes in the game, the only difference is you have to wait. this is really good because pay to win players have no advantages over you and you can both enjoy the game the same way. it has lots of weapons, lots of characters amazing combat and is all around an exeptional game i played it so much im waiting for them to implement more content. and still im alwase coming back for more. for a free game thats incredible, plus you will earn discounts on platnium (pay for currency) and you can get up to 75% off, iv gotten a 30$ pack for 7$ and it is worth every penny. this game is exeptional.",102.2
"very fun and addictive. this game boasts tons of collectables to enhance your playthrough, and gameplay immesnly. although at times, warframe may feel like a grind to get that item you really really need for crafting, if you got your friends to back you up, your pretty much unstoppable! i would reccomend warframe to people who like -rpgs -third/first person shooter games.",8.9

"this game is awesome!!! somewhat tactical as for the mods that you want to apply, nice details, large maps, cool flappy birds too! warframes have its own excellent ability and quite easy to control, so i would recommend this game. however, the 50 platinums the de give us, not much things to do with it! plus many people would not wanna buy platinums, and hacking would feel wrong... what can we do after the 50 plats have been used up? nothing, pretty much. so, maybe this could be one small downside but others than that... good game",916.7

"after just 90 minutes of playtime im impressed with this free to play shooter and offers just as much enjoyment as games such as dead space 3 and mass effect 3 ..... being a free to play game i was initially expecting a average game with a sad storyline and mediocre graphics but instead i was greeted with a amazing shooter with some impressive gameplay ..... i wont go too deep but warframe is a no-brainer and even the updates dont take too long ... so what are you waiting for ..... download and install today !",0.1

"warning: prepare to shell out 20$ if you plan to play for more than a day or two. the game itself is pretty fun and brings a very satisfying gameplay. really no reason to download and try for a few hours. all items can be acquired (slowly) just by playing. the only thing players are really forced to buy are permanent inventory space, which is a must, since there are alot of weapons you will want to get and warframes. that being said, prepare for the game to get very repetative after first 72 hours of playtime. there is no real endgame, and all missions become repetative grinds for mod cards and resources.",277.6
"this is an excellent, ever expanding game. they are constantly putting in new weapons and expansions to it to keep the gameplay fresh.",282.6
"its an really fun game good if u are looking for an space game when u walk around and shoot things",10.9
"fantastic, but if it has first person mode, this will make me crazy.",20.9
"probably my favorite free game our there right now, others include path of exile, ghost recon online, league of legends, and loadout. this is a great example of how the business model in a f2p game should be. any item that you can buy for real money, you can easily get for free. anything that you cant get for free is purely cosmetic. graphics are great for a free game, and crafting a new gun or warfame just never seems to get boring. it is kind of a grindfest though, and after spending almost 200 hours into this, im starting to get burnt out... its still in beta and ive heard that the devs are gonna start to change things a bit, make it more interesting. as it stands now its a must play. its free, so theres nothing to lose :).",470.6
"it was fun at first but since i didnt want to pay money it got way to hard",8.9
"fun game, seems to improve every month or so.. still has some bugs but thats to be expected. would def recommend this game.",998.6
"this game is proof that the whole 30/60fps debacle is utter . this game is just one frame, a warframe, and it still looks really good. its obvious that fps is completely irrelevant to the smoothness of the visuals in a game. just one frame is enough to make a game look and run smoothly.",18.4
"absolute badassness. basic day in this game wake up attack space cyborgs get attacked by said space cyborgs attack space clone zombie things (no really what are the grineir?) kill their leader fly through space on a jet pack. get into your space ship and pop a space beer and whatch space hockey in space",9.1
"while graphically beautiful and high twitch and fluid action this game lacks a variety that keeps the continued play value that i usually like to see. basically if you wnat ot log on and kill a bunch of stuff, then this is the game for you. they attempted to provide variety with collecting and building different weapons and power ups however this merely turned the game into a grind, looking for item components.",57.5
"out of the many games i play i still find myself drawn to warframe from time to time. it starts a long time after the game dark sector and the lore and the characters are simple enough for a child to understand. warframe is a must have if you are strapped for cash and looking for both a stealth and assault type of entertainment. the controls are fluid, the graphics are amazing and the overall feel of the game seems to be alive. warframe also sets a f2p point of genius by making almost every item in the store craftable freely. i wish more people would play and pay. this is one game that needs to last for dark sector and f2p sake.",104.7

"warframe is a really solid 4 player co-op game. its fast paced and a real good shootem up kinda style. loads of guns and mods make playing really exciting. the missions are fun and while they can be a little dull due to the extensive time it takes to level sometimes bringing new gear or tennos can change it up enough to make it thrilling again. 8 of 10. solid play great for friends who like playing co-op together and plenty of content to play through.",321.9
"while fun, the game has three free classes to pick in the begining. the other classes are avalible with by use real world money to buy in game points to obtain the other classes; with the most expensive ones being about 20$. wareframe plays exceptionaly well, and is just plain fun; especially with other players/your friends. however, because wareframe is free the majority of the gameplay is essentially pay-to-win due to the better items and other classes being available through the use of real world money. thats not to say that wareframe is a bad game, because its not, but this one aspect is enough to be a huge turn-off for some people.",3.0

"warframe: micro transactions that save your life. lets all be honest here, microtransactions are the bain of all gamers, and this game takes the absolute piss when it comes to them. you want to get that class? pay 10 and another 3.70 in individual packs to get it when it comes to gameplay however, this game pulls back some good boy points for the addictive hack n slash aspect of running around with a huge battle-axe swinging faster than the wheels on a ferrari going top speed. this game will take hours of your life away!!! when crafting a new weapon or a class this game takes the royal f-. low level weapons/ unsorted weapons: 12h popular weapons: 24h classes 3 motherf- days timers like that are not healthy for a game to survive, also it forces the player to think: i should really spend some money so i dont have to wait 3 days for this new class. despite my constant playing of the game, (getting a blazing +420 hours) this game disappoints me with build times. 6/10.",627.6
"brilliant game, so many features and amazing graphics and gameplay. this game has many signs that it can be bigger and better with these constant updates. cannot wait for the future!",433.7
"warframe, for all intensive purposes, should not be referred to as an open beta. aside from incorrect naming conventions, though, what we have here is an exceptionally addicting game that offers players a multitude of play-styles and game mechanics that keep things interesting. i love the concept, the art design, and the overall presentation of this game. i think it deserves a look, especially seeing as how it doesnt cost a single penny to pick up and play.",111.3
"this game is the most fun game i have played in a wile. i recomend this to any one who enjoys a saints row feel and a space shooter mix.",152.6
"overall a solid game, with fast paced elements and enough content for a long fun-filled experience. however, if i grinded as much irl as i did in-game, then i would probably have the bad-aids. gg 10/10 warframe saved the day.",378.8

"i have sunk far too much time into this game. far too much time. that being said, this game is quite fun, especially when you and your buddies discover how breakdance fighting works. nothing beats a good old fashioned breakdance fight tournement. lots of waiting and grind walls to be found here, but as far as fun goes, this game has it. i give it an 8.75 out of ten over, but for fun, i give it a tenno/ten. also, it is more likely than not the grineer.",854.6
"pros: +awesomely realistic graphics +physx support +the first 30 minutes contains grrrrrrreat fun +awesome gameplay cons: -starts getting pretty boring after 30 minutes -extremely hard in solo mode -hard to level up this game is highly reccomended if you like shooters. i played this game a lot, but a high shame its hard to level up. 8.5/10",3.4
"nice graphics for a free to play game, but the gameplay is dull. the story is pretty vague for the most part, the party function is almost broken, and i occasionally get tossed into missions that are halfway done. its not a horrible game, but its not great either.",1.4
"warfarm is far and away the worst offender when it comes to rng-based, unfun grinding, and the developers are probably some of the most incompetent in recent history. melee is shallow and nonviable, stealth (though for some reason encouraged) is not an option, there is an incredible lack of enemy variety, every single mission type feels the same, the grind-based progression in this game is some of the worst in any game i have ever played, the mod card system is unsustainable, and the developers are completely incapable of making the big changes that need to be made, opting instead to put a band-aid on the issue in the form of borderline-worthless mods. this game being free may seem attractive but i am warning you now that warframe is the most colossal waste of time you could ever try out. just save up some money and buy another game, or go look at other free-to-play titles out there. dont waste your time with this game, and please dont waste your money.",556.1

"wareframe is a damn good time, get three friends and play till your hearts content. i liked this game so much ive spent money on warframes and weapons in the real money market and i dont regret it, if anything its only made the game that much more fun. if you dont have the money to spend you can unlock almost anything just by playing enough. lots of cool feautres and a solid build.",79.7
"this game is epic. you can craft thing (almost everything) and chop people in half again and again and again. you can even make new characters.",518.1
"very good game, early on its mostly just go planet to planet and unlock them but once you get to late game your job becomes level up your gear, farm for items and go to the void. some people seem to be confused, warframe is in a loot game. its kinda like borderlands in that you level up (your gear, but also your mastery) and collect items. but in warframe you build more weapons and frames. should you play it? yes. should you play it expecting a linear campaign with a great story and character arches like they go from nice and fragile then to a total badass? no. if you enjoy starting with pretty much nothing and earning cooler and cooler gear and like the sense of achievement from getting that braton prime then yes. definitly play it.",541.1

"i have only played 2 hours, now my cousin is forcing me to come back to it. i dont think that you should get it, because the game is confusing, the weapons take forever to upgrade/create, and most of the things in the game you need to use a special item thats similar to clash of clans gems that you need to buy just so you can oh say get things now or buy special items.",3.2
"this game is amazing! i havent played it for long, but, i spent a good amount of time trying it out for the first time. may i say... bravo! jumping around in a space ninja suit is awesome... choose your playstyle! stealthy or plain rambo, this game allows either! smooth interface, incredible graphics, an immersive selection of mulitplayer and solo missions... and extremely satisfying mechanics! the only way you can be disappointed is if you dont have a good enough pc! this game is flat out amazing! the best part... all of this for free!",13.2
"warframe is the spiritual sequel of dark sector, and on this game we play as tenno, a race bound inside suits called warframes. little is known about your own past, and all you know is that a being or organization called lotus is trying to help you. you work as mercenarie bringing balance to the solar system, assassinating important targets from the rival factions and erradicating the technocyte viral infestation from space colonies. if you played dark sector you know what are the tenno. the gameplay is fast paced and the commands respond well, you can use a large variaty of weapons, from pistols to granade launchers and even larger selection of melee weapons. you can play as tanker running around killing and shooting everything or you can play as real ninja being sneaky. note that you must upgrade your weapons in order to survive the missions as you progress in the game. the game lacks end game content, but the des are updating the game and looking for fix it over time. the soundtrack is sometimes dark, giving a creepy feel to the game, and in other time it is exciting with all those naga drums. the graphics are gorgeous and it uses the nvidia physx. recomended, one of the best free to play game out there, 9.9/10.",729.6
"you need to spend about 15 to get the full experience but it is a good game! it needs to let people increase their inventory space through gameplay!",111.6

"bugs. bugs bugs bugs bugs, and more bugs. this game has more bugs than assasins creed unity and halo at launch. combined. nothing more frustrating that completing a mission objective and geting stuck in the floor on your way to the exit. this happens way too much, and there is no simple unstuck button. you either have to wait for enemies to kill you (if there are any around), which sometimes fixes it, or abort the mission losing all rewards. other than frequently getting stuck in the floor and other game breaking bugs, this game has potential to be fun. but sadly the developers seem more interested in new content (which is usually a good thing for most games) than fixing all the things that are currently broken with it.",115.1

"well, i have warframe for the ps4. i put about 100 hours into it, so i feel quite obligated to do a review on the game. i have to say it is probably one of most fun games i have played since, the borderlands, mw2 times. the game is sorta based off of space, where you play through missions in all planets. there is usually a boss or two at the last mission in a planet. the planets get harder and harder as you get around space. there is no real story, or maybe just not any effort into it. i could see a possible story. but of course it would be confusing. there probably is a story, but again its confusing. you can build weapons, buy them, customize your warframe. there are many warframes; excaliber, rhino, etc. trust me there is alot more than what i listed about the game. i honestly reccomend this game for all gamers whether what preference you have or not. a flawed, but a great mmo. flaws could be easily fixed with an update or two. so, therefore beyond the flaws. warframe is an amazing, truly beautiful, fun game to play especially with friends. very time-consuming. 9.5/10.",1.4

"warframe is a very fun game, while it is geared to be easier for people who pay for their warframes and weapons, you can get everything weapon and warframe without paying. using the crafting system allows you to get everything you need, although it will take longer. i havent payed any real money, but i play the game just as well as anybody who has.",73.3
"just another pay-to-win wrapped in a pretty package. the main character(s)/playstyle is a complete ripoff of the ninja cyborg characters from the metal gear solid series. the missions are mind-bogglingly repetitive, resulting in a continuous grindfest. and ultimately (as expected with almost every f2p out there), if you want the best and coolest gear, you have to pay. but youll keep on grinding - no escape from that.",8.5

"crazy fun. you have the ability to be a ninja in outer space...i mean wow! this game is great and i love the concept of all the mods being cards and how you can upgrade each one and you only have a certain amount of space to fit them in your inventory. be it your warframe, primary weapon, secondary weapon, or melee weapon. in order to build affinity you need to constantly change these items when the hit level 30 as once your warframe or weapon (no matter what type) hits 30 you no longer gain affinity for your account. it is important to gain affinity as this allows you to progress and unlock stronger items that are really required to get to the harder further planets. the game is free to play but be aware in order to unlock the extra weapons and warframes you need to buy slots for them and warframes are 20 plat each and weapons are 20 for 2 (only come by 2s ) i waited to get the random daily bonus to buy some platinum. i paid 25$ for 1000 which normally goes for 500. this game is well worth the money i put into it as i have played many hours on it and do recommend you do the same to give back to the great developers that made this magnificent game.",136.9

"the worst part about warframe: buying anything with paid credits is extremely expensive unless you roll a discount as a login reward. the second worst part: some bugs, but it is still in beta. third worst part: subpar interface. aside from that, pretty much no complaints. best visuals and gameplay out of any f2p thing i can think of, including some pretty badass sliding, wall running, somersaulting and other acrobatics, during which you can still freely shoot and melee. melee is elegantly handled with a single key instead of having to manually equip a weapon. putting weapons together the long way is just the right amount of work to actually be kind of satisfying instead of the anticipated unbearable grind. the universe and art direction are excellent; the tenno are badasses, and its practically impossible to not be awesome. even playing online with random guys isnt too awful; the average player barely even talks during a game, although you do run into some guys who are apparently hosting the game from a ti-83 in kenya. all in all, i mean, its a game about future space ninjas with guns and swords and superpowers, so im kind of predictably addicted. and the devteam seems like a pretty alright group of guys who enjoy adding new content.",110.4

"please understand (before skipping this review because i only have 7 hours logged) that i played this long before i even knew steam existed. it might as well be a seperate game from the one i started playing, but it has stayed just as good, if not improved, over the years. the graphics are nice even at the lowest settings, allowing the ability to play a nice looking game without lagging. the gameplay, while slightly overwhelming at first, is fluid and makes you feel like a boss. you can play however you want, from being sneaky and evading your foes, or rushing headstrong into a horde of grineer with your sword, so every player plays their own game. additionaly, every warframe and weapon changes that style. for example, i main limbo on my steam, who differs greatly from my old excalibur. instead of sword skills, limbo can manipulate the void to his will and transport his friends, foes, and even himself into the rift between the void and reality. every single warframe has awesome abilities like that. the customization is awesome, and once you have a clan it gets that much better. this game is a masterpiece. a blend of assassins creed, dark souls, kotor, halo, destiny, and god knows what else. its free, go give it a shot. you will love it.",7.4
"i would recommend this game to people who are used to the diablo style of grinding, as well as have a group of friends to play along with. this game can get very tiresome fast unless you form a clan or join one and do missions with your clan mates. pvp is also not were it should be, it has a lot of balancing to do but has a ton of potential.",33.5

"its a grindfest yes, but it is rewarding. all upgrades make you feel badass along with the ability to craft every item in the game (except a few things) it keeps you going back to old levels to get more materials to build better stuff. the game is very well balanced as well. it dosnt take time to reach a max rank on a suit or warframe so catching up to your friends who play is not very hard. once you finished maxing out a warfram you cna craft a different warframe and try the game with a different set of special moves and tactics. storyline is alright, nothing too mind blowing but its styled nice and it makes since. graphically the game is good. nothing groundbreaking but i woudlnt say lack luster. its shiny and fluid. overall i give it a solid 7.5/10 worth playing, its free-to-play so pick it up and at least give it a try",163.4

"like ninjas with guns? well this is ninjas with guns in space! the game is based entirely on how overpowered you can get, whether you augment your warframe, modify and max out your weapons, or go ballistic with your melee of choice. gameplay is varying on how you wish to play and there are dozens of warframes for them. however, its good to keep in mind that you may find yourself doing a lot of grinding and looting for the rarer materials to build said warframes. maps can get repetitive, but helps you remember where loot can be found. you either have to go through a lot of grinding to get materials and credits to forge new gear, with can get boring when playing alone. biggest issue, though, is the drastic difficulty curve. one moment, youre dominating every grineer, corpus, and infested you come across. next thing you know, youre flattened by the next planets enemies. id recommend this game, but definitely if you have someone to play with. relying on matchmaking usually ends up with total strangers much stronger than you, noobs who dont know what to do so you constantly have to revive them, or soloing witht the chance of losing all your revives. basically, i recommend you make some friends or meet your ends.",415.9

"checking for new updates simulator 2015. would update again.",17.3
"best game multiplayer and solo game .... yes good game i louve it..",7.1
"possibly one of the greatest games i have ever played. this is also the only game on steam which i have over 200 hours of game time. warframe plays great and feels rewarding. this game is a legend and deserves the respect and support that it has. if you like being the ultamite space death machine, play this game.",1245.0
"ive been playing warframe for about two months, and from the first time i played it, i knew it would be a game id play for a long while. its game play overall reminisces of monster hunter, so if youre familiar with that game, youll more than likely enjoy this one. of course, their similarities end there. this is a game of skill. it is set in some alternate universe, and, in short, you go around, killing things foreseen as evil and you dont really know why, just that you must at any cost. in your travels, you collect materials and, in turn, use them to create weapons, as well as other warframes. tread lightly and slowly, because there is not an end-game to this one yet. all you have is the pvp, and that doesnt quite do it for a good number of the players. the only thing you can do right now is become a perfectionst and compete for clan rights, but it is still (technically) in early-access, so we can always look forward for new content. all in all, id have to say give it a try. its free, you can dump time into it, and the community is great overall.",496.6
"its funny but one round of game makes you too tired",4.8
"after playing warframe for 1000 hours ill say it definetely was a blast and still is. it never ceases to fail me that it always made me and my friends feel like were badasses. one shotting things and wiping rooms in mere seconds made me feel like a god almost. when ever it came to the hard stuff it was a bunch a teamwork and skill to output such great results whether it be survival or defense missions. although this game is not perfect with its few glitches and grindfests (freaking rng >_<), i feel it has come along way and from its beta till now. this game is about the journey not the quest (sometimes :3).",1081.8
"really odd game for me even thats really nice co-op, the system and the items abit hard i will give it a pass because you have alot of missons/chars!",3.1
"you get to be a sci-fi sword wielding agile jedi ninja..... its all my sexual fantasys at once + the game looks amazing",165.7
"the game is good but its ing  for me why the game crashes when i attack or left click it just straight away crashes last time i played it about last year it doesnt crash thanks to the new update the game just got a pain in the .",17.4
"tenno-dono, the galaxy is calling for you. the blade is starving for the blood of your enemies =)",592.1
"not a bad shooter but bad level / upgrade. play the game and youll see.",3.5
"love the story behinde the game but its just to little of it in-game but still a lot of fun",448.1
"the fact that i have put more hours into this game in 2 weeks than i have in any other game i have downloaded should be enough said.",42.1
"so good game. might be hard to start playing,but when you understand the modding n stuff its going to be awesome.",819.1
"really good game worth the time for the beginners i enjoyed this game for around three weeks before getting bored of it",204.9
"you get to play as space ninjas for this game. freaking. space. ninjas.",372.6
"space ninjas? yes please, and not as grindy as other free-to-plays.",678.6
"i love this game it is awesome and great!! the first few missions are a bit tedious though. and the game is a bit confusing at times. but you should get used to it. have fun in warframe. ill be waiting. lol",1.7
"is crap at letting you sign up and play and when first attempt to sign in fails will block your ip address...",0.1
"the game is great for a free to play game, with high graphics and high-quality gameplay. but the main flaw in this game is that it requires alot of farming or cashing in order to be able to complete high-tier missions such as the tier 4 void survival. but the gameplay makes it worth playing.",482.4
"this game is really good. for a small company to keep tabs on their game like you guys have is amazing!!! keep up the good work and i expect more greatness out of this developer.",5.0
"basically a farming simulator, but, fast paced and with quests,lore,crafting,pets,future pvp and all that in beta. good time burner and makes you feel that you achieved something everytime you play it, even if you just leveled one of you weapons.",32.6
"buggy, grindy an overall terrible. i wish i could stop playing this 10/10",156.5
"this game is alright but the cost of  is extremely ing gay",23.6
"for an fps, this really has a neat story to it. i like the action, even plays well on a laptop. (although the default video settings were way to high; whatever happened to autodetect?) for free, this really is quite good - so far i dont get that gimme money, you stupid little monkeys! vibe as seen in so many free android/ios games where that is rampant. smooth action and highly detailed models. ton of customizations (when purchased or unlocked). * <2 hr in-game so far",4.1
"this game sucked up all of my time, and is pretty much the defining game of my college experience. anytime i play a game, i play warframe. super addicting, but in a good way. time is definitely money in this game, and often the majority of your time is spent in crafting sweet new weapons and warframes. updates are constant, with new content being released often. if you love fast-paced ninjas sprinting around with superpowers shooting and slashing everything in their path, this games for you.",170.5
"play this game if you have absolutley nothing else to play. the only plantet anyone plays on is earth and(for me anyways) it takes 20 min. to connect to a game.20 min! overall not worth it.",232.6
"this is a very good game, though it wont recongise my consle controler, its still a very good and well desined game.",217.1
"f2p done right, is a bit grindy but as you can tell from the time played there is plenty to do",1180.3
"this game is easily worth your money, so it at least deserves your time.",82.0
"this game doesnt appeal in the start. buttttt, as you slowly understand more about the game, you start to get really into it",293.9
"i have put in nearly 200 hours and still counting. i quite fancy this game. the different environments and classes of enemies bring some interesting variety to the table. all the maps are randomly generated so farming for those materials to build weapons or new frames isnt quite as tedious. equippable mods can make you that super serious player to kick some bum or that silly player that shoots exploding arrows which just might kill you too. this game is still in beta so things are constantly changing! whichever your play style, i believe that there is a little bit for most everyone to enjoy this game. not enjoying it? try playing with friends! :) 9/10",185.5
"space ninjas .... do you really need another reason?",194.4
"i find this game to be a solid alright its a time sink (majorly), it takes around 2-3 days to make a new warframe(new class) after collecting all the pieces. unless you pay for the warframe then you get it automatically, you may like this game if you like leveling up, playing the same maps which may get repetitive, farming. i give this game a 7/10, it is a time sink but it can get highly repetitive.",70.0
"great f2p that u can be better than another just playing , without barriers like another games that if u use cash u could be a god. great graphics and sounds , fast commands , nice customization , great variety of weapons . ive played since the beta and the bugs almost dont exist anymore , each update with news and fix for the game that make it fantastic. the most perfect f2p ever .",105.0
"it was fun but the missions just repeat over and over just with slightly different objectives. a lot of customization.",4.2
