"game is amazing!! i just wish the story was a bit more fulfilling than just go to a  ton of little caves, visit a club full of santas on top of a mountain and breath on dragons until they die. i bet gaben could do better <3",2.6
"this has been one of my favorite games of all time, the depth of exploration and the game play have been unmatched by anything else i have played.",265.7
"i had waited for about 4 years for this game to lower the prices and i saw he special for 20$ i was amazed.the gameplay is amazing gamemaking at its best 100000/10 i would recommend this to all best game cant wait for the next",146.6
"ing awesome. and one big time sink. get ready to give up your life. even the bugs are entertaining.",170.4
"of all the games that i have ever played, this is by far the best. even two years after release, the graphics still hold their own, and the gameplay is fantastic. the way that the game lets you do what you want, when you want is just awesome. it is probably pretty hard to make a game of this size and scope and for it to acually be a sucess. the team at bethesda is by far my favorite gaming studio, and they deserve all the praise that they get for this game. the dlc is really well done to, and if you were thinking about thorwing some money down for it, you wont be dissapointed. but if you were sceptical for the game, dont be. the game is worth every single penny, and is just fantastic. a perfect score in my opinon. just fantasic.",253.9
"just getting started but love it already! this game is amazing and has incredible re-playability.",0.6
"i have bought anthology and elders scroll online.the sound on all these games is bad and getting help to know how to fix it is imposible. i love skyrim and would play it forever if it functioned right. would even be willing to buy other games if i thought someone cared about customer satisfaction. but i will probable uninstall these products and never buy anything with bethesda on it. i hope the get it right with other customers.",285.5
"this game is awesome!everyone can find something special in the world of skyrim. you want to be a fearsome warrior, slashing and smashing through hordes of enemies? you got it! you want stealth? just do it! amazingly beautiful open world. crafting, hunting, mining, etc. etc. must have!",49.9
"one of the best games ive ever played. skyrim has a ton of things to do too",74.6
"i am a big fan of this type of game. plundering dungeons, killing enemies, selling loot all in the search of epic items and gear. character customisation alters the way the game is played as different npc react differently to certain races/sexes. some of the side quests are extremely long and the pay off is nowhere near adequate. the main story is long enough to ensure you can max out your characters skill level, and the oponents level with you so you always find a challenge. i recommend this game to anyone who is ditching wow and looking for something similar.",57.1
"favorite game ever. if you dont want it to end it will oblige giving even the strongest dovakin more and more challenges to overcome.",432.8
"great game with so much replayablity and the mod support is awesome",35.2
"what other game on steam lets you fight giant, flying, fire-breathing macho man randy savage as a topless anime babe?",43.9
"awesome game one of the most fun ive played, also it is chalenging i know i spelled that wrong but ime to lazy to research it. when you first enter this spectacular rpg you think i am going to hav so much fun playing this game and your right,it is over all the best game ive played, ps you realy haf to pay atenchen to diolect. i ame sory for miss spelled words.",27.0
"simply the best game ive ever played, beautiful massive enviroment lots of customising simply amazing im 30 hours in and feel like there is so much more left to do and explore this is a must have rpg!",34.0
"a very good game, much good ,such buy ,so fun, would recommend this to people who like role playing games and massive maps to roam through but make sure your computer can run it.",47.4
"hundreds of hours of fun to be had, especially with the multitude of amazing community mods.",57.1
"its almost as good as new vegas, which is saying a lot. buy this game!",133.5
"in one word great awesome experience even for not rpg fan.perfect quests(mostly interesting,even the side quests,no repetitive levels,a beautiful dungeons hide all around the world)story is not narrow,world is massive and truly open to your way to play...and u really can play any style u want and if it not suits you,one can always change ur mind and start train different skills,even in the middle of your journey. ###caution warning## you will sink a lots of hours into this gem",84.9
"excellent sandbox rpg, worthy of spending many hours in. nice crafting system, except it doesnt have spell making, which is kinda sad, overall good fighting, and a multitude of mods to tweak the game, or pretty much make it something completelly different altogether.",261.6
"amazing graphics, story, and voice acting. you can immerse yourself in the wonders of the elder scrolls for hours at a time! a must buy for every fantasy and fp gamers. it combines fighting with puzzles, riddles, luck, and strategy for one heck of a ride. buy it now!",102.2
"i really wanted to love skyrim. but i couldnt. we were promised a living, breathing world with an epic story and millions of quests to fulfill. however, what i feel skyrim amounts to is a dull, samey experience. no rpg elements, low enemy and equipment diversity and a lackluster story make skyrim boring and see-through. i can see where an amazing game may have been birthed from what exists, but it never happened. stick to oblivion and the fallout series. avoid skyrim if you enjoy rpgs. however, if you like action games, this ones for you.",63.8
"skyrim is an rpg game with an big open world and thousands possibilities to make. its also ultimately modable which make this game pure gold. however all you need to know about this game: 1. skyrim is never ending game and i been playin it since it came out, later i activated it on steam. with mods installed you will have ultimate game and hours of fun. 2.you can play skyrim however you want there is lot of ways for your playstyle. increase skills which suits you the best! 3. no matter how badass you look do not try kill giants on low level. trust me! it could ruin your self-esteem.. 4. dont kill a frickin chicken unless you want rot in jail or get killed by angry people. with killing emperor you shouldnt have to much problems. 5. skyrim is highly addictive game which will make your day disappear like your money in a wallet so be careful try maintain communication with your family,friends and so on. i highly recommend this game 10/10",311.7
"one of the best games ever. with the addons from the workshop its even better.",378.3
"nowadays, theres no reason not to get this game. a playthrough will last you for about 100 hours, which is really good considering its a 15 game (and getting it for -75% is rather easy if youre patient). skyrim is a good game. i wouldnt say its great due to its mediocre combat, mediocre physics and lack of feeling of progression at times. but its enjoyable nonetheless. i feel like the games overrated, but its certainly not bad.",112.2
"this game is not worth all the buzz, is overrated, and generally a waste of money. 3/10",2.9
"absolutely brilliant game, but 9/10 is suited for the weapon animations in 1st person are pretty much opisite of 3rd. this is the best open world game youll find from bethesda, with 50 hours worth of side missions that go along with the 10 hour long story line and a nother 5000 hours+ from the add-ons people make, this game will astound you with beautifull graphics, fully customisable characters, choices in main events, this game brings the full perspective of what you would expect in a 3rd century-ish game. join the storm cloaks or the imperial legion in the war for tamriel, bring chaos to your enemys with spell- casting madness and blade-wielding brutallity. delve into caves to fight of bears, spiders, bugs and rake in the loot or work at the smith for some money. buy a house with the home-sweet-home hearthfire dlc, adopt children, build your own house next to a lake, live life like you want it, or... become a vampire or fight against them in the dawn guard dlc, go on a nother 10 hour dlc, with unexpected happenings and a new weapon aswell as some new attire, delve deep to the void in this amaizing story or... ride dragons in the dragon bord dlc or infact get a pet bear, what more could you want. with so much fun in this game, everyone should have it. all you should remember is, dont get shot with a arrow in the knee...",237.6
"amazing. and so much better on pc than it ever was on a console.",22.3
"this game is by far my most-played on steam. the variability and replayability is insane. this is the best game going, until the next elder scrolls game is released, anyway.",336.0
"best modding experience out there, even if youre new to it its simple. beautiful game.",17.6
"one game is good enough for me,9.5/10 for skyrim like this game",41.8
"its like a buffet dinner; sure, theres mountains of food to eat, but everything just has the same bland processed food taste albeit with a nordic tinge. -michael raston even with any number of dlcs/mods you may wish to impose upon the game. trust me ive tried.",534.2
"played offline with requiem. mods are great. 10/10. definitely better than the ps3 version.",26.5
"with tons of mod this game make infinite fun you can play and look at sky, why no bird there? search mod and magical, thousand bird fly, need more fish? need more tree? need sexy girls? need ferrari? you can find it, trust me.. this game make sky only the limits.",27.7
"skyrim is second only to oblivion, and thats only because of one aspect that will probably surpass it at some time. the mods for skyrim are good, some are even fairly amazing and world making, but its still nothing compared to the amount of mods and the quality of mods for oblivion. skyrim is overall amazing, save for the combat (though that can be modded to a degree) and the main story lacking in any real substance besides kill x to make sure world doesnt end. i got my moneys worth out of it, especially with the dlc (my favorite being dawnguard). 7.5/10, would buy and play again.",390.6
"+ big location + so many quests + living world + diversity of weapons + magic + enemies + characters (includes your herp creation) + and items + crafting + level upgrades - awful fighting gameplay - low ip intelligence makes game too easy - main campaign is too boring to complete - some quests are same - same-sexual marriage? (was it too hard to add a line if hero is male; gendalph is male; => dont show marry?) - low allies ip. dies often in dragon battle. - wastes too much life time",134.4
"this game is addicting as it is emersive. i think i spelled emersive wrong, but whatever. the game has thousands of mods, many, many quests, and long loading screens. so unless you have a really good desktop, good luck entertaining yourself while waiting. i rate the game 9/10 for fun, addicting and emersive enviroment, but also has long loading screens and a bit of bugs and glitches.",33.9
"i can totally lose myself in this game. however after a while it get a bit predictable and i wish that it would have a better controller support. still i absolutely love this game and i hope that the next installment is just as good",64.3
"beatiful, moddable, great mods available, decent main quest, plenty of decent side quests, pretty cool. plenty choice of crafting items, smithing and magic. lack of classes is a break still from the tradtional, but you can orient your character twords any playstyle you wish, it is completely open . did i mention beautiful? plenty of great scenic views, visual effects. classic fantasy monsters, undead skeletons, zombies, vampires, werewolfs, and of course dragons(which are done fairly well with ai movement and behavior)and many more. did i mention it looks beautiful?",31.2
"although many people say the elder scroll campaign was dull and entertaining, i disagree highly. there is high amounts of freedom toward the freedoms you have to explore and make of this game what you want, escpecially on pc. now pc, dont get to excited, the feeling i have towards xbox is more natural then a keyboard and mouse, which pc will never capture. anyway, the steam workshop allows for a greater amount of fun to be added to your gaming experience, also to challenge those who think this game is too easy (go ahead and try to kill a dragon on expert, youll die one hit guaranteed). so, do i recommend skyrim? hell yeah. also, whos excited for elder scrolls 6? multiplayer!!!!!!!!!",91.4
"this game is the best. i just got it and everything is beautiful. a obious 10/10",43.6
"amazing game. soo much to do. well worth the money.",103.9
"best game ever!!!! :d i could play this for several hours without stop! (as a matter of fact i already did! :p )",329.1
"if someone gave me apples, and another person gave me oranges, i would get pissed off because neither of them gave my a copy of skyrim, which is pretty much the greatest game ever made. amazing open world. virtually limitless quests. deep lore and careful detail. crafting. combat. thieving. duel wielding. and dragons!?!?! yes, yes dragons. the enormous array of mods also make this like buying an entire additional game for the price of one. so yeah, more awesome happening right there. buy it. buy it now. or wait. for a steam sale. cuz then its only 5 dollars. thats just cray right there. skyrim belongs to the nords!",5.0
"the game was already excellent to start with, but the addition of mods make it superb. im a longtime player of the elder scrolls and i think this has been the best entry up there with morrowind.",1333.7
"this is one of the best rpgs ever created and one of the best in its series(the elder scrolls) alokng with its predecessor, oblivion.this game will be loved by both action and rpg fans since it combines elements from these 2 game genres in a unique way...the only drawback i can find in this game is its numerous bugs which is a normal thing taking its humongous world and environment into account...so stop what you are doing and go buy this piece of art!! peace!",37.9
"was gonna talk to a dude, steals a cup instead and gets a bounty of 40 coins and the whole town tries to kill me 11/10 -ign",151.9
"after years of mate telling me to get this game i finally gave in and got it and not regretted it ok its a bethesda game which means its full of bugs but thanks to the modding community most bugs can be fixed and evan add a little extra to the game i highlly recommend if your in to rpgs get this game pros good storyline nice gameplay open world excellent modding community cons its a bethesda game (meaning buggy but thankls to the modding community i can get pasted that) thanks modding community i love you",53.6
"this is a great game with weeks of gameplay. it is definitely a game i recommend",32.3
"worth it, if only for the epic mods. civil war story is subpar and main storyline, while epic, was a bit too short. then again, dlc has promise.",234.0
"a dragon got stuck in a tree while trying to eat me. 10/10 thank you tree.",7.9
"10/10 i think this game is the best rpg open world game in the world and there is endless mods to the game so you can change it completely",60.8
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",148.5
"the best open world game with a amazing story. you play as dragonborn (dovakinn) the last dragonslayer, your mission is to stop/slay aldin the dragon god of time. stop him from raising his army of dead dragons and plus save skyrim from the civil war that rages throught skyrim (optinal)(deals with the main quest a little). choose a side of muitiply factions that are in skyrim or if you dont want to do any of that you can mod the living crap out of it. your choice.",56.5
"a very good game for people who enjoy rpgs that require skill and nerve to deal with constant world events.",165.5
"its skyrim. why wouldnt you get it?!? you can make it into whatever game you want with mods. the only reason not to get it is if you do not have some free time to spend in tamriel, cause you will be there a while.",434.1
"spent over 100 hours playing, over 150 modding, 5 stars.",165.6
"combat is figuratively jerking off two extra long shlongs while you have the occaisional whip shlong, magic keeps the game fun for a long while, making people fly 100m away or shocking them until they start making glitchy creepy movements is always hilarious. graphics, they are nice, just could be a lot better. the perk of playing skyrim on pc, you can mod all the problems good bye. even combat, extra quests, bigger  all the work!",204.8
"this game set the standard of any rpg i have played since. bethesda has done an amazing job.",513.1
"awesome chapter to the elder scroll series. they just keep getting better!",484.7
"its only good with millions of mods :d otherwise its lackluster. ~",323.8
"pickpocketed a guy of all his clothes and left him standing there naked... 11/10",23.5
"this is a very good adventure game, it is good for almost any fan of nintendos the legend of zelda series! very good, go buy now!",269.6
"this game is too fun but i need more i completed it in less than a summer i completed dawnguard in three days gimme more",454.4
"an awesome open world where you do whatever the hell you want. you can do the main quest, do sidequests, or heck, do no quests at all and just kill loads of bandits and forsworn! the characters are flexible: you are not restricted to a specific playstyle as your characters skills level up as you use them. loads of content, and if you get the dlc, loads more content! overall, fastastic game. when this game is on sale, it is definitely worth your money!",101.3
"this game is so cool.the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is interesting. the details is so gorgeous. dragons flying in the air and wolfs attack you.....so fantastic. you can hunt rabbits, deers and who knows what else. i can tell..... the game is worth the money :)",92.1
"its a old game, and its image quality is not the best(without dlc), but i still love it.",33.5
"steam workshop makes it a millon times better, console commands make it possible to work around game breaking bugs, and its just better overall",78.4
"its good but most of the mods are terrible garbage. too much garbage loot in these games too",27.4
"better in pc than xbox i would defiantly recommend this game",79.9
"oh, there once was a hero named ragnar the red who came riding to whiterun from old rorikstead.........",203.5
"the game will not allow me to install after the downloads are complete. i have already resarted steam, my computer and deleted the local content within my computer. i have tried to contact sykrim support and steam support but to no evail they refuse to respond. if anyone has any advice please write back to me.",233.3
"has a lot of bugs, but they come to be warm and memorable quirks to the game. the graphics can be amazing or pretty garbage depending on what kind of system you run...the graphics were coded inefficiently so it takes quite a tank to get up to the real beauty skyrim has to offer. the modding community is amazing and keeps this game thriving with new ideas, new adventures, and new mechanics that you probably wouldnt have even imagined. but they can be really great and fun to just explore. all in all, skyrim is an awesome game. you might play it for just a little while, or for an insanely long time as i have, but i can guarantee that no matter how much you decide to put into skyrim it will be a memorable and most likely enjoyable experience.",572.0
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is definitely one of the greater games on the steam market. in skyrim, your character is not restricted to certain items or abilities (except the abilities that come with your characters race). if you want to buy the game i would suggest buying legendary edition because of its extra hours of gameplay. and, if you dont like the game the way it is, you can find a wide array of mods you might enjoy.",231.4
"great base game but the dlc is less bang for more bucks.",476.6
"amazing!!! i recommend this to anyone who likes a relaxing, open world rpg game !!!!!!!",12.0
"i shot a bear in the eye one time, and this game let me do it!",108.5
"since i got this game ive played it quite a lot, and i must say i still enjoy playing it a bit, every now and then ... but only a bit of play at a time :p it is one of the best games ive played so far, and its fantastic modding community keeps it alive and breathing. ive even made a mod myself! :) though it has its flaws (the so-called elder scrolls bugs, or ... whatever it is they call it :p) i highly recommend everyone to try it out!",727.5
"great game, might be a bit old but with mods its still looks amazing. ive played this on ps3, xbox and pc and its so much better on pc by far.",200.4
"i have been a big fan of all the elder scrolls games. i started with morrowind, and have quite a few playthroughs. the amount of content even without mods and dlc is amazing. skyrim has the best combat system of them all. you could easily spend 300+ hours just doing all the side quest and exploring. the dlc for this game is somewhat lacking compared to shivering isles, but worth it if you are a fan. do yourself a favor and at least download the official high texture pack. overall one of the best rpgs i have ever played.",424.9
"okay. listen, todd howard. you cant make maihk the liar tell the truth. you cant. how the  can you. i dont even. everything is ruined. what. why. i dont. what. todd, i swear to god you will not be able to walk straight, after i  you with a shotgun sideways. what. no. you ing . you cant even have the. i dont even want to play this game and already ive spent 300+ hours on it. not only have you spent my social life, now maihk doesnt lie. i hope you own a lot of miracle grow, because your  is grass!!! edit: three epic, glorious expansions, three epic, glorious years. you still havent fixed this problem. 400 hours, todd. 400 god damn hours.",380.2
"if you love rpgs. this is a must have. if you hate rpgs. this is a must have.",330.2
"hands down one of the most, if not the most, immersive, grand scale, adventure, you can find while playing a video game. and with the many mod add-ons, you can make your game as lifelike or silly as you like - depending on your tastes. certaintly one of the greatest adventure games in gaming history.",198.5
"i started playing this game and in the process forgot that life outside of this game existed. once i remembered, i shrugged it off and went back to killing dragons. 5 sweet rolls out of 5, great game, go play it.",180.7
"theres not a lot to say about skyrim that proper reviews havent already thoroughly covered. this is a fantastic game, with beautiful graphics, countless gameplay options, plot choices and a decent number of subquests and subplots to keep things interesting even after completing the main quest line. if you enjoy deep and detailed epic fantasy role playing, this is the game for you. if you are more of a casual gamer, this might seem a bit complex and fidgety - there are so many things to do and so many ways to do them, it can often feel very broad and overwhelming. on the whole, it was an amazing experience to behold and truly allows you to explore the ingame world your own way.",49.0
"best open-world videogame ever made ! full of great mods.",65.0
"ive played this game for 160 hours, with multiple starts, but never finished the main story. i always get distracted by a side quest or on a mission to level up alchemy or enchanting or something. i think that this winter i will make a special effort to complete the main story, ill just start a new character and get right to it, no distractions .... oooh hearthfire dlc...",170.8
"i have played skyrim on every system the ps3, xbox 360, and now the pc and i have to say that the consoles dont even come close to the preformance of the pc and i dont even have the best computer. so to all those wondering if you should buy skyrim on the pc or on the consoles id would tell you if your computer meets the minimum requirements defiantly buy it for the pc, if your computer doesnt and you cant upgrade your computer then get it on the xbox 360 because the ps3 is the worst of all!!!",0.7
"if you like sandbox crpgs, you definitely should give skyrim a chance. ive played all elder scroll games and skyrim is definitely my favorite. while the main story may not as great as in some other games, the huge world and the vast number of quests make more than up for it.",142.9
"oh, my, freaking, god, best game 10/10 mlg 420 blaze it game of the year bit too late to do the ratin though ;) seriously though buy it.",37.6
"well, honestly, amazing rpg bethesda never fails at making a game. love em or hate em, its true.",267.3
"this game is the best game i have ever played. mods or no mods its the best!",248.4
"ok, for those of you who have already played past elder scrolls series games, ive only one thing to say: buy it! for the rest of you who havent, read on: skyrim is the 5th installment in the elder scrolls series by bethesda. its set in the frozen north of tamriel (the name of the continent) and you start as a prisoner of the empire on your way for execution. events will quickly put you in the story and as it turns out you have a special connection to the dragons, who have recently made their appearance again. graphics are very good and overall the game is awesome and very very very flexible to mod. it can get very immersive and you wont get up from the pc for many hours! totally recommended for rpg maniacs out there.",690.5
"its a great simple fun to play game, be careful. you will get addicted!!",52.4
"skyrim is a lovely game for anybody who seeks an adventure and an action-packed game! i love how i can literally go anywhere and even after playing this game for about a year, im still learning new things. plus i think this game is even more amazing because i killed heimsker, the obnoxious talos worshipper in whiterun. though i just really wish i can kill braith, the little brat in whiterun, with my bare hoofs.",150.6
"super fun. youll play for /many/ hours before you ever get bored of this game.",25.4
"love it. steam workshop makes it better and more play time",370.4
"more than a perfect game for spend hours and hours and nver get tired and never runout of things to do and explore awesome game! totally recomended",77.1
"skryrim is an immersive world of adventure. what better way is there to relex at the end of a long day, then to incenerate your foes?",211.6
"goty. need i say more? no, i dont. just get this game, its on sale every 4 minutes and always under 10 euros. if you dont own skyrim, you are a fool.",104.5
"i cant understand how people wouldnt want to play this game. i suppose everyone has their own tastes, but if you dont like some of the quests, or the quality of graphics, go to steamworkshop! they have grass, water, snow, ember, fire and general foliage improvements, as well as dozens of quests and new areas, items and followers. the game in itself is stunning, and i should really play it more often. edit- hahahahahaha its all i play",409.3
"really fun to play, one of the best games available. the only downside is that the enemies level matches our level, so we could get in a situation where the game is impossible to beat. for example, a lvl 40 pure wizard is really powerful, but if you then level up melee or some other skills, your magic abilities are not more powerful, but the enemies are harder to beat.",97.3
"a nice game with good graphics that sucks you into the big world of skyrim. really open you can have multiple experinces help the stomcloacks rebel to gain skyrims independce or help the impirals take stormcloaks so skyrim will join the empire. few bugs and glicths but much fun to be had. i do find it odd nobody complains if i strip. i give it 9-9.5/10 play it",258.4
"game of generation contender or clear cut champion?",47.2
"an amazing open world game with much to offer and endless amounts of entertainment.",49.5
"immense in scale and the community/modding scene makes this the best elder scrolls to date.",172.2
"i think this game is pretty great.theres just so much to do in it and your never out of things to do.",124.8
"a tale of epic proportions matched only by its predecossors. skyrim is a game of grapic quality and clarity that really makes you feel that you are in the world of the elder scrolls. its vastly improved combat and engaging chat options combined with its detailed characters and astonishing beasts allow you to delve into a world of endless possiblities. it is a game that transcends into reality through its detail and delivers perfection on what it promises.",24.2
"this game has me addicted. have been playing for an age but doesnt get boring at all.",458.9
"for those of you who believe this game is nothing but oblivion 2.0, you can turn around now and go pound sand. still here? good. skyrim is not an expansion or rehash, it is not a waste of time and money, and it can not be missed for any reason.",1131.6
"a superb title, in spite of the sometimes moronic ai (its easy to overcome). massive world to explore, beasts to slay, and bodies to loot! truly, a must-have for every fan and newcomer. oh, and theres a plethora of astounding mods for better graphical fidelity, quests, and items. even just the vanilla version is worth the purchase!",415.3
"awesome game with a good story, wonderfull landscapes and epics fights. there are enough things to do to never get borred of this game -150h played, still not done (130 before purshasing on steam)- . if you have to do some choices in this game that will influence the way pnc sees you, you may also choose between your grades and this game. good luck on the land of skyrim !",33.1
"if you have not heard of this game, i dont know what to tell you.... simply amazing graphics and gameplay. bethesda shows why they are one of the best, yet again.94 on the meta, and i cant disagree. this is what all rpg games strive for.",75.9
"i had been hyped for this game, ever since it had been announced. i had enjoyed playing through oblivion on ps3, and morrowind on my old pc, the elder scrolls series had earned itself a special place in my heart, as one of my favourite western rpg series. after picking the game up, shortly after its release, on pc, i eagerly put the game disc in, intent on playing what would inevitably me a masterpiece. it didnt work. but many days later, i input the registry code into steam, to play it. i had waited forever for this game, and when i at first entered the world, one thing would be forever clear. it ing suck",519.2
"i wish the skill system was more like oblivion, but. whatever. i became bored of this game very quickly on console. however im still having fun with it on pc do to modability, which made it so i can have the oblivion/morrowind system through mods. if you can, get this on pc, not console.",105.8
"a breath-taking experience but slightly dumbed down a litle from its predecessor; oblivion, mainly for casual gamers.",67.6
"i didnt mod anything but my character - source = no one i dont really like this.",6.9
"buy the game for the playthrough and keep it for the mods!",122.8
"single player: 9/10 long campaign with a lot of side quests and very realisitc multiplayer: n/a no multiplayer experience graphics: 9/10 very visualy apealing community: 8/10 maps and mods at our disposal",49.1

"skyrim was my first rpg that ive ever played, its very special to me. ive never had a gaming experiance quite like the elder scrolls. the freedom, world, and lore just cant be matched by any other game. that, tied in with the character building and the countless numbers of quests make it a true master piece of gameing. ive spent many hours on this game and its great counterparts (morrowind, and oblivion). i hope to see at least one more tes title come out this decade. the tes community has grown in the past few years so if you think something needs to be added to the game chances are their are mods to enhance it. the elder scrolls fanchise is beloved and remarked as one of the greatest games ever. so if you havent played skyrim, at least try it out. if you have played, try morrowind, and oblivion. and if youve done that too, try similar titils like the fallout franchise.",188.5
"oblivion was the personifcation of an rpg. skyrim takes the crown of undisputed rpg heavyweight for the next few years. unsuprassed excellence, replayability and near perfection with endless plethora of mods to hone and tweak your game. better or equal to dark souls: prepare to die edition until tes vi arrives...",563.7

"hands down one of the best games i have ever played. the world has a lot of gorgeous locations and jaw dropping scenes for first time players, especially for those who love to explore. the game is large in scope and extremely immersive. on the rpg side of things, it isnt as deep as say morrowind or oblivion, but that can easily be remedied with any number of the fantastic overhaul mods u can find on the nexus or steam workshop. to add onto that, mods are a wonderful thing for this game. vanilla itself is enough to warrant a purchase from any real gamer, but sheer diversity and depths of mods that currently exist definitely add a whole new dimension to this game and the replayability is endless.",656.3
"one of the best games in the world. skyrim, with its huge modding community will bring you almost anything from a magical, medieval world. my gaming hours says it all, you will spend much time in skyrim. keep in mind that mods have made me play this game for so long (5 playthroughs) but modding the game comes at a price. you will have to read yourself into the modding world, often learning the hard way the mistakes you have done by corrupting your save. therefore remember to only install quality mods that have been reviewed by others. tips: never remove a mod. it may be hard, but mods get baked into your savegame, eventually crashing it. this applies to script-based mods. textures are fine. have fun!",901.9

"alright i dont like theese types of fantasy games that often, but hot damn is this one fun. i played the earlier games in the series and hated them, i am so happy that i decided to give it another chance. the rpg elements are amazing, especially the leveling system, i honestly cant say there is any better leveling system. if you dont use something in the game you cant expect it to be easier to perform, simple as that.",41.2

"one of the best games money can buy. its one of the biggest worlds filled with quests, side-quests, and random npcs. and dont even get me started on the modding community which really doubles if not, triple what the game is all about: beautifull graphics, deep world, great number of enemies and dragons.",15.3
"i found this to be a dissapointing fps as the gunplay was awefull i realy think that bethesda should work harder as an rts like this should deserve better, that being said it did not have a supporting franchise/ previous games to assist its release in all i would give it a /1000. would recomend it to that guy that works in the supermarket!",124.9
"a worthy successor to the elder scrolls iv, my all-time favorite game, while some things have been greatly simplified (enchanting/magic) the game as a whole stands as the most immersive rpg i have ever been fortunate enough to play in. the story is fantastic, and all the guilds are well developed, even if they sometimes get a bit predictable. surprise, you are the chosen one to a lot of different groups. and you know whats even better? you can break that immersion at any time and just dink about in a huge entertainment sandbox. use the console, spawn a million dragons, send an army of sellswords at a giant and watch as he flings them 300 feet into the air, put a bucket on someones head and rob them blind, you are only limited by your (twisted) imagination. my only concern is for my poor khajiits soul when she dies. it has been firmly pledged to both hircine and nocturnal, and hermaeus mora is showing some interest. i am also an agent of dibella and mara. poor lass is screwed.",205.7

"ehm so i have to write a report.. errr, well done.. whoever made this game? system and gameplay is so much in depth, more when you like something and suddenly you discover it has more features if you look deeper. i know its blah blah blah but that how i found this system xd storyline is one of the best! 50h isnt enough to finish the story.. well, not for me specially when you give me rpg to play. lel. graphics.. even though im running the game on ultra with very nice and smooth fps, i had to downloaded the hightextures and other graphics enhancment mods so id enjoy my moment in-game .. jungle xd this game is sick! i couldnt drop it for a little so id finish persona q .. which i just played the first 15min t.t best of luck lol.",74.4
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is the best game ive ever played. the amount of detail and care put into making this game its insane! ive put close to 800 hours into it and im still finding new places, people, and quest. once you finish one quest line, you just move on to the next. from killing dragons and taking their souls, to casting a firestorm spell to wipe out huge amounts of enemys this game has it. the world is yours in this game, and theyre no accidents. be who you wanna be weather it be elf, beast, or man. overall this game is amazing. there are still a few bugs present but just save often and you should be fine. if you want the rpg game of the decade, and hours of dragon slaying and shouting words of power to freeze or burn your foes, then this is it. fus ro dah!",1184.5

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a truly breathtaking experience, with a rich and interesting world that sinks its claws in from the moment it begins. right upto the point where youve left a mold of your backside in your chair and youre living off energy drinks and seeing daylight about as often as dracula himself. my favourite thing by far about skyrim is simply the ability to go do your own thing, with no linear story or forced path you can really explore all the world has to offer. be it dungeon diving, adventuring, slitting throats in the shadows, loosing arrows at bandits or hurling fireballs at all and sundry. i cant speak highly enough of this game and with mods - its taken to a whole new level. i consider this a must have for any fan of rpg games.",71.6
"i cant imagine if someone hated this game. its a never ending game whether you beat the main quest or not there is always something to do in skyrim. mess around, do quests, buy items, and ect you will never get bored! the graphics are fantastic and the atmosphere is great. there are so many fun, scary, and suprising quest that i wont spoil so you will have to see for yourself. the game is even better with dlc. that adds even more quests, weapons, spells, and armor to get. lucky for me i had gotten this game for only $8.00 for 2013s christmas sale. even if you have to get it for $30.00 its still worth it. if you happen to have the cash for it, you should totally buy it! :d",60.6

"the last game in the elder scrolls series that is single player. skyrim isnt my favorite of the series but i would recommend playing skyrim. you will most-likely need to mod it a little bit to be more pc friendly. great story, graphics, fun open world.",10.0
"im not quite sure whether i have written a review of this game or not and i honestly couldnt care less. i have spent hundreds of hours playing this game alot of it was offline some of it was online and dont even get me started on the countless hours i have spent modding this game to look good and better and what not. i love skyrim its like a drug that satisfies you and keeps you wanting more after long periods of time away from the game you get angry and upset for not having it there to play at a miniscule amount of time. i myself am in love with this game and its ancestors (not literaly) among the elder scrolls franchise. so if you are on the fence about skyrim you shouldnt be bcause skyrim is most definitely a well worth the money and time kind of game if you are a true die hard fan also the negative reviews you hear from people not on steam but on like ps3 and xbox 6/5 times are cod players.anyway this is a good game 11/10 ign would fap again.",246.0

"(((no spoilers will be revealed in this review!!!))) this game is so much fun. you get to roam around skyrim doing anything. the character creation is cool! you ride in on a carriage and are a prisoner. they do not see you on the list so you do your character creation then head to the chopping block. when they are mid chop off of your head a dragon rides in and destroys the town. then you go to riverwood and talk then go to whiterun and warn the jarl. you go to the western watchtower and kill a dragon then absorb its soul and become dragonborn. you can become an imperial or stormcloak. you get summoned to high hrothgar and are told to find the horn of jurgen windcaller. you then are distracted to riverwood again and meet a blade. later in the game you get to pick whether to kill parthurnaax or stay loyal to the blades.",406.8

"so i started out this game not sure what to expect, it was one of the few games where i start without seeing a lets play of first. i quickly got wrapped up in the intense storyline and quickly beat the main story. the game also includes an abundance of side quest that have taken me much longer to do than the actual storyline. this game is great for rpg loves and would be perfect for a roleplay, assuming you have the multiplayer mod.",207.9
"an amazing, action, adventure game based on fantasy times with dragons.",911.6
"great game.amazing storyline, with the acceptional overuse of the words arrow, knee, and dragons. i love this game and it normally works well with mods too, which is always a +1 to any game. overall, an amazing game, normally for anyone who likes fighting, medieval times, dragons, and rpgs such as fallout 3 and new vegas with an optional fps view. highly suggest getting the legendary edition though, it adds plenty of new quests and great things to do across the great world of skyrim. it is now on sale until dec. 3 with a great price.",14.7
"i recommend this game. goty for sure. i havent gotten too far into it yet, but its definitely top work from bethesda.",98.8
"shallow and static, yet still an excellent time sink with mods.",265.4
"i huge step up from morrowind and id go as far to say the mods are even better! as usual there will always be something to do, you can take any path you want do whatever you however you want! the diversity to the story and the world of skyrim itself is jaw droppingly amazing. if you own a pc and you dont have skyrim youre missing out on months of hibernation playing this. i own this on my ps3 as well so that im not tempted to cheat either haha!",132.8
"as with most rpgs, be prepared to cancle your plans do dive into the massive world of skyrim. i have spent countless of hours speaking with npcs, finishing side-quest, doing missions for the guilds, leveling up my skills, gathering ingredients, enchanting weapons, forging weapons, slaying dragons, discoverying places on the map, exploring caves, exploring mines, and starting all over for a different experince. if you are a fan of being an unstopple warrior/archer/mage, buy this game. side note: the dlcs are also jam-packed with interesting charcters, spells, weapons and storylines.",54.2
"few games have captivated me like skyrim. there are so many good things to say about it, but i am sure they have already been said. so i will mentiona few of the things that i loved, that are not often praised. first of all, i have put over 200 hours into my ps3 copy of this game, so much of my experience is based on that. i bought the game the day of release, and played for 20 hours non-stop. without even touching the main story line. the thing that drew me in was the absoulte depth of the scenery and the breathtaking beauty it brings. another huge positive of this game is its character upgrade system. many games have simple sliders that you increase whenever you level up, which makes things seem very unimportant. however, skyrim offers a huge skill tree that you can see individual skills that you can choose. finally, i like the the way the inventory is set up. although it was created with consoles in mind, it transfers pretty nicely over to pc (there are mods to make it just a little more mouse friendly). the information is presented in a clear, uncluttered way that really compliments the ambiance that the atmosphere portrays. buy this game, you wont regret it.",4.7
"i would go as far as to say the best elder scrolls yet. there are a few mechanic changes i disagree with, and i felt like it was released before it was finished, but most of the bugs are fixed now. with mods this game can be exactly what you want it to be. tons to explore. tons of game play. this game is enough to play like the rest of your life and never get bored.",51.2

"so there i was, climbing the mountain to high hrothgar when suddenly a great frost troll appeared. lydia tried to kill him but instead i let him tail me for about ten minutes until i got to the top. thinking i would be safe going inside high hrothgar, and completely neglecting to realize that a beast with apposable thumbs was after me, i breathed a sigh of relief. suddenly, a frost troll appeared in the doorway and as i prepared to die without saving in over an hour, the greybeards started shouting the beast to death. it was pinned against the wall and unable to get up because of the amount of shouts being thrown at it. after watching these men brutally attack a troll they simply carried on as if nothing ever happened. 11/10 would watch old men brutally attack animals again",9.6

"this is a very good game. it has eaten up way too much of my time and i am still loving it. it even works on my potato of a computer.",146.3
"the vastness of this game is stunning. after dramatic beginning you can set your foot anywhere you want and do what you want. there are quest behind every corner so theres always something to do. yes, it can get repetitive after some time, but vikings fighting the dragons beat it.",101.2

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",248.6

"skyrim is the antithesis of all that is elder scrolls and all that is role-playing games. if you are looking for a true sequel to the deep, immersive, true role-playing masterpieces that are daggerfall and morrowind, dont even budge. if you are looking for a absurdly dumbed down, easily exploitable action-adventure game with no depth, no weight on any of your choices, very shallow characters, randomly generated quests with repetitive patterns, a dull color scheme, copy-and-paste dungeons, a nonexistent story, and design choices obviously aimed for the shallow, casual crowd of players who have no idea what to do except click mouse1 (or right trigger,) then this game is for you. the music is good though. instead of skyrim, i recommend you get daggerfall instead. it actually has depth, story, an enourmous game world (in fact its the biggest game world ever made,) thought, and a price of $0. most importantly however, its an actual roleplaying game... and its actually good. dont waste your money on overhyped garbage.",30.6

"fun, immersive and seemingly endless gameplay. skyrim is without a doubt one of the best games i have ever played. and for good reason, the story is fantastic, the gameplay style is unmatched and the overall experience is near unbeatable. i would recommend this game for anyone who wants an adventure and who doesnt want a social life- you will waste a lot of your free time playing this. the difficulty curve can be a bit daunting, especially if you arent experienced with rpgs, but it pays off in the end. the end-game aspect is incredible and the replay value is huge, you can start a new adventure and it wont feel stale. and with the steam workshop, there is no end to the adventure.",126.3

"i nornally am not taken to the elder scrolls games but each one seems to be more and more enjoyable to me. the vast size of the play area can lead to some boring stretches but there is fast travel and horses to help you get were you need to go when you dont feel like walking all the way there. once again the darker side quest arc in the game turned out to be my favorite adn i never finished the main story line. still i found the niche i got into very enjoyable and i havent been able to find similar gameplay of this quality in another game.",93.0
"so much has been written about this game. i just want to add a couple things (even though theyve probably been covered in a hundred other reviews.) there is so much to do in this game. it will eat your life, and just when you think youve managed to escape its grasp, itll come back for another helping. the game is great by itself, but the modding community allows vasts amounts of customization. you will probably like this game if you like western rpgs, fantasy, or open worlds.",468.6

"for my money, skyrim is the best game to come out on steam in 2011. bethesda gave a 11-11-11 release date for this game, they stuck to it and they wisely used steamworks to launch it. bugs be damned, skyrims visuals will make your jaw drop, it has one of the best soundtracks of any fantasy anything, and its packed into a relatively tiny 5gb download on steam. in many ways skyrim is now my de-facto fantasy rpg that all others will need to live up to. the amount of content in the game is staggering, and the ways you can play are numerous. if you ever thought you might like to slay a dragon, skyrim is your jam. it has the best dragon fights ive ever played because they are completely unique every time and there are an infinite amount of dragons to be slain! i will be replaying this game for years to come, which is about right for how long it takes for a new elder scrolls to release.",401.8
"this game is the best way to lose whole chunks of your life! it has everything you could possibly want in an rpg. great character generation, one hell of a landscape to explore and the best fighting system in any game. it will run beautifully on quite modest pcs so you dont need an ubermachine to play it. all in all it is the best game bar none.",240.0

"this game is just to amazing not to play, especially if you like a very good rpg with a great story and action to it. the game is has alot of content in the regular campaign and in the dlc content you can buy with it, you will never really get board of the game because the massive amount of mods and i mean massive. the mods for this game verys from funny mods like a playable chicken character to very cool player homes and etc. so if you have 20$ on your steam and you have no ideas what to get i recomend the elder scrolls v: skyrim to you",36.0
"even though this is an old game, i can still call this by far the most interesting and addicting game of its century. i have beat it 4 times on all different consoles and still see every single aspect of the game refreshing and perfet. there is no lack in quality and is ruthless in its quest to make us never lose sight of whats important. never get shot in the knee with an arrow. i truly love this game and recommend it to anyone who likes to have fun and not be boring.",9.6

"this game is truly great. 1. free roam rpg: not much video games are like this, especially with the wonderful graphics skyrim has to offer 2. creation kit: a tool that comes with skyrim. such as... if you were getting tired of the game and you are absolutely over powered, you can create your own npcs, dungeons, and items and customize them. once you are done, you can upload them to the steam workshop to show other people your newest creation / mod. 3. choices: you can have an amazing amount of choices in skyrim. you can become a mage, warrior, theif etc... and with that, you can apply your skills in-game and play in the game 4. add-ons (dlc) hearthfire: you can get married, adopt children and freaking make your own house! dawnguard: you can become a vampire, learn about skyrims history and uncover amazing ancient artifacts dragonborn: you can learn more about ancient nords, the dragons and dragonborn in this game. dawnguard lets you travel to different places that were unaccessable before installing the content. (same with dragonborn dlc) 5. abilities: in skyrim you can cast magic (destruction spells, conjuration spells - my favorite- and more), have recreational skills (speech, smithing, etc...) or fighting skills (archery, one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons etc...) this game is truly remarkable. you should really consider buying it.",115.8

"a very good game. i would recommend skyrim on the pc over skyrim on a console any day. there is so much more that you can do on a pc than on a console. for example on a console youre happy you just completed the game and defeated alduin and you walk into whiterun and then you stop now what do you do, but if your on pc youre like i know what to do and the next thing you know your on the nexus. so what im trying to say is skyrims more fun with mods. you dont even have to get mods that completely change skyrim just get a few quest mods for more gameplay.",85.0

"skyrim is truly a must own game, one that goes down as one of the best of all time. im sure though that you probably know this already, and are looking to buy it on your own, and if you dont already own this game, you really should. welcome to skyrim, a world were nord fantasy and dragons aboad. here, magic wizards and sorcerers live, only to be lost in defeat to the returned dragons. now, all that is the armys of skyrim, waging war on both eachother and the dragons that have come. you, a prisoner in the crossfire of these wars, is destined to defeat the dragons and restore the skyrim world. though in skyrim, you may choose another path. like most open world games, your options arent limited to one path. you can choose from the evil of the world, or the conquering of the world. here, you can wander steep slopes, vast tundra, large bodies of water, and even slay dragons. all the while, you collect several items and other incredible peripherals known as shouts. the more you play, the more you just get pulled in. not to mention the modding community for the game is beyond massive, and the people who do make these mods create thousands of extra hours of content, and that is trimming it down to just a slim portion. simply put, skyrim is one off the best games ever made, ever. a must own for any gamer, and for the price, it would be a sin not to buy.",44.4

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"this game has so many issues how the hell did i almost put 100 hours into it. i got a mod that makes the music + sounds from zelda games, so that helps i guess.",83.5

"need i write a review on the greatest singleplayer game of our time?",102.4
"albsolutely one of the best games ive ever played. really enjoyable campaign and the side mission will keep you playing untill your fingers hurt. game is also kept interesting with the massive modding community and their dedication to keep skyrim new and more interesting. go and pick it up if you havent already, and prepare to not see anyone for a long long time",268.7
"a game about arrows, knees, fus ro dahs, exploding chickens and everything in between.",79.4
"great game to mod, plenty of mods to choose from to enhance open world play. a little buggy and the basic hud is not good for pc but mod hud skyui fixes most of the hud related issues.",214.4
"awesome sprawling game. i suggest a low to nonmagic build. it seems futzing with magic gets hard fast.",30.3
"such an amazing game! totally improves upon oblivion and borrows several elements that were good in the fallout series. a truly massive world with endless possiblities, things to do, and places to see.",322.4
"much was say abut these game and its mad mods one thing i can say abut it if you are not the type that can stay on one target for long there is a high chance you will never really finish skytim the game is an open world rpg that takes you far and wide with music and sounds and to meet the divans of the land these for me is the first game of the elder scrolls i got to play and i must say i have enjoy it much it will stay in my top 10 forever i will believe and if you ever want more all you need to do is go to the workshop and get some mods on the fun never ends even that i am not a great fan of the fighting system and the easy to trick ai to run around the main con i can find on these game is the loading screens something that really need to be clear for a world in these size, even that these is very pc spec related as for me the longest loading screen i got are abut less then a minute i got all ready to read all the loading screen tips and really some what get tired of seeing the same models over and over as of these i can say on some missions i have taken a delay as i did not want to pass one more loading screen once again as i forgot the key behind me the game was great and really enjoy it and il give it 9.5/10 (-0.5 for the loading screens)",146.4
"great graphics and challenging storyline. very addicting and fun to start from scratch once gameplay gets easier.",814.7
"a harrowing simulation of a world where animals fall from the sky and everyone has been crippled by arrows in knees. emergent horror gameplay as entire towns follow you into your house and have to be told to leave by your huscarl. marry a lizard but not a cat. become a mage. kill butterflies.",282.3
"endless gameplay, beautifull graphics! 100% worth it!",85.9
"its skyrim! need anyone say more. you can always find yourself coming back for more. even after beating the game 5 times over i am still doing stuff differently. great investment; a lot of bang for your digital buck.",86.6
"i dont really have to say much in this review other then if you do not own this game and you love rpgs, youve been missing out. from gorgeous visuals, to the diverse gameplay, no game has come near such a milestone. this game provides all of the necessary tools needed for a game of its kind to succeed. a gripping storyline, power to the player, and a hell of a lot of stuff to do.",32.4
"love the huge map that seems to go on forever. fast travel is also a plus",173.2

"great game with amazing mechanics. the dlc prices are a bit broken though.",27.6
"this game is old enough by now that everybody should be aware of it. the basics are this, lush open world that engages you into the nordic culture (based off of the norse culture). dragons flying about, enemies galore, some of the best sword combat you can find, decent sneak mechanics, and so much much more. skyrim has a very active modding community and with all the mods available, along with the dlcs, you can change the game entirely. i have spent over 300 hours on this game and still have yet to beat the main mission. thats how much content is in this game! another nice part of this for me at least, is that this is single player. this is a game that you can really just sit back and enjoy, even my non-gaming wife is completely hooked.",368.4
"very fun and exhilarating game. the moment i was named a thane and got my own servant i knew this was the only true do what you want rpg.",55.7
"get this game. the mod community has made this game my 2013 goty.",203.0
"outstanding game! i dare say. . . this may be the lord of the rings of a quality fantasy setting with deep lore and memorable names. anyone who is a fan of the fantasy role playing genre will not regret experiencing the lagacy of the elders scroll saga that is skyrim. fus ro dah!",128.1

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"this is my first computer / video game ever. its strikingly beautiful and i havent had too much trouble learning how to survive and enjoy this virtual world.",254.8
"a very fine addition to the tes series. it improves greatly upon tes iv oblivion but in certain aspects still is not as good as tes 3 morrowind. is a lot more modern and a fine choise for anyone except those who dislike rpgs pros: + large amount of content, literally easily 100+ hours on the main questlines alone + large amount of playstyle customization (not very limited to the base warrior, rogue and wizard classes) + immersive storylines + extensive modding community with virtually everything you can think of cons: - choices you make have little effect on questlines or the world - the ui is not very suitable for pcs, but mods fix this",302.2
"epic! another master piece of the guys from bethesda.",429.6
"sooo addicting! the vanilla game is fun by itself but if you ever get bored of it there are tons of mods to get for it. also for some reason it runs better on my pc than minecraft does...lol",193.6

"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",71.8

"been there, done that. but i still havent had enough! the elder scrolls v: skyrim is my very first tes game i have played and i love it. i remember playing world of warcraft ( yes, sue me ) around 2012(?) if my memory serves me right, and reading on guild chat saying about how tes v: skyrim was coming out soon and it peeked my intrest upon hearing it to be an open world rpg. there surely are others of such, but something about this game simply drew my attention regardless of being oblivious to the existence of the franchises or at least hardly being interested in it, but when seeing it being played and the glorious moment of taking my first step in tamriel, in skyrim ( though i was actually just sitting on the caravan, getting ready for execution ), i knew an epic adventure was awaiting me and still to this day, i have yet to have come to the day when i must recive an arrow to my knee and retire. *shot for the joke* anyway.. besides wow, this game is my most longest played game ever... well actually sc1 and wc3 belong in that as well, but thats already going off topic. recommend? yes!",506.2
"this game is simply amazing. ive already sunk in around 100 hours and dont feel tired of it at all. just a massive epic quest. the reviews are all right on this one. you really feel like youre on an epic adventure and its completely nonlinear. play how you want, at your own pace.",152.9
"10/10 welcome to skyrim fight, learn skills, cast spells, plunder, fight a fu**ing dragon!!! all in a days work of skyrim.i was so impressed by the visual concept and story line after 1 year on console it cathes me coming back for now on pc i play every day buy this even if you dont like rpgs this is amazing",4.9
"elder scrolls skyrim is what you expect it to be. it offers you everything you can ever imagine in the form of mods. the game becomes endless upon using said mods. and i will have to say, out of all games i have played, i have invested most of my time playing this game. it isnt difficult to play but offers an rpg experinece like no other. people may say it is a dumbed down version of the older elder scrolls and i will agree with them it totally is. but people have to understand it was made for the consoles first so it had to be dumbed down. and if you can look past the flaws skyrim has (like any other betehsda game), you will find yourself playing the game nonstop and even if you try to quit, youll end up finding yourself back on it >_<",780.2

"10/10 you can make your 360 arrow shot to a dragon.",92.5
"fine game. i didnt play it for very long because i play it on a console instead. very nice story and a huge free-roam world to explore.",6.8
"this game is the best game i have played since destiny alpha, the freedom is outstanding, although the graphics may be considered out-of-date the game plays flawlessly with my gtx 750ti at max graphical settings (if thats what it is called?) - a strong 9.5/10 ~ you need to play this if you havent!",333.8
"awesome game, high replay value, go smack some drauger and kick some sabre cats",9.4
"i didnt think i could get into an elder scrolls game after a failed attempt at morrowind many moons ago. however, i took a chance during the steam sale and am so glad i did. this game is certainly able to suck you in; the highest praise i can give it is that i literally lost an hour and a half playing it and had no clue that much time had passed. definitely engrossing and the fact that youre not locked into any standard build makes me happy.",21.9
"i used to be an adventure like you , but i took an arrow to the knee",161.8
"this game is very good, and very imersive, the only thing i dont like about it is it can start to feel a little repetitive.",124.7
"skyrim is absolutely astounding. the visuals, music, and voice acting are top notch. it may have just been me, but i walked from place to place or rode the horse instead of fasttravelling simply because the world is so beautiful. there are loads of weapons, armor, spells, and shouts to find and collect. you can even buy a house, which you can fill with books, or showcase your weapons and armor, or just hang out. i bought the house in markarth, which happens to look just like helms deep from lord of the rings. it even has mods. lots of mods. it also has glitches. lots of glitches. but that shouldnt stop you from playing the  out of the best game in the elder scrolls franchise. nearly flawless 9.5/10",89.9
"definitely my favorite in the series! skyrim is a smooth play experience with so many different options that it makes the game replayable over and over again. if youre choosing between pc and console, go wtih pc. the controls feel a lot smoother and give you more manuverability. excellent game!",10.7
"i was going to write a recommendation for this game, but then i took an arrow to the knee.",96.7
"i played skyrim for a few days solid. then not much after that. skyrim, i feel, suffers from the sheer amount of stuff to do which kind of ends up being fetch quests. too many quests and too many places to go for too petty of an objective. skyrims greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. its so huge and theres so much to do, theres nothing to do.",97.6
"i only just redownloaded this game and even after a long time away the mods just always add more to the gameplay.",15.4
"so i guess that this is a rather late review. i have already played it for 74 hours on the ps and 50 hours on the pc. why do i still play it? details and mods baby, details and mods.",126.9
"this game is an awesome open world fantasy bonanza that has huge potential for replay.",56.2
"did nearly everything to do in this plus dlc but then i get the legendary edition in a steam sale and downloaded a balls ton of mods, not that good without mods in my opinion. it is good but 29.99 for the legendary edition mhhh no. but like its good i would get it but on sale and get mods (the nexus not steam workshop!)",22.0

"absolutely brilliant, although in some parts a little (too) streamlined in comparison to oblivion.",427.1
"oh my god... how much content can you cram into a game!? my completionist streak kicks in after a few hours and i suffer total brain failure, as i try to track too many quests and objectives, while simultaneously deliberately not advancing the plot, in case i miss anything. it results in complete nervous system collapse and i then have to start all over again. still... an absolutely brilliant game (though get some good mods for it!).",188.8
"awesome game. hourse of entertainment and a full world to explore as you choose the path you want your character to take.",409.5
"massive world. pretty awesome, really. plus the modding scene is epic. get it.",346.6

"one of the best action rpg games so far, as bethesda has once again managed to expand the elder scrolls saga - this time with norse-themed adventure named after the frozen, snowy tundrous province skyrim. altrough not so original like its predecessors - oblivion or morrowind - the newest addition to this wonderful series is heavily influenced by nordic and scandinavian folklore. while morrowind was the most original place ive ever visited in game, and oblivion managed to bring the feeling of imperial rome - skyrim takes a different - albeit very common and not-so-original path - dragons, huscarls, fjords, hargravens and its own version of valhalla - sovngarde. pack your winter clothing - dont forget to bring your axes and horned helmets, and... be prepared for excellence - but not perfection, as skyrim tries to grasp the throne of rpg genre - but it still cannot best its older, more mature (and in my opinion flawless) siblings - morrowind and oblivion.",141.6

"we have come a long way from 8-bit monochrome fantasy role playing adventure games like ultima, trying to capture our childhood memories of reading j.r.r. tolkiens lord of the rings, or similar books. this latest attempt by bethesda is the most accessible so far, trying to combine an open fps style game play in a fantasy rpg 3d world. this game is doing what ultima ix ascension tried to do years ago. the richness of 2d rpgs, we all love and know, translated into a 3d world. gothic, morrowind, oblivion, the witcher - many games tried before. skyrim (and witcher 2) show how far we have come. endless hours of gameplay, from catching bees to fighting dragons with the sword you crafted and enchanted yourself. the steam workshop and nexus mods will keep this game alive for years to come.",49.0

"it says i hardly have any time on this game, but thats unture. ive spent countless hours on xbox and other peoples computers, and i know what this game is like. this is my favrioute game, hands down. i dont know what i would do without it. so, do i recommend it? yes buy it asap if someone wont let you, tie them up and lock them in a closet. if you dont have the money, steal someones credit card. if you cant steal, since your pickpocket and sneak is such , force someone to buy it for you. if they wont, go to bethesda. find their skyrim people, and make them let you play it. if they dont, ask them to buy it for you. now, if they dont, now you go to your friends and ask them. if they dont, let your rage out on them. if you still cant get a hold of this game, and youve robbed banks, killed people, gone to the moon and back , slashed through jungles and slogged through swamps, turn real life into skyrim. just turn real life, everyday, into your own skyrim. then wreak havoc throughout the country side. at the end, youll realize what youve done over trying to get a game. it would be worth it.",30.7
"tesv: skyrim is possibly one of the best games i have ever played so far. the level of detail, the immersion, the plot and storyline all contributes to a perfect almost flawless game. it has set the bar for open world rpg and open world games in general. if the developers ever think of creating another elder scrolls game then it must go beyond what tes v has given us. it has been almost three years since the game was released yet it still surpass a lot of newer games in the market. heck i am still playing it, it never gets old and the mod support that the developers has released has ensured that tes v: skyrim will be played in the years to come or until a new elder scrolls game comes out. any gamer, hardcore or casual will definitely get a lot out of skyrim. it is the first western game to recieve a 40/40 perfect score in the japanese gaming magazine famitsu, which is already saying a lot. overall anyone who wants to be immersed should pick-up and play tes v: skyrim.",933.6

"skyrim is everything i came to expect from a free-roam rpg. from character customization to spells and enchantments to the different enemies that come crashing through after you on your quest, this game delivers. a healthy mod community also delivers engaging (and sometimes ridiculous) mods to suit your fancy and every occassion. i recommend playing the dlc as well once youve finished the skyrim original content.",325.9
"ahhh skyrim what can i say that hasnt allready been said. amazing titel in the elder scrolls series. complete open world... hell you dont even have to do the main questline if you dont want to. pretty amazing graphics even better with mods. the workshop community is great. can be buggy but its bethesda and hey youve got console commands right. so overall if your debating weather or not to buy this game... stop and just buy it.",16.1

"skyrim is a genre unto itself. if you like rpgs with epic storytelling, have deep-seated kleptomania, or fancy yourself a bloodthirsty sociopath, then look no further! this is the game is for you! the greatest part about skyrim is that once you beat it you can simply add/remove mods, and bam! its like a brand new game. warning: modding side effects may include lost days browsing nexus mods, adding/removing/rearranging mods endlessly, and only playing the game itself for 5 minutes at a time. 10/10 - just shut up and give bethesda your money.",260.3
"its a nice rpg with a huge open world, many details and (sort of) nice graphics, and its certainly very immersive at the first playthrough. the only problem i had was that many of the characters of skyrim werent that memorizable (if i think about it today). however, the game and its dlcs are certainly rpg-masterpieces which any rpg-fan should have -at least- tried +there are tons of mods (which are fairly easy to install -> steamcommunity) to enhance your experience!",554.1

"great game. completed it originally on the console, and now got it cheap on a sale through steam for old-times sake. no doubt will enjoy ploughing hours into this again, especially with all the dlc i didnt have before. would echo some other reviews and comments that the engine they used is certainly dated now, and mechanics are a bit clunky, but who really cares if it plays good. i mean, fez is brilliant and that just a bunch of old-school pixels.",1.2

"there is so much you can do in skyrim. you can explore however you want and where ever you want. there are so many possibilities that can happen in this game. skyrim can have a true sense of immersion. with heartfelt speeches, literary epics and tremendous npcs, you can feel like you truly are a native of the country. this game does not tell you to do anything, but you decide what to do. other games tell you to save the world, but skyrim makes you want to save it. throughout the game you will find lore and legends that show the tremendous culture and features that went into the creation of the game. in skyrim you start from fighting dragons and bandits and go on to learning ancient powers, fighting for kings, for honour, harnessing untold energy and even doing the will of the gods. even after all this, you can find thousands of mods that vary from adding new location, items, quests and npc, to entirely new ways of playing and immersification. while there are hundreds upon hundreds of quests and people within this game, you will not stop finding individuals and new experiences within the endless amount of adventuring you can partake in.",280.9

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim (2011) was released nearly three years ago, and almost everything that can be said about it has been said. the massive open world, the army of side quests and the epic dlc have all been talked about to death. so what do i say? its a good game and i heavily recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy/rpg genre.",44.4
"honestly get sum mods and go crazy and get some train dragonz",419.3
"enjoy hundreds upon hundreds of copy-pasted dungeons, boring enemies, uninteresting skills, basic spells, fetch quests, glitches and bugs. take in the breath takingly small skyrim (if this is a country then how big is the planet.) as you click on draugrs, click on bandits, click on falmers, click on spiders, click on wizards, and click on dragons. watch as your hero cinematically kills the easiest enemies in any game ever, and when you turn up the difficulty, the game lazily only increases the enemy health and damage. feel like you havent gotten any stronger due to the amazing scaling enemies. but people keep telling me that this is the best game ever so i guess theyre right. i give this game a 10/10.",118.3
"quite enjoyed this game. not much of a fan of oblivion, but this is certainly an improvement. this is my most played steam game to date.",175.9
"this game is amazing in every way and the best part about it, you can mod it to make it even better!!! =d",311.6
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a brilliant rpg that takes you into a wonderful world of quests from collection and faction missions, killing foes from undead dungeons to slaying dragons that roam the sky. create characters that suit you and develop them into great thanes of the land. skyrim will never leave you bored as it has a never ending quest system and npcs that really make you feel that each and every quest is just as important as the main quest line. a must have for every rpg fan",52.2

"i was attacked by a dragon before i even reached riverwood, before it blew fire at me it said ima need about tree fiddy. now it was about this time that i realized what i thought was a dragon was an 8 story tall crustacian from the paleozoic era. i yelled to it i aint givin you no tree fiddy you damn monster! and it then retreated into the wilderness, never to be seen again. 11/10 would paleozoic era again.",76.9
"skyrim, and oblivion before it, set a high standard for rpg. non-linear = stuck on a quest? ill ignore that one for now. modding = add quests, superweapons, difficulty, races, areas, more. radiant quests = game creates new quests, game never ends. my hero has everything, killed everyone? keep the old hero, and start different kind of character. cant find the mod you like? i did not have to be a pro to do small mods on my own. there are puzzles. but no pixel-hunting. the dlc is good. but truly optional.",530.5
"so another brother to the family of elder scrolls ! this game is just awesome. open world, cool skill tree, crafting weapons armor potions and other.questline is enjoyable and side quests are fun too ! if u like rpgs where you can travel around a huge map then go ahead and buy it !",29.7
"stunningly beatifull and great storyline too, get it.",13.7
"prepare to lose yourself in one of the most immersive environments in video game history. this game is just plain awesome. replay value is incredibly high (my third playthrough was my favorite). i tried to use some of the mods that are more popular but struggled to get them to run properly (user error, im sure). i havent bought much of the dlc, mainly just because ive already played this game so much that i dont want to get sucked back into it when there are other games in my library that i havent even tried yet. my only complaint is that players can break the game by becoming a level 100 alchemist, making potions that improve restoration ability, then creating crafting gear that is incredibly overpowered. i one-shot the final boss in my final gear. note: the best storyline in the game is the wizards college in winterhold. dont neglect these quests! being a destruction mage is very fun!",265.7
"worth it, if only for the epic mods. civil war story is subpar and main storyline, while epic, was a bit too short. then again, dlc has promise.",234.0
"omg! this is game is a massive! ive got so many quests to complete. everytime i run into someone theyre always asking for my help. since im so nice, i cant refuse. fortunately ive been keeping track of everything in my journal so i will eventually get to helping everyone if i dont get side-tracked with just exploring the world.",72.6

"the only question you can ask yourself when even thinking about this game is why am i not playing this right now?",158.1
"this isn;t my first elder scrolls game, but it is the elder scrolls game that hooked me. granted i havent played anything before oblivion (despite really wanting to), i think skyrim is definitely the future of tes games. of course this is just my opinion and i know just about as many people who prefer older versions of tes games as i know people who love skyrim more. either way, the mods make the game better by far and i will never by a bethesda game on a console ever again. 10/10 will always play again :)",81.4

"i owe the destruction of both my social life and gpa to this game. but it was totally worth it!",855.9
"one word describes this game: epic!!! i mean this is the best rpg i have ever played in my whole life! it has so much depth to it, so many choices to be made, so many locations to visit, so many quests to complete, very big expansive and dynamic world of skyri makes it the best game i have ever played. you can be whatever you like, you have an in-depth character customization, you can pick up almost everything you see in the game, and the whole world is open. no boundaries, just exploring the wast region of skyrim. i played this game before on xbox and im sure i spent at least 1000 hours in the game. but the game doesnt stop here, there are also cool dlc-s and tons of mods. so, if you want to have a really good invest in the game, you must really own this game! you are not going to regret it!",236.4
"hands down one of the best games of all time! the lore, the world, the gear!!! this game is amazing! you can spend hundreds and hundreds of hours in this game, with the same save, and still find dozens of new npcs, dungeons and miscellaneous quests! the combat is fun and satisfying. the voice acting can tend to get a little dull at times seeing as pretty much everyone is voice acted by this same small amount of people. the in game secrets, references, and easter eggs are brilliant. especially the three billy goats gruff easter egg. there are dozens of books to read which add plenty of extra lore and history to the games continents and world called nirn. skyrim is an amazing province, with its massive mountains, swamps, grasslands and so on. the dlcs are also brilliant! adding dozens to hundreds of hours of extra gameplay! the worst parts about the game has probably got to be the common quest glitches, which stop you from starting or proceeding in a quest. some quests also dont have quest markers at times. the levelling up also takes hours. 215 hours and im level 62. its gonna take a while to reach level 80. anyway, this game is brilliant and a must own. buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy",289.2

"if you have fallout 3 or new vegas then get this game. if you are into a fantasy environment that feels vast and allows you to roam, then get this game. if you like to be able to mod games to your hearts content, then get this game. however, if your looking for something that is multiplayer then you may want to read the game details first. its single player; but i still like it anyway. mods are able to be found at skyrim nexus and there is a tutorial there for how to make it work with steam. i know that there is a workshop for this game here, but bigger file sized items are better from the website.",278.3

"may not be as big or as long as previous elder scroll titles, but its just as fun, the graphics are better if you care for that kind of stuff, i know i do sometimes, shouting at dragons cool stuff, the dlcs are awsome and badass, worth the money, not to mention the workshop for all the amazing mods you can get.",55.3

"the first elder scrolls game i ever played was morrowind for pc, over the years ive played the subsequent releases on both pc and xbox 360. i think that these games are pretty much the best value video games or entertainment you can buy. the level of detail that goes into each is staggering, thinking about how much time and effort that goes into each new game is incredible. skyrim raises the bar and the sheer wow factor again with detailed lore, graphics, and tight gameplay. the feeling i got playing morrowind all those years ago returned the first time i played this, every turn in the road led to something new to explore. adventures are more fleshed out, and what starts off with one quest, usually ends up turning into a series as you play. this isnt even taking into account the workshop content that can be added by player creations. the one reccomendation i would have for people returning to the series or even thinking of playing this over again. i would say is that you should play it on at least adept setting, really - the harder you set the difficulty the more rewarding each battle can feel. skyrim for me lived up to the crazy hype train that it first rolled in on and more. theres just so much to the game as with most other bethesda games, it would be hard not to like it. skyrim for me is an easy 10/10",101.1
"possibly the one of the best open world rpgs out there today. the ability to mod it makes the gameplay almost endless. i myself disliked the previous games tes3 and tes4, but found myself wrapped up in 5 as if it was a totally different experience. honestly, if you didnt like the previous 2, you will probably like it. if you loved one of the previous two, you are going to be disapointed for some reason, but still, try it. while you may not think its as great as your favorite, im sure you will still enjoy it.",164.1

"skyrim is one of my top favorite games. this game is huge and full of content infact is has so much content i still havent found everything in the game and i have about 200 hours of play time. this game also has a huge modding community so you basicaly cant run out of content there is always new mods to make the game look better and add more creatures to fight.",908.2
"i have not been a big fan of the elder scrolls series but skyrim i found was a really good game the controls are quite easy to learn and arent to complex as well the graphics of this game is super but lags out a bit however that could be my laptop overall i would rate skyrim 4/5",2.2
"this is maybe the best rpg game, if not the best game of all time. the map is huge and it has many side quests and random quests and you can really just do whatever, from murdering citizens to riding dragons!",55.1
"you can go deer hunting with fireballs. need i say more?",322.7
"skyrim takes all the good stuff (and a lot of the broken stuff!) from oblivion and improves on it. a bombastic, open, fun rpg. go hunt deer, craft potions and hit bandits in the face with a big axe. and dont forget the infinite dragons!",337.1

"great game, do as you like with in it and amazing graphics espically with shaders and mods",1.1
"dlcs are the best! so someone need to buy them for me, thanks!",73.3
"first of all. this has to be one of the most fun games of all time. i think it is the only game i have ever played where it litterally does not end. you will always find a new cave, new enemy, new quests, new things to do, etc. if you are a fan of lord of the rings, you must get this game. even if you dont like lord of the rings, you should get it. the story is so engaging and nothing feels tacked on or out of place. everything has a purpose and everything has a reason for being there with their own story. its great! i have no idea why you would not get this game. oh side note, the dlc for the game is great even though i dont own it yet. i have played it on my friends computer and they add even more content to an aready content loaded game. in closing, if you dont buy this game you are a fool!!! a fool!!! it is way to good to pass up rating: 11/10 blows me away",131.1
"great amount of content excluding the mods. i have always loved the elder scrolls franchise and skyrim doesnt let me down. skyrim is pure beauty with its awesome mapping work and the amount of details. landscape is huge and full of places to be explored. combat is enjoyable but happens to be really heavyweight unlike its predecessors. glitches are a huge part of the experience and for some reason patches are no longer made. its a good game, you should buy it.",158.2
"such an amazing game even just with the vanilla version, however with mods on pc the options are endless!!! even at full price this game is well worth the money, but on sale this is a no brainer to buy. also very much worth it to check out the dlc.",1218.3
"good game at first but then a couple mods later i found myself riding velociraptors and wearing my skimpy clown outfit as i slaughtered all life with my bustersword. i would recomend this game to anyone who hates doing good deeds for people and loves to murder everyone in an entire country with more bandits than civilians!",257.6
"one of the best games i have ever played. there is so many things to do. i love the fact i can customize my character - looks and especially their skills! i love being a dragon slayer.",131.0

"utterly engrossing, its easy to become lost in the world of skyrim. its also easy to feel incredibly overwhelmed at the amount there is to do, something that turned me off the fourth elder scrolls game, oblivion. skyrim, however, seemes more balanced for the inexperienced player and there is plenty to do. i find it easy to focus on one goal; put myself in the shoes of my character and go with what they would do rather than try to do everything.",16.6
"if you want to lose your job, girlfriend and everyone close to you, play this game. totally immersive. 9/10",0.9

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"how to begin? i started playing skyrim on xbox 360 back in 2011 christmas when i was still a console peasant, and boy did i not see the sunlight ever again, massive huge world, so much to do, never bored whatsoever, the storyline is average to good, not as immersive and gripping as oblivion, but to make up for it is the multiple dialogue choices you can choose during this, compared to oblivion with limited answers. the graphics are awesome too, they have slightly looked a little worse as time went by and advancements have been made, but with a few mods on pc, in which i got skyrim in early 2013, its very worth it, there is also so much playback value with the side quests and the character specialities, such as mage, thief and warrior, or even a hybrid of those classes. however the few downsides i have seen is its really poor engine and its lod, and how the water on the game looks so crap in the distance, and also how it is quite badly optimized, so even the beefiest of rigs will kneel before having an enb mod or something in that nature. overall, my favourite es game in the series, basically tied with oblivion. such an engrossing and amazing game, truly. so excited for es6, these games never fail to make me not sleep at night with the excitement of its release.",174.3
"skyrim is a fantastic installment in the elder scrolls series. it presents an amazing world to explore with interesting characters and endless hours of dungeon crawling and looting. if you enjoy a fantasy adventure with great music and atmosphere, and have 300 hours to kill, skyrim is your best bet for a satisfying journey through the northern territory of tamriel.",57.6

"when i first picked up skyrim back in 2011 or early 2012, i thought it would be a game that i would play for a couple of hours and get bored of it. how wrong i was. not only does it have great content, gameplay and graphics, there is also a ton of mods out there that keeps the game fresh also allowing you to customise the game to your play style. for those who feel that graphics are important in a game, just use an enb and graphic mods to further enhance the already beautiful world of skyrim (once again many options out there that caters to pretty much everyone). dlcs are great, adding even more top notch content for many more hours of gameplay, not to mention the many side quests that you could choose to take up in the vanilla game as well. doesnt matter whether you played the previous games in the series (i hadnt at the time i purchased skyrim), youd still have a blast playing. strongly recommend this game especially for people who love open world adventure and role playing games.",192.3

"what can i say about elder scrolls v, and about elder scrolls generally... -first, theres a huge open world you can explore with a lot locations worth exploring. skyrim awaits... -second, there is perfect skill system, it should be like that in every rpg. you can be both master swordsman and archmage. you can learn every skill and create your unique combat style. -third, probably most important, but i put it third cause open-world and great skill make it lot better... it is story, probably one of the best known game stories, but i will also describe it here... youre dragonborn or doavhkiin on dragon language, hero with mortal body, a soul of dragon and voice stronger than any other mortal or dragon. your desteny is to defeat aduin, dragon who wants to eat world. -fourth, side storylines. they are great, you really should play all of them if you play tes:v. you can participate in civil war, join warriors guild called companions, become archmage, be infamous dark brotherhoods assassin or do crime in thieves guild. -fifth, not so important fot true gamers but it makes gameplay better, graphics... everyone will agree tes:v looks great and really you can really feel like you are in skyrim. i really like it. its one of the beast game i played. 11/10 hope review helps you, theknightmarema p.s. buy the game!",64.1

"the greatest open ended rpg of all time hands down. well worth rebuying this on pc even after 100 percenting it on 360. the graphics are so insanely better it doesnt even look like the same game. so much more detail. even things as pointless as catching butterflies or picking flowers for alchemy are better, because you can actually see them on the pc version.",72.4
"this game is absolutely amazing and i would recommend it for anyone into open world and rpg.",21.6
"by far one of my favorite games. the extensibility of this game with mods still makes this game worth playing years after its release. i find myself coming back to it whenever i finish other games.",172.5
"great game lots of stuff to do, and if you get bored with what the game has there are lots of mods you can get for it.",254.2
"with no mods, its just a very cool rpg. with mods, this is one of the best game ever.",212.1
"this game should be in everyones library. the base game alone offers countless hours of joy, and mods from the steam workshop offer much more. reach that 50 mod limit imposed by the workshop? check out the skyrim nexus!",402.8
"skyrim is not perfect. yes, there are a lot of bugs (although i get the feeling that there are less than in oblivion). yes, the combat could be better and dual wielding is nothing special. yes, the main story is rather weak and dragons get annoying after a while. yes, the game walks a thin line between streamlining and dumbing down typical elder scrolls elements. no, the menus are not designed for pc and are just plain bad. but ill be damned if i dont lose myself in it every time i fire it up. even with my insane playtime i still discover new quests, locations, items and so on. the lore is great (no worries, youll be able to jump right in if you havent played the previous games). the music is some of the best game music ive ever heard. i... i dont even know where to begin. the game is glorious. dawnguard and dragonborn are good dlcs that have quite some flesh on them and are absolutely worth their money (dont bother with heartfire though, that shouldve been added for free). if this int enough for you, you can always look around on the steam workshop or the nexus for mods, because mods are what keeps this game going. you can even create your own stuff. no game will ever be perfect but skyrim comes damn close in my opninion. if you havent already, check it out!",695.7
"1 word, cool game. more words, mod the hell out of it until you die",321.8
"you know this game right? right?! not much to recommend here. buy it, play it, love it",42.7
"big, i didnt beat the main quest because i was finding juniper berries. modding took an arrow to the knee this time around lmoa reference meme.",58.7
"this is by far one of the best rpgs ever made, and getting it on pc is hands down the best choice, there are so many amazing mods that you can turn it into a whole new game 10/10",354.7
"you should play because i get achievements for making lame reviews! woot! i am still waiting for the elders scrolls online beta.",55.3
"this product out of the box is pathetic and virtually unplayable. fortunately there is a mod that makes this game bearable, skyui, unfortumately it does not play well with steam. i have played the elder scrolls series since inception up through oblivion and knights of the nine. skyrim removes all of the good and adds alot that is horrible. in morrowind/oblivion there were no rails and the character moved with ease across your screen, if you could climb it you could go there, on the other hand skyrim has added barriers, free form traveling results in the dreaded invisible barrier blocking your passage. combat is unbalanced at best, tons of bugs and glitches to circumvent though, quite challenging.",36.6
"completely awesome, i cant even imagine how much better the next one will be o.o",342.0
"this game will give you entertainment for countless hours. this is one of the least linear games that i have ever seen. there are plenty of quests for you to venture out on, and lots of customization options for your playstyle. you can be a knife-wielding assassin-type, a spellsword warrior, a wizardy mage, or even a vampire (dawnguard dlc) or a werewolf. skyrim is a vast land with an ongoing civil war, and if you choose a side in it you can lead it to victory. it is one of my favorite games of all time. pick it up if you can.",171.0
"great free roam and combat. has a really nice feel to it and doesnt get boring (as ive been playing for three years on console and pc). highly recomended for anyone that likes non modern games like me!",3.2

"lets face it. if you dont own this game, then you should. go and buy it. now. _",120.9
"skyrim... this game is simply brilliant! i take it nearly everyone knows the famous tes series, the brilliant rpg games where we play a chosen hero from the ego perspective and save the world of tamriel from sheer destruction over and over again... skyrim is a brilliant addition to the series, with wonderful graphics a brilliant story and some awesome new systems compared to oblivion. however, a few of the favourite systems, such as the create your own spell have been removed to many peoples dismay, and spells now must be wielded as weapons, but they made up for that with dual-wielding and dual-casting ;d",258.4
"its really fun and over all a great game and i think everybody should try it.",346.8
"my favorite pc game of all time (havent tried eso yet) but i wish i could choose either 32-bit or 64-bit, because i have a 64-bit laptop but i only have the 32-bit game, and i dont know how to change that.",37.3
"as for me probably second best rpg ever after witcher 1. in two weeks made over 40 hrs. right now on hold. great ammount of mods to improve almost anything you want plus a lot of extra quests for end game. i expect at least of 200-300 hrs of fun before cracking it. if you love rpg and open world game its a must have. 9/10 (cause bethesda dont care to remove some bugs). 11/10 in scale of rpgs.",67.4
"no words for such an amazing game fun for the whole family",140.9
"there is so much that can be said about tesv. though much more streamlined than its predecessors, skyrims gameplay is the most fluid of all the elder scrolls games. add to this one of the greatest modding communities in gaming, and you will never have to leave tamriel again (including to play that terrible mmo).",1257.1
"i getta kill things and craft things and kill more things and choose things >.<",84.4
"this game is relatively meh. theyve managed to dumb this series down to something that can bore me in a few hours. hint: only put points into the strength/health/carry weight/armor/toughness/everything stat. being a magician is worthless. every play through you should be a sneaky melee character that can use a bow. also enjoy fighting nothing but the same bear over and over.",94.3
"even though this game is now three years old, this game is still fantastic. so many different choices to pick from just from the vanilla skyrim. browse the steam workshop and get so much more out of this game. browse any modding site for skyrim and the possiblities are endless. this is an absolute must have for those who love rpgs.",293.9
"awesome game! i love the open sandbox feel, and the leveling ability!",229.8
"cant say enough about skyrim. the game has it all, exploring, combat, and great storys. not even how fantastic the crafting is. buy it and just sit back and enjoy the world that opens up in front of you.",104.5

"this game has the basic elements you would expect out of a rpg. additionally the modding community is far better than most others in my opinion.",60.3
"one of the best experiences in gaming, add in mods and its also one of the most creative and it looks great to boot.",70.5
"skyrim is second only to oblivion, and thats only because of one aspect that will probably surpass it at some time. the mods for skyrim are good, some are even fairly amazing and world making, but its still nothing compared to the amount of mods and the quality of mods for oblivion. skyrim is overall amazing, save for the combat (though that can be modded to a degree) and the main story lacking in any real substance besides kill x to make sure world doesnt end. i got my moneys worth out of it, especially with the dlc (my favorite being dawnguard). 7.5/10, would buy and play again.",390.6
"this game is absolutely amazing. buncha dragons (yo), buncha story quests (yo!), hot babes and hot guys (yoooo!) and just a lot of friggin crap you can do (yooooooooo!) 10/10 would buy this game 30 times, go play it. too op, too fun.",8.4

"this is the best open world rp game ive ever played :)",133.7
"animations are terrible, armor and weapon system is lackluster(by the end of the game the only options you really have is stahlrim and dragonbone, and with max enchanting, wearing anything else is pointless). theres no sense of mystery or unknown in terms of items. aswell as there is no sense of value in any of the armor and weapons (except for legendaries, but you know when your going to get one), and there is no value because the rarest item you will find now [say daedric sword] will most likely be in the hand of every bandit you see in 5 or so more levels. as i said earlier, animations are terrible, all weapons are copypasted and thirdperson is junk.",295.7
"one of the best games ive ever played. definitely the best rpg ive ever played. if you havent bought this yet, you should!",538.6
"this is the best game i have ever played! better than fallout/3 and better than boarderlands, done over 300+ hours in this game and taken time off work just to play it... awesome game, and looking forward to whatever dlc they release that will make the game continue, but i aint even finished the main game yet! totally awesome, and i quote i cannot recommend this game enough",966.5
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"ive played almost nothing since getting this game. this game gets you to play it....alot. send halp...actually no dont, having too much fun.",835.4

"great game with awesome mods i rate it ten out of ten its worth the money but its a heavy game not best for old and light computers.",91.7
"one of the best games of all time, hands down. bethesda churns out another epic and exceedingly large tale set in a very open world. with the immense support for modding in the community, skyrim can stand out as one of the most beautiful games imaginable. the modding community itself is a testament to bethesdas greatness, in being so supportive of community content. this support enables new content from the modding community that enhances bethesdas world and offers many improvements and innovations the original vanilla game could not offer. even if the game is played vanilla, without any modifications, it is a beautiful game, full of wonderfully written lore and story.",898.1

"great game, bit glitchy at first but i thoroughly enjoyed playing skyrim.",38.8
"you can depend on bethesda to change things up with each elder scrolls game, for better of worse according to differing opinions. theres alot of new elements and stories to be told in skyrim, not to mention the atmosphere and sheer scale of the effects of combat, dialogue and pure exploration. theres a wonderful journey to be had in such a small space - 9/10",818.4
"do you really need another review to convince you to get the game? skyrim is one of the greatest games of all time - if not for the great graphics, engaging environment, variety of equipment, and vast mod community, the massive open world setting and hundreds of hours of quests and storylines make this game nearly unbeatable. to be fair there are some small shortcomings, often in gameplay balance and such, but virtually any shortcoming you can think of has a mod to resolve it. the content from both the game and the community make skyrim a nearly endless game. overall 9.7 / 10 stars feel free to check out the mods that i have created as well, i have over 15 different mods uploaded to the workshop for your enjoyment :)",314.0
"beautiful and uncomprehensibly expansive, skyrim will keep you busy for way more than 100 hours with its massive selection of main, side and random quests, ranging from leading a civil war to helping out a talking dog. and holy , you have to see this thing on a retina display.",58.9

"a very fun rpg game would be a good idea for anyone who enjoys rpg style games to try out",561.0
"everyone talks about how great this game is, and its pretty good, open modding and the ability to do anything anytime you want sounds awesome. vikings and magic, in theory i love it. the downside is not so much. i realize games like this take years to make and hundreds of man hours are put into it. but it just wasnt polished enough. i wanted to love this game, i tried. but it kept throwing me out of it. (not like a broken game install error) but a immersion issue. for instance: i was the arch mage of the wizards guild, yet everytime i went to a main city and run into the city wizards they would tell me i should go to the wizards guild to apprentence. seriously, do they not know i am the arch mage? i couldnt have been that much harder to get a sound recording of the wizards saying welcome arch mage. and when you finish the arch mage quest they say that instead of youre a novice. there were more, nothing seriously huge, just polishing bits, it was enough though to throw me out of the game and i could never get back in. i still play from time to time, but there are more immersive games out there i would rather play.",64.1

"one of the most amazing games, if you dont enjoy these games, your broken",229.4
"refusing to stop, the elder scrolls franchises newest entry, skyrim, goes down kicking till the very end. admist civil war, the eater of worlds, or a bad- dragon decides to come back to add to the turmoil, and why not? it would seem that the time is ripe for dragons to come and gourge on the souls of our world. however, as luck would have it, there is (as in all fantasies) one person who can stand in the dragons way. watch out keanu reeves because a new chosen one is in town, get ready to hack, slash, burn, freeze, stun, scare, eat, stab, punch, shoot, throw, shout, claw, jump, and fling your way to victory past racist guards, foolish bards, crappy elves, drunken nords, or legendary monsters of epic proportions. hoprfully you do not have a girlfriend or 8-5 job, because if you do, you will not have the time to one-hundred percent this game. i mean, have you seen the hit short film dragonbored? some amount of stars that amounts to 5.",49.0
"i give this gamea 6/10. visuals are good for a bethesda game. story and writing are rather subpar, and the magic and combat system is not as good as morrowind. this is a decent game, however i reccommend morrowind for a much more challenging game with a far better story.",182.4
"super fun. never uninstalled. replay all the time.",205.3
"well where do i start...... this game was my first on steam, i have not clocked the hours other have but in the time i have played on here, i have modded the hell out of it and still cant find a mod i dont like. i have recently bought a number of games and still i find myself looking on the steam workshop for skyrim and looking at new mods to try. i have never completed the main quests and i have not touched the dlcs in full but what i have seen and found will remain with me forever. this game ruin ur life and intrests but i promise you know, its all worth it.",89.7
"eric clapton - cocaine now back to the review; good game, dragons, swords, and a whole medieval vibe. the one setback is the lack of eric clapton - cocaine. thanks for your time.",9.6
"best game in the series in my opinion. still has some kinks to work out, but very enjoyable and easy to jump into and just go, something the other tes games tended to falter with. the action is fast, the story is good and the world is incredibly immersive and beautiful.",471.7
"this game never gets old. the more you play it, the more fun it is. there is so much freedom of choice. you can choose to be good or evil, support a rebellion, or help the empire regain control, be a philanthropist or a mass murderer.",136.9
"skyrim is in a way fun, yet boring. it has tons of sidequest litteraly and weapons to collect and enemies to fight. many diffrent roles you could be such as theif, ranger, warrior, mage or more. now when you are trying to travel to solitude or other major cities it can get quite boring and time consuming even when your riding a horse, which is hard for begginers to gain money to buy one. furthermore the difficulty is quite hard with followers. if your looking for adventure or a timeconsuming games then buy it. now if your a fan of fantasy titles such as final fantasy or legend of zelda dont buy it its not for you but for me it is good. 8/10",32.6
"this game has provivded 300+ hours of fun and i havnt even beet all the missions so much fun",355.6
"absolutely astonishing. unfortunately its also frustrating at the same time. even the tiniest bugs really disrupt my style of play (ive played the same character for a little over 2 years, over 400 in-game days). decided to start over because of it. and some of the bugs really arent that tiny (unification quests camp missions). other than the bugs its near perfect. afaik theres no other game that allows such immersion. at times its just breathtaking to stroll around in the mountains, or at the northern coasts glaciers and hear the ice crackle (which at first made me jump at my seat, or as it were at the time, crom dive for his life). hearthfire is really the best part: no other game has yet allowed to actually build a home with your own hands, more or less to your specification. the overall feeling imho is: this could only get better.",587.7
"best game ever no matter how times you play it makes you come back for another play through.",14.5
"i have played this game for almost 140 hours and have still not discovered half of the game. 10/10",246.9
"do i recommend this? i think the question is why have you not purchased this yet. buy it. now.",148.5
"when i first got this game back when it first came out, i got it for 89.99 and every cent was worth it. this game looks amazing, its open world or you could play only the story quests and make it more straight foward, and if you get bored go kill everybody in windhelm (or steal a horse and go run around pretending youre playing gta winter edition. do pretty much whatever you want, no strings attached... adise from the prologue but you should be used to that in every other game these days. if you want guns, im sure theres a mod (havent used any yet) if you want more areas, mods. and thats another thing mods, there are heaps that give you new weapons,armor,quests,abilities, you can even have randy savage as a dragon... macho man randy savage as a f**king dragon. buy now!",60.2
"skyrim is a modern marvel, a fantastic game in an era of dull games. i recommed this game to any and all. while i personally still prefer oblivion due to my preference for generic fantasy, skyrim is still quite simply stunning. modding makes this experience even better. skyrim is far from a perfect game of course, no game is perfect. there are more than a few bugs and glitches that abound in this game. but the community has take care of most of them by now. the whole appeal of the elder scrolls is being able to be whatever you want to be, and thats what this game provides in spades.",1255.9
"best game of all time! omg!!!! you have to see it to believe it. insanity!",413.5
"its like fallout but with magic, more epic environments and landscapes, improved graphics, amazing soundtracks, huge world to explore, etc. fallout is epic as well, but this game goes beyond that. everything that is good, this game has it!! except for the freaking spiders which has become a nightmare for me. yes, im arachnophobic. i know that there are mods to replace it but im a bit lazy at the moment. :| my rating: 10/10",130.9

"possibly the best game i have ever played in my life. 10/10 would buy again for full price. my only question is, i seem to have somehow acquired the dawnguard dlc without ever purchasing it. i didnt torrent it or anything like that, one day it was just...there, on the game. i have no explanation for it. i love the dlc and think it is a must have addition to the game, i just was curious about why i know have it for some reason. has anyone else experienced this?",118.8
"i do believe its obvious to say that anyone that is a fan of the elder scrolls wont be too disapointed by what skyrim has to offer. from discovering unmarked caves and forts, to the games storyline, even to the odd things weve come to expect in games by bethesda (npcs walking in the air, projectiles launching people thirty feet away, placing npc bodies in awkward positions), the game will give you the chance to kill a couple of hours. and lets not forget the modding commuity. those people never fail to disappoint, and kudos to them all for the work they do. from the unofficial skyrim patches for bug fixes, to new and immersive weapons/armors, to ai adjustments and value tweeks to make the game a challenge for even the the most experienced and well-geared player, or even just to make the game even more amazing to look at, the work they do easily adds countless hours of additional gameplay thatll help you milk more enjoyment out of the game than steam sales milk money out of your wallet. edit: not responsible for any problems that may occur with the game if you decide to try out manually installing mods to improve your gameplay experience. remember, google is your friend in instances like this.",69.2

"their is not a lot to say for this game. it is by far the best open world rpg i have ever played. finally a worthy follow up to morrowind. the only minor complaint is that the whole world is set in skyrim, meaning that architecture is more mundane compared to cities in morrowind and even some structures from oblivion. it has some awesome cities, but nothing that tingled that eager for fantasy i have. cities like minas tirith from lord of the rings, most of the places in game of thrones and almost all cities from morrowind. they just feel like places that are out of this world. on the plus side. the musical score is amazing, lots of replayability as their are so many fractions, builds, quests, characters, places and stuff to do. even if you ever run out of vanila (base game + dlcs) things to do, you can load up the mods from the workshop or look at skyrim nexus that has even more mods. the graphics are suprime, such a great viewing distance while such a vibrant and detailed world, moving trees and foliage. the ambience is just awesome, so many creatures that scatter randomly through the land doing their things, insects, bird, fish, crabs so many to be named.",143.3

"when i first bought skyrim in 2011, it was the ps3 version (and dont get me wrong, that was an amazing experience!) but i had never gave the pc version a glance until late 2013 and i was amazed at how many of you actaully liked it better on the pc. so when christmas came around, i deleted my old skyrim save, and put it back in its case and gave it to my little sister who had wanted to play it for the past 2 years. after that, i went out and bought myself the pc version, and i dont regret my decision. its easily one of the best games on the pc that ive ever played and i wouldnt refund it...ever! so if your looking for a really good game that, practically, goes on forever...this is your game! youll have a blast with the dragons, creepy skellies, the epic mods for the game, secret areas, hidden items, and the quests in general (coughdaedriccough). i can almost guarantee you, that youll never get tired of this game.",60.5

"after all these years skyrim is still amazing and even if you add mods or not the game is such a great experince and if you enjoy free roaming doing what you want wen you want, or maybe joing a guild of thiefs or wizards im sure this game will have something you want or love",149.9

"i would not have recommended this game three years ago. however the mod community, lowered price and *excellent* expansion pack content make skyrim a must-own, and not for the vanilla experience. i will stand by my opinion that oblivion was better, especilly in the uniqueness of the quests it offered as opposed to find x in cave full of draugr, and dont get me started on the bs but the combat is better in skyrim argument since the same bad combat system is just hid behind fancy execution moves. but the expansion pack content is genuinely interesting and through modding ive made my game a hardcore and fast-paced experience that feels not unlike diablo, (to clarify thats in pure intensity and not literally like a dungeon-crawler). its disappointing to have to merely say the mods make this game but thats the harsh reality in this case. the expansion content however, as ive stated twice already, is high-quality and only emphasises how mediocre the vanilla game is. edit: also i would highly recommend playing this game with a controller. the character feels more weighty to me that way, although that could be personal preference - you will have trouble playing an archer that way.",384.0

"this game was absolutely incredible. a fine addition to the elder scrolls series. the entirety of the game is breathtaking and deep to where you get completely wrapped up in the environment, lore, and characters.",141.9
"like a few other people, i honestly thought elder scrolls were crap. the things id seen didnt look good, so i formed an opinion prior to playing the game. thankfully, im happy to report that after buying oblivion, the game prior to skyrim, i was proved so incredibly wrong. the games have so much to offer that theyre damn near perfect. the odd thing i wish would be different, but those things are minor, that the pros vastly outweigh any con i could come up with, and with the modding community, any con i could come up with is being solved, bringing it closer to the absolute perfect game. while my playtime isnt high on steam, i do also own skyrim for the 360... and ive logged probably a good 500 hours or so there playing through everything. and even though ive played through everything, it just doesnt get old. you can play and reply this game countless times, lose hours, days, weeks and months exploring this beautiful world. and if you have the expansions, it gives you even more places to explore. i cannot rate this game highly enough, and i would recommend it to absolutely anyone who loves rpg games. if you dont want to read all that above... simply put, this is a must have title for any fan of rpg games.",214.1

"skyrim + nexusmods or steam workshop = all the reason to get the game already if you already own the game on a console, get the pc version anyway, it is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better. if you can get the legendary edition, do it, its totally worth it. but seriously, this game is amazing and its a must for everyone who plays games, and for everyone who doesnt. although i will say, beat the game first, then mod the hell out of it really the biggest downsides to this game are that you cant attack while jumping or swimming (i am dissappointed about this, because you could in oblivion, but its not a deal breaker), if you mod it too much it may crash (sucks, but luckily you can uninstall mods, and most modders are good at saying what mods are buggy), and..... um............ .....actually thats kind of it story is alright (although you kind of organically create your own story in this world, more with mods) , graphics are good (breathtaking with mods), content is plentiful and expansive (even more with mods), and it good sandbox fun (even more fun with mods), and mods (and more mods) just get it, play it, mod it, play it more, mod it more, crash it, mod it less, have fun! this game scores a limit breaker out of 10 it is a masterpiece, it is a classic, it is a shining example, and blah blah blah, its legendary!!!!!!!",192.1

"first off, its a great game, it would be stupid to deny it, but if youve had some issues with morrowind and oblivion (and even fallout 3), they havent been fixed. the animations are still awkward, the combat ai is stiil fight or flee, without any variation or tactics needed. i dont care about the main story as its a sandbox, but the dialog is abysmal. the balance later in the game crawls into a hole and dies, making the game quite dull the farther you get. and as with any bethesda title, there are bugs everywhere. but its still fun to play and when the community starts churning out mods, its gonna be amazing. as someone who hated oblivion before it was cool to hate it, i say i had fun with skyrim. get it when its on sale.",130.3

"well. it doesnt get much more thu-umingly good than this. skyrim in pc is a waterfall of fun - the game itself boasts a 94 in the metascore, and theres so damn much to be getting on with in skyrim! the atmospheric views and daunting enemies make this game cash-worthy, and the ability so shout - rather loudly - as a dragon can is pretty unique, and brings skyrim to the table as a worthy rpg contender. graphics? theyre a little demanding, but the ultra settings are a different story - bringing the best graphics to an rpg ive ever seen. such a good game - especially with mods. brilliant. buy it. be the dragonborn.",443.9
"i absoloutely hate this game and that is why i have not under any circumstances managed to put in almost 200 hours on the steam version and 150 hours on the xbox version. i dont recommend the workshop items because they only make the game even better and i cannot possibly recommend on more than several occasions that everybody should probably own this game.",270.5

"this was ome of the games i upgraded my pc to play, having wasted days of my life to the xbox versiion. which does not even hold a candle to this . the base game is brilliant the dlc is good but its the mods that make this game a keeper and truly add to its replability if you dont own this, you should .",45.3

"do i really have to say how much i luve this game? ive been streaming it at least 80 hours and invested even more time in it. i love the elder scrolls and this is their masterpiece so far. (though im missing the 8bit-sounds from tes 2...)",199.1

"best played with prostitution mods i havent visited  since",70.7
"i waited forever to get this game for some reason, and while i didnt think it would be my thing, i still gave it a try. loading up the hd pack and downloading the unofficial patches to fix a bunch of known issues, i started and ended up having a good time. the mod community provides enough material for you to restart the game a few times, with additional missions, lands, weapons, npcs, and the like. its a lot of fun, and if you havent tried it, you should pick it up and have fun.",155.7
"i dont know where to start. ive had this game on ps3 for years now and i played it so much. i have no idea how many hours i have on this game. i got it on pc because i liked it so much, and ive got to say it is probably my favorite game. ive done just about evrything in it and i am modding now. i strongly recommend this game. it is amazing!",510.6
"very good game, you will get many hours out of this. it does suffer from bugs and not so good storyline, but most of the bugs can be fixed with mods and many mods that adds more quests and improve some quest. absolutely worth the money and dont regret buying it one second. one of the best games around!",558.7
"the base game is fantastic, the world is wonderful and large and with lots of things to do. you can hunt the wildlife, catch butterflies, or mercilessly kill entire bandit camps and slay dragons. and occasionally follow a talking dog or other incredibly random thing. and then there are the mods, which seriously just turn the game into a whole other beast. combine the two and you literally have a never ending role playing experience.",139.7
"doesnt live up to the fanboys ball sucking reviews of bethesdas games, bout 50 hours game time before you will get bored but thats enough game time and fun for the price of zee game 7/10",159.6
"ive said this amidst all the hype when it was initially released and ill say it now; its not as good as oblivion. its still great, i love it. the addition of wyverns fills the void of lacking variety in the environment. ive not played the dlc but it allegedly adds a lot. i recommend it.",22.2
"fus roh dah! a masterpiece of gaming. will go down in history as defining a generation of games.",99.8
"tes v:skyrim used to be my favourite game. however, as i kept playing for hours and hours, over and over, one thing became clear. this game does not deserve to be called an rpg in my opinion. like so many others, this game gives you a few miniscule choices followed by rather boring combat as you progress.i like my rpg choices to actually change the gameplay. in my opinion the major choice is *spoiler* the choice between the grand cyrodiilian based empire or a puny rebellion. other than an initiation, the war goes exactly the same from that choice. i did enjoy the details that the designers put in such as the literature and history but lineal gameplay irks me.",50.9
"one of the greatest games ive ever played. seriously. and ive played just about everything.",169.9
"elder scrolls v is everything you would want in a open world, role playing game. highly recommend",66.4
"well i got to start reveiwing at some point the game may be a few years old but it is still fun to play the exploring a huge facter is the mods the modding community has really kept this game alive it makes every thing from bunny follower to just funny swords like a giant popsical it has apsects of a mmo like the role playing mounted combat the freedom you have getting married oh then getting divorced freedom right? xd crafting is fun even better with mods when you can crafy stuff like spartan armour assasins creed armour, even a darth vader helmet the game is endless of what you can do if you put your mind to it like i even a pregnant npc mod o_o as i said it is endless in what you can do :)",118.7

"this game is very fun! i have always liked it on consoles and have beaten it on there, but i bought it on pc for the summer sale. you can do much more on the pc, it doesnt take forever to load, it looks prettier, and you can run mods on it. this game is a great rpg and is worth the money. (i would get it before the steam sale is over for a simply 5 usd)",34.2

"this game is a unbelieveable adventure, even if you havent played the older elders scrolls games it doesnt matter. there are some inside jokes, that you might not understand unless you have played the older ones (maiq im looking at you). with the addition of steam workshop you can mod this game very easily to increase the graphical fidelity, or add more quests, although the main quest, is already excellent and the sidequest are great. the graphics on their own are good, but not great. but remember were looking at a 2 year old game so the graphics, arent at 2013 level. with the addition of dawnguard and dragonborn you can add two whole new questlines which both you can affect like the main games quests. pros: quests are great. even after completing the main quest line, you will have a lot of interesting side quests. the attention to detail is amazing. the world levels with you, after you break a certain level you will see new enemies. cons: voice acting isnt the strongest part of this game; the same voice actors are recycled from character to character. the graphics arent the best, but remember, were looking at a 2011 years game.",680.3
"you need to buy this game and all the dlcs. its really cheap and its the best game ever made!",181.4
"this game to me, is the best game ever produced in any category and any age. there is no equal to this game, not even close. if you want to get immersed in a world where you can do pretty much anything you feel like, then this is the game for you. what makes this game so awesome is not only the scenery but the easy way of getting around and quick interchangable functions, for example the 1st to 3rd person swap is simply a mouse roll and back, if you feel like it. and not to mention the thousands of mods and add-ons for those who want a different look or feel. i played this for over a year before i even touched a mod, because yes it is that good even in vanilla mode. playing different characters, doing different missions (not including the main steering objective), i can see anyone young or old playing this game for years. not bad for a single player game, which i would admit is probably the only downside to this game. i recommend this to everyone, young or old! but do get the complete game with dlcs and add-ons, or get the legendary edition which contains everything. its imperative that you have all of them.",220.9

"if you want to say: hey, i just finished skyrim then dont play this game. you dont finish skyrim because it is a world, not a game. almost all of the secondary quests are amazing, some of them are also as good as the main quest. you can have a lot of different playstiles like half mage half warrior, marksman assassin... also, the number of mods that there is in nexus adds a lot more variety to the world. i just love this game, sometimes i enter skyrim just to go to falkreath mounted on arvak and sleep at the dead mans drink at night and then i just go kill some dragons and clear a big dungeon. i love this game, 100% recommended ah...the life of a hero.",391.7

"so this year on the steam summer sale i spent over $100 in games, and i can honestly say that out of all these games, this is the best one. i never liked this on console and never got into it but i love it hear. so many mods to make it realistic and beautiful. i highly reccoemend. plus there is a free hd content dlc, just click the down arrow for the dlc packs. if you ever need help in this game contact me",39.6

"super fun open world game. i have not much to say about this game since it speaks for itself... awsome, its fun, action packed and lets you be who you really want to be.. a stealthy wizard? or perhaps an assualt bowman? your choice in the wonderful land of skyrim. game also has a nice modding community that is still going now, brining you back to keep playing this great game",181.8

"there are nearly endless opportunities in skyrim. i played it on the console before buying the legendary edition for pc, so i knew what i was getting. the ability to mod the game makes for even more customizations and adventures. amazing story? check. amazing graphics (with texture dlc)? check. customizable? check. not needing to be connected and play with idiot teenagers? check. tl;dr: worth it. buy it.",234.0

"skyrim... need i say more?... for those very very very few people who are unaware: brutal melee combat, magic of many flavors, the ability to do both at once, amazing graphics, amazing storyline, amazing character depth, amazing lore, breathtaking scenary, open-world, dragons, and lets not forget the amazing super cool ability to make a torch bashing naked argonian(lizard-man) that just boss modes, and the ever wonderful mod support!... probably so many more pros too little space to list them... so lets move on to cons: no co-op... seriously, thats it... tldr: if you do not own this game, buy it now. and if you do, buy it for your wife(seriously its that good).",189.2
"this game is truly great. 1. free roam rpg: not much video games are like this, especially with the wonderful graphics skyrim has to offer 2. creation kit: a tool that comes with skyrim. such as... if you were getting tired of the game and you are absolutely over powered, you can create your own npcs, dungeons, and items and customize them. once you are done, you can upload them to the steam workshop to show other people your newest creation / mod. 3. choices: you can have an amazing amount of choices in skyrim. you can become a mage, warrior, theif etc... and with that, you can apply your skills in-game and play in the game 4. add-ons (dlc) hearthfire: you can get married, adopt children and freaking make your own house! dawnguard: you can become a vampire, learn about skyrims history and uncover amazing ancient artifacts dragonborn: you can learn more about ancient nords, the dragons and dragonborn in this game. dawnguard lets you travel to different places that were unaccessable before installing the content. (same with dragonborn dlc) 5. abilities: in skyrim you can cast magic (destruction spells, conjuration spells - my favorite- and more), have recreational skills (speech, smithing, etc...) or fighting skills (archery, one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons etc...) this game is truly remarkable. you should really consider buying it.",116.1

"skyrim is just one of those diamonds found in a pile of ruble. the elder scrolls is by far my favorite rpg franchises of all time, words cannot describe how much i am in love with this game, only a couple of hours in and my quest log is filled with interesting quests to do, i just put the main story quest a side and started doing the side quests, which is very rare from me, i usually just play the main quests in an rpg. 16 hours in and i became the listener for the dark brotherhood, and got a red eye badass looking horse called shadowmere. the amount of mods from the amazing community that keeps the game fresh just like the moment you almost got your head chopped off in the intro section. the amount of sheer content being pumped into this game by fellow modders is astonoshing. even with custom quests the vanilla game has so much that it feels like the game is updated every single minute. i have never played a game with so much content and i love it. thank you bethesda for keeping true to the franchise, not like that horrible titleelder scrolls online. this game is my escape goat to a bad day. 10/10. flawless",39.3
"this game is great, i played it on xbox for a while until i switched to pc. once i bought it on steam and downloaded some mods it was the funnest game experience ive ever had, after i got over some v-sync issues, and visual terring problems i spent hours playing. overall i would definitely reccomend this game.",27.8
"if youve played the earlier elder scrolls series morrowind and oblivion then skyrim you will love the game is set in the next land called skyrim you are captured and sent to the block for crimes sort of unknown to the player, but things take a turn for the worse when a dragon destorys the village and you use this to escape from being killed. it is here you are giving the chance to explore the beautiful world of skyrim and meet all different kinds of folk and become the hero to save the world of skyrim. the combat is fairly the same with an improved leveling up system the world looks amazing but the added bonus is the steam workshop where people around the world have created mods to enhance the game or add things to make the world of skyrim even better. there are litery 100s of mods to choose from from the workshop as well as the 3rd party app nexus mod manger which have also has 100s of mods to make your experience better. the game is great edition to the series and you can be spending around 100 hrs+ because there is that so much to do.",24.3
"well, skyrim... what can i say. more content and more possibilities to enjoy a huge game are hard to be found. the battle systems not something that got too much love back from gamers, but the games definitely worth a playthrough or two.",64.3
"if youve played at least some of tes iv: oblivion, youre bound to almost completely love this one. it has almost everything great about oblivion... but with way better graphics. and dragons. if youve never played the series games before, its about time for you to grab yourself a copy and immerse yourself in all the wonders tamriel has to offer.",34.1

"amazing... i know this game was released a fwe years ago but i dont think its too late. the ai (guards villagers etc.) are extremely reactive and tough. combat is just stunnuing and the realistic graphocs... oh dem graphics. i would reccomend you buying this game if you are into fantasy games but it there is one downside: the large map!!! the map is huge it takes hours to cross it and some of the quests require it. buy this game!!!!!!",10.3

"great sandboxey, but the main story gets bogged down in giant boring nonsense that youve seen a few thousand times. all the extra stuff is more interesting and engaging. i was actually sad when i had nothing but the main quest left and couldnt be bothered finishing it there. but that was still 80 hours running around, reading books, meeting people, getting involved in weird little quests. just, bleh on the main story. but who really just does the main story in these?",78.6
"the one game where you have your own adventure and can eat your sweet roll too! soo many mods and so many customizations and options to go through for this game its ridiculous. definetely recommended",58.7

"get it on sale, beat it as fast as you can, then hope bethesda doesnt rush the next one. dlc was well crafted, more extensive than you would think, but completely failed to capture my attention or even do much that modders hadnt already done. vannilla game will provide at least 30 hours of quality entertainment before you discover the ridiculous bugs, the millionth fetch quest, and everything gets stale.",408.1

"after over 120 hours of play over 3 different consoles i still havent discovered half of the content within this title; not to mention not touching a single expansion pack yet. this game is simply the finest example of an open world rpg. it never feels padded or empty due to the sprawling vibrant world whilst the combat, admittedly simplistic, gives enough variety and progression to keep you playing long into the night.",60.8
"even though this game is old its one of the best ive played reccomend it very much !",99.5
"skyrim is a open-world rpgesk game. the graphics of the game are now out-of-date and the combat system is too easy for hardcore gamers. the story is bad, the factinos are plain and their quests are basicly this: oh you know our best infiltrator couldnt get it! lets send this new recruit! or go kill these bunch of targets because we wannt to just sit around in our hideout and fap etc. the soundtrack is good but it gets boring after 100+ hours. all of this can be fixed with mods (not the story of factions and main tho) i installed the requiem mod and the combat/skill system was overhauld to perfection! dlc like storymods are also out there with my personal favrout: falskar. purchase at your own will",210.1

"this is one of the best games in my steam library, and i have some pretty good games. lets get the worst out of the way first. (theres not much) it can get a little repetitive when it comes to dungen raiding, but thats only if you never change your play style. some of the animations are a little sketchy, but thats only compared to todays games. now that thats out of the way, lets get to the good stuff. this game is amazing. the world is huge and has so many places for you to explore. its got all of the things you need to rp if thats your style. (inns, carriges, fancy clothes, random items, ect.) it is a full on rpg with a skill tree for everything you could think of. (pickpocketing, lockpicking, archery, 2 handed, 1 handed, being a god**mn werewolf, ect.) its got so many quests that you probibly wont ever find them all without using a guide. the playtime on this game is the longest on any game i have ever played excluding mmos. it seems the only thing this game is missing is online multiplayer. if all of that is not enough for you, there is also a huge selection of mods in the steam workshop for you to add to your game and make it even more extensive. there is everything from lord of the rings weapons to flaming horses to thomas the train dragons in the workshop. what are you waiting for!? buy this game! 10/10 would write a super long review again.",24.2

"skyrim hardly needs a recommendation, but here goes: i have always liked the elder scrolls games, but i havent always liked playing the elder scrolls games. i still have my boxed copies of arena and daggerfall, and memories of endless patching. i never got anywhere much in morrowind, and oblivion just kind of lost me. skyrim expertly tickles that lizard part of my brain that likes exploration. no matter how much you wander -- and 40 of my 48 hours in-game have been wandering -- theres still something new to see, guaranteed. i havent even been to three of the major towns of skyrim yet. ive walked past countless towers, ruins, fortresses and caves. my journal is full of abandoned quests i wish i could move to a seperate section so i never felt a twinge about well, maybe, since i said yes, i should go and do that. and yet still i want to wander and find more stuff to do. i think this must be what crack cocaine is like. later edit: definitely not crack cocaine because suddenly, 58 hours or so in, my brain decided: nope! dont want to do this any more! and i stopped. still, how many games do i ever play for almost 60 hours? none, thats how many.",63.4
"wonderful, wonderful game. everything it was hyped up to be. with the ability to mod this game (on pc), this game really has so many possiblities and extras that will have you playing over and over again. there really arent many games that have the type of re-playability that skyrim has (even if its not modded), and thats what makes this game incredible. its arguably one of the top games of all time.",410.4
"10/10 very fun and alot of content! ive been playing on my orc for abot 10-15 hours and i only went to about 10% of the map! you can chose your own path! warrior,mage,theif and archer (if this even counts as one)",290.9

"yet another great title from bethesda! the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a feat of its own. an immersive world, coupled with grand scenery and exploration, this game is a complete marvel. besides lightning, everything is at your fingertips in this game. customization, gameplay, graphics, exploration. it is almost impossible to spend less than 50+ hours in this game. a variety of quests, weapons, armour, spells, locations, and secrets, skyrim is a world you almost wish you lived in..besides the terrain dotted giants and ice-frosted trolls. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -gameplay 4/5 -customization 5/5 -graphics 5/5 -exploration 5/5 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- last but not least, the community. there are so many mods for this game it literally adds hundreds of hours on top of what youre most likely to spend playing the game itself. custom quests, dialogue, gameplay elements, weapons, armour, graphical tweaks, and fun mods make this game a 99/100 in my book. totally worth the full price, sale or no sale. get it, you will not regret.",86.9

"this game while it has great aesthetic appeal, is just.... boring. i really mean it. maybe im spoiled from other great games over the years, but coming from a fan of rpgs, the story is lacking, the characters are lacking, its predictable, i found myself hardly able to really immerse myself in this world through all of its weird inconsistencies, lack of true impact from any of the story lines or guild quests at all. so from that aspect really, i feel there are other better games out there. if you want a fantasy action game, skyrim is far from it, it really feels like they didnt even play test it, cuz its really boring, really fast, lacks any variety, even on the hardest difficulties, and for the game to be challenging at all, or have any sort of variety i had to go out of my way to increase the difficulty be it through mods or other means. if you want an rpg, go to the witcher or something else, if you want an action game.... well theres a long list. if you want a mediocre experience of both, then... here ya go",53.4
"one of the few games i go back to again and again. the ability to install mods and maps via the workshop means that even if you park this game for a few months and come back, you can easily add more content via the press of a button, also allowing the difficulty curve to be tailored to suit for combat, exploration, or simply loot hording.",182.2
"its a sandbox action game. some how besthesda managed to strip out the role playing from the game even further than they did with oblivion. good as a hack and slash fantasy game. bad as an entry in the tes series.",34.6

"words cant express how good this game. i originally bought it on console but later purchased it on pc for the modding community. if you have never played an elder scrolls game, you owe it to yourself to play this game.",41.3
"ill try and keep this brief. two points here: one, despite my logged steam hours in this game, i have appoximately 300 hours logged on the 360 version. that said, you can only assume this game is either crack cocaine, or highly addictive--or both, depending. two, this game set the standard for what tactical next-gen rpgs should be. when i see any mention of a sandbox rpg, im sure im not the only one to immediately compare it to skyrim (or fallout 3, respectively)--and appropriately so! skyrim is almost the perfect video game in that you can make it your own, from start to finish. you can get a sense of accomplishment one minute, and unwarranted terror the next! its possible to feel completely immersed at times, as this game aims to take you beyond what its predecessor, oblivion could or did. as i mentioned previously, i own this game (an all dlc) for the 360 console. however, seeing it priced at $13.49 for the entire bundle, i bought it up in case i wanted to give it another play-through. this is not the 360 version. this is a crisp, clean, rich, immersive, visually-ic variation of the 360 port. this really is what video games are supposed to be. go buy this .",32.0
"a great improvement over previous elder scrolls games. the faces werent creepy ( just a bit squareish ;p but thanks to the modding community that we can rule it out now ), and the dungeons felt suitably different. the enormous world has a lot of fun things no matter where you start looking, and the level system makes it possible to build a large variety of characters without the risk of making an inept character that existed in previous games. there are a large number of points in the game where the player is forced into a single course of action, or an event is triggered regardless of how you attempt to avoid it. this was annoying, but did not prevent me from enjoying the game :)",369.3

"its a good game to play if youve ever wanted to live in a fantasy world of adventure, and build your way to the top tier of awesome. all kinds of monsters, creatures, and people exist for you to fight, befriend, and protect. and, overall, it has a beautiful way of presenting the world to you. easy to pick up for new players to the franchise.",191.4

"the elder scrolls skyrim, i remember waiting soo long for this game to arrive... and when i got it i feelt kinda dissapointed... but i dont know, you get addicted very very soon. the good: beautiful landscapes, good storyline and greatly improved character apperance options, improved animations, mods. the bad: no dx11 even when bethesda promised it, no 64 bit application which the game is limited at 4gb of ram, series dumbed down... most of the time you cannot fail quests like in morrowind or oblivion, a ton of things were cut from oblivion like player character smiling/frownning and looking ar people as they pass by, dumbed down magic crafting system, no waves in the ocean/water as most sandbox open world games now a days, no birds, bad collisions, no flora collision as you pass by like in two worlds ii, not too many dlc from bethesda and not as many havok traps as oblivion... they just wasted resources in havok and not really used it that much appart from the generic stuff. my score for this game is 9.6 out of 10.",1164.5
"after putting in 100+ hours on the xbox 360 version, i still bought this game a second time through steam. even after 2 years since its release, im still loving this game. its just one of those games you can always go back to and find something new to try out.",90.7
"my most played game on steam, by far. amazing thorough storyline, seemingly infinite side missions (i probably havent even discovered them all) , and lastly the greatest mod community of all time, allowing you the range of simply tweaking a bow unsheath animation, to turning skyrim into a tropical desert (yes that exists), among thousands of other examples. the game is so unimaginably detailed it cant be criticized, there is something for everyone in this game, whether it be riding horses in a meadow or sacrificing the unworthy to a demon god, and everything inbetween. unlike any other game out there, price is not to be considered as a factor, you just have to get skyrim (if there isnt anyone left on earth that hasnt yet bought it)",506.3

"surely you mustve heard all the good stuff this game has to offer, yes? well dont go into this game expecting what youve heard. expect much, much more. every time your play skyrim youll notice something new. maybe a quest, item or even a simple little treat that either resembles something like an easter-egg, a whole set of missions, or even going on an adventure after a heavy night of drinking finding out what the hell you did in your drunkness the day after. the game is almost limitless! oh and i didnt even mention the dlc. hands down: the best dlc ive come across in any game so far (the only exception being bioshock infinite: buried at sea). 9.5/10, almost perfect. the absolute only flaw this game seems to have (on me at least) is that the game gets a bit repetitive. this can be fixed pretty easily however if you simply download some of the mods from the steam forum. i rated the base game but with the workshop included this is a perfect 10/10 solid title. buy it. do it nao! *plz episode 3 confirmed?*",86.6
"this game is great value for money - especially with the three added dlcs of dragonborn, dawnguard and hearthfire. it can be a bit annoying to arrive back in whiterun and be instantly hacked to pieces by vampires, however, they do have some great kit that you can nick off them once youve given them the good news. being able to choose between following the set storylines or just wandering around the world aimlessly gives many variables to ones gaming experience, and of course the plethora of mods just adds nice customised play. having the mods easily accessible via the steam workshop is highly convenient. awesome game, awesome experience - play it now!",101.6
"skyrim is one of those games, which make you feel proud, playing it. hundreds of quests, that are not nonsense-quests, but have a story. many factions which make you feel special. whats very important is to travel around on foot or by horse, because you have to discover this huge world and its sidequests that are pretty thrilling.",55.9
"my first elder scrolls game, and probably the best one to date. i played it twice through on my ps3, when there were lots of lagging issues. re-bought the legendary pack for pc and love the modding capabilities for the game. its very pretty, the stories are pretty good, and the freedom to do what you want when you want is awesome. sandbox games are very good and this is one of the best.",142.3

"in 2014, it is quite obvious that skyrim is a great game, and also a game you have to test/play if youre interested in rpgs. so i wanted to write a critic a little deeper than wow, great game. despite his high qualities, i think that skyrim is also poorer than morrowind regarding gameplay, because it was adapted for xbox and ps, and the gameplay of morrowind was able to be deeper because it was on computer. anyway, the story and quests are as great as they were in morrowind, but i think they are easier, especially because of the map marker. in morrowind, to locate a moutain, or a donjon was sometimes uneasy, because you had to ask people if they knew it, but in skyrim, i feel the developpers show you well, you have to go there, and after do this, so i feel less freedom than morrowind to find places. graphically, skyrim is really beautiful, and the characters too - it was not in morrowind or oblivion. landscapes were handsome, but characters, without mods... i really appreciate that skyrim is really in the storylines of the elder scrolls - indeed fan players could find in the game many references to the other games. a pleasure to play.",110.8

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim, the absolute best elder scrolls game of the entire series. if you are one of the poor souls who never bothered to go buy this game, you made a huge mistake. at first, i didnt want to buy this game because i thought that it was just another stupid rpg. but bethesda game studios completely shattered my expectations for the game, and heightened them for future elder scrolls games. there is always something to do, and you can always do it your way. the way the story is set up allows you to make up your own story. be a high elf whos been working as an undercover agent for the aldmeri dominion since the third era, who uses the arcane arts to defeat her foes. or be a nordic rebel fighting for independence, in a raging civil war in which the stormcloak rebels are fighting the empire of tamriel. or, be neutral in the war, and be a silent sneaky khajit who uses the shadows and trickery to outwit his opponents. all of this while exploring dangerous ruins, capturing forts, fighting giant spiders and dragons, and so much morethis game is exciting, expansive, addictive, and you can play it over and over. the elder scrolls v: skyrim easily earns a 10/10. go buy this game, now!",609.4
"the epicness of this game is just unreal! and the mod workshop? intense! if only there was a workshop for oblivion and morrowind :)",372.1
"well, lets see, i literally lost my life to oblivion skyrims predecessor. so i had high hopes for this. very high hopes. im not really sure if they were fulfilled. but maybe they were unrealistic. it is huge i put 60 hours into in the first week. i ended up playing for 9 or 10 hours straight until damn near 4 a.m. it is bugged, but thats not fair to crucify the game for it. its huge and bugs are to be expected. i have not once ran into a game, or even a quest ending bug. not once im 60+ hours in. bugs are sometimes random and now a third patch was released so they are getting smaller and smaller. this game also has a huge modbase, one of which i am apart of. fighting isnt as fun as i had hoped but its still very good. quest and storyline is awesome and the leveling system is the best seen in an elder scrolls in my opinion. graphics let me down a bit, not dx11 support as of now, hopin they will soon but dx9 is still very good. i give this a 9.5/10 because of no dx11.",107.1
"i absolutely love this game. i have spent many hours playing it on the xbox360 and ended up buying it again on the pc so i could start trying all the interesting mods and hd rendering. this is a game that you can play over and over again and each time you play through it, it is an entirely different experience. only downside i can think of is there are a few questlines where you have an option to go one way or the other (i wont go into details to avoid spoilers) any one side is really well developed and interesting and the other falls short. there are only a couple of them where this applies though.",10.6
"a phenomonal game, few role-playing games can include such an enormous amount of content and have the player at no stage find it dull or repetitive. the immense size of skyrim is a testimant to the outstanding skill and talent bethesda has to offer. the visuals are excellent, the audio sets the right mood for any coming adventure and the unscripted soundtrack leaves shivers up ones spine. the gameplay is familiar but refreshing and the quests are immersive and interesting. bethesda has produced a role-playing game that leaves other developers shaking there heads in disbelief. this is another superb game in a catalog of an already numberous number of superb rpgs.",147.9
"probably the second best game ive ever played (1st being pokemon!!)",274.8

"i absoulutely love skyrim. i love it so much i own it on both console and pc. it is so easy to get immersed and you can look back at your progress and feel acomplished. the lore is so rich and relevant in the elder scrolls series that everything that is said, or anything you read has importance and value attatched to it. i feel those connections is what makes skyrim a model game to be compared with every new rpg to come.",15.4

"i love this game. simple as that. i love the midevil feel of it and the hole dragon idea is amazing. the fighting is a bit clunky but managable. the entire map is amazing and looks even better. the entire game looks beautiful. the spellcasting system is fun and the razees and super fun to mess with. i can wait for elder scolls iv and hope that it even better than this. overall i would reccomend this to anyone who likes midevil warfare, dragons, fighting, adventure, and a lot of fun.",116.6
"first of all i have to say that this is my first tes series game. i am big fan of j.r.r. tolkiens the lord of the rings and the hobbit series. playing this game i find a lot of similarities to the tolkiens middle-earth. in both series act is held in the fictional-universe, the world is huge and beautiful, there are many races which have their advantages and disadvantages (some of theme are strong, some of them are magicians and etc), the name of characters look similar and there ar dragons. i am not a big fan of rpg games, but skyrim charmed me because of its interesting story. one day i would love to see the skyrim movie.",14.5
"outstandingly tremendous piece of work. spent hours playing this awesome game. fudge yeah.",96.6
"this + texture/hd mods = a beautiful gaming experience. skyrim. get it.",369.2
"skyrim is a game weve all heard of. what makes it so great though? for me it was the sandbox. the being able to do anything when i felt like it. i didnt need to level up to explore the map, i just started walking, or stole a horse. the combat seems simple at first, but by the time you get past your first few dragons it becomes complex and difficult as you encounter tougher foes. this is a great game, and i would recommend getting it if you love sandboxes, story, dungeon crawling, or open worlds. the dlc isnt needed for this to be a good game. i would recommend getting dawnguard though because it adds a good chunk of content. if you love having a big house and doing housing stuff, get the hearthstone! the dragonborn dlc isnt very big to me, and you can get everything you need or could want without it. the modding community is still kicking strong and there are plenty of mods to make the game even better. though there is still room for a few more.",395.3
"there simply hasnt been a game as anticipated as tes v: skyrim. the latest entry in the 17 year old series, skyrim brings the same free form rpg formula the series is known for and brings it into current generation hardware. skyrim is more than a graphical upgrade, though. by removing the character stats and classes, skyrim allows true freedom in play style by allowing characters to form based on what actions the player does the most. any skillup contributes to level progression and a perk system allows players to excel at skills and learn new abilties without the need for stats or classes. couple this with a world with so much to do and see, and its easy to see why this game is so loved.",145.4

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"skyrim carries on from the legacy of morrowing and oblivion, presenting the player with a dynamic, open world that will entirely consume you. the overall tone of the game is more serious than its predecessor, but still retains good portions of humour and a hugely enjoyable and immersive storyline. dungeons have been revamped brilliantly (no more same-y instances like in oblivion), and the new game engine handles character interaction much more subtly. if you can afford it, skyrim will not disappoint!",444.0
"- installed - loaded in - created character - did all the intro quests - talked to jarl of whiterun - noticed that i could use console commands - turned off my auto-save feature - spawned 500000 cabbages - game crashed - loaded back in - sees that i cant continue my game - creates another character cabbage/500000; would over throw whiterun with cabbages.",16.4
"so skyrim....this is one fun game. on the basic of the game you are a young dragonborn and you are off on an adventure. an adventure to save skyrim. this game has a variety of things to do, so much you wont be bored. in this open world you can do anything that you want. if yu want to complete the story of the game go ahead, go to caves and find riches go ahead, be the leader of the dark brotherhood go ahead. this game is meant for fun and it does a good job of it. you are able to chose your destiny in skyrim, your play style everything is up to you. you like cheats? go ahead no one will judge its your game do whatever you want. once you get the game you wont stop, and you will be glad you got this game.",87.4

"im a completionist, something that is quite a challenge with the elder scrolls games series. skyrim is a dream come true for my play-style: free form, free roaming, play and discover. i love getting lost in skyrim and discovering new places, side quests and what not. really one of my all time favorites and highly recommended!",249.0
"to ye who gaze upon this review, if this game is on sale (hell, if it isnt, either), buy it now. steam says i only have about 400 hours into this game, but i actually have well over 3000 hours into it. not only is this the most expansive open world game i have ever played, it is also the game that kept me sucked into its world the longest. even if you have done every single thing in the entire game (even after my play time, i havent), there are 3 awesome expansion packs and a massive modding community to get into. if you are looking for a last minute christmas present, this is the one.",397.9
"if you like big booty es like i do. i recommend this game.",542.3
"the most amazing game ive ever played. with many interesting quests and even random events that lead to quests that lead to another its endless fun. with many places to be discovered with many enemies along the way to kill. also the dlcs are very cool adding even more quests and just stuff!",123.4
"this game is the most realistic single player world to explore for a game that deals with fantasy.",686.7
"the biggest (and one of the best) game i have ever played. you can do almost everything here and when there is something restricted by developer you can turn to awesome mod community. you have here wide, nice looking world full of sidequests to finish, monsters to defeat, animals to hunt, locations to discover dungeons to explore,... the only downside for me are puzzles. im not a big fan of hard ones but for gods sake if you make a puzzle dont show solution so obviously. this is the first tes which got me. maybe i should give other games in series second chance. i dont like it as much as for examplw final fantasy, but hell i want to spent more time in tamriel, a lot more.",124.1
"i played skyrim on the xbox and it is great. i love it even more on the pc. i highly recommend this game. get it!",3.5
"this game is so great, i love exploring and level systems so everything have a level... and i love skill branches... i love it, sob. in skyrim you dont have to follow the main quest if you want (but eeeh its neccessary) and i just... its so fun to just go around and see what youll find. one time i was in riverwood, and a dragon appeared just like that. and i paniced i was like ,  that i cant deal with a dragon right now. and i went into the inn... and the music was still playing, but muffled. and then i was like fine okay if the music keeps on playing and puts its ing belief in me then okay... ill do it. and i went out and the dragon was gone and everyone was dead. i looted everything, and got too much . and many times ive gone to kill a dragon, finding myself run away to a giant so the giant can kill the dragon instead. good times. i think a lot of people can find fun in this game, it has so much stuff in it. just... buy it.",47.2
"its fun, you could waste your whole life time on this, and probably still have fun/things to do.",74.9
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best games i have ever had the pleasure of playing. in my opinion it easily keeps up with the other games in the series, and one thing that makes this game better is the fact that the combat system feels less constricting and the movement just feels a lot more realistic. skyrim has everything that oblivion lacked, like modern graphics, a better combat system and more balanced races and a better spell-system, but however lacks one of my favorite features from oblivion; creating your own spells, although it has a wider variety of spells for the different schools. the story line is simply great and after finishing (or before?) the main story line you still have hundreds of hours fun left in this game, which gives it 10/10 stars from me.",132.0
"simply put, its one of the best games you can play right now. ive been exploring the map since launch and i still havent finished it. the graphics are breathtaking, the game is immersive, and the content is unbeleivable. all of the little quirks and issues with oblivion are gone .. many of the nice ideas from fallout have been incorporated in (ie. lock picking).",610.1
"this game is so awesome, it makes me want to cry with awesomeness, after putting in over 500 hours on the console version of skyrim and now time to put in even more hours on the pc version, i just... i cant even describe the epicness of this game, stop reading and buy it already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",8.1
"this game is epic in every way. of course you already know that by now unless youve been living under a rock these past years. seriously though if you havent played it and are a fan of roleplaying action than drop whatever your doing and give tes v: skyrim a playthrough. it will change your life.",419.7
".... what can i say about this game that hasnt been said already? ill keep it short. get the legendary edition with all the dlc. go to nexusmods and be careful with not modding them game into instability. then call your boss and quit your job. the best rpg of all time is here.",179.3
"if you havent got this yet, you are seriously missing out",173.3

"its true ive never played the previous games in the elder scrolls series but this one definetly makes me want to. even without mods this game is crazy. just do some quest chains, know which npcs to do side quests for and get your sneak well up and you rarely have to buy anything. the story itself is pretty interesting as well + the additional side stories and the dlcs; this does really give hours of things to do. some complain that theres a cap but im almost at 100 hours and still have a huge chunk of things to do, the trick is not to rush through the main story; this isnt that kind of game.",99.0
"i get bored easily in games, and usually their genre is rpg, or tps. but dude, this game! let me tell you this, nothing in this game is boring. just when i start to get bored a dragon appears from nowhere and cheers me up. not to mention random quest givers popup everytime. after 60 hours of gameplay i still have tons of quest in my list and i dont know which one i should choose next :) im not an old school elder scrolls fan, the first game of bethesda i played was fallout 3. i loved the game but couldnt play it, because it made me depressed. instead i watched my friend playing and i had so much fun. but in skyrim i dont have to worry about that. because the atmosphere is too damn cool. just look at that huge mountain or wow that city dude if you still wondering, stop and buy this game. get your coffee at 8 pm, and start playing. :)",59.1
"quite frankly, anyone that gives this game a bad review is a blatant liar or blind. this game is the pinacle of the elder scrolls series and is made in such a way that general and hard core es fans can love. if you are a max-min player you can make deadly one hit kill weapons and impenetrable armor (and then set it to hardest difficulty) or literally spend hours decorating the over 8! houses you can own the the game. the mods alone add litearlly hundreds of hours of non-repetitive play. this is the benchmark that all other rpgs should be set to. bethesda took their greatest strengths from fallout and implemented them into es. nuff said.",225.0

"to be honest, i never was a fan of skyrim, and never will. i mean it is a good game, open world sandbox, and you can running around doing stuff. but the thing is, i have no idea what the hell im playing, am i doing this right? where should i go? why the quest tells me to go back the place i just got out? did i missed something? overall, i think im more like a dragon age -type of player, a solid storyline really means a lot to me.",7.5

"skyrim is the fifth game in the elder scrolls series of rpgs. its an open world, western-style role playing game in which you assume a character that you create in a fantasy-type setting. you choose the charcters race (various types of human, elf, cat-person, lizard-person, etc) and its starting abilities. from there, you level up the character however you want, whether you want to specialize in stealth and stealing, bows, one-handed or two-handed weapons, or combinations therein. you also level up their health, stamina, and many other statistics, as you wander around the world. there is a main quest to complete, but much of the draw of the es games is that you can literally go wherever you want, completely ignoring the main quest, and many other paths open up to you. you can even become a vampire or a werewolf if you want, though both have their drawbacks. the game also changes and reacts to your different decisions. so if you want to play through again as a different character, with different abilities, you can do vastly different things and basically its like a whole new game. this game has a lot of content plus dlcs. steam workshop and mods bring a lot of different things and lots of replay value! highly recommended!",346.5

"i only recommend skyrim in pc version only because of mods. pc community mod is what makes this game great. i honestly dont get why console version gets so much praise because skyrim is well...  without mods. skyrim without mod is glitchfest, boring, and non immpersive. mod is a must in this game. i recommend going to nexus site for mods to check and see which mod has high score and subsribe them in steam workshop. though i recommend just using nexus site and program to get/organize all the skryim mods",127.7
"skyrim is packed with tons of exciting quests and interesting characters. it has hours of content within the game itself, but the dlc adds much, much more. definitely an improvement from oblivion; they weeded out some unnecessary features and added some awesome new ones. from the main storyline of ridding skyrim of dragons, to the simple side quests of getting your own home and spouse, this game is a must play.",93.6

"hours of entertainment right here. you dont already have it? get it bruh!",82.2
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",248.6
"decent game, but the pc version isnt without console-ridden features that annoy mouse/keyboard users like myself. hopefully a modder will address this issue. skyrim in no way threatens morrowind goty as my all-time favorite elder scrolls game. there is some fun to be had in skyrim but be warned its very streamlined and built for the masses instead of niche open world rpg lovers specifically. the price at $60 is a bit steep but you can get many hours out of this game, despite bugs and streamlining, and numerous annoying console-esque run-ins with the interface/menu.",1137.1

"skyrim is probably one of my favorite games. i have played it on the xbox, ps3, and pc, and all i can say is... wow. the game is great ; it has an awesome plot, graphics, and interesting mods. because however, i have played it on different consoles, it is annoying to have to restart, and then proceed to get through all the cutscenes and quests i have completed so many times before. but time and time again, i find myself dealing with the struggle and continuing where i left off previously, and strangely enjoying every minute of it. this game has a few flaws, but if you like rpgs, get this game now! 9.5/10",38.1

"i have over 200 hours of this game played and honestly it still pulls me back in. its a game that you can truly never finish but at the same time still be impressed and entertained even with 200+ gameplay hours. even though i feel like the elderscrolls 4: oblivion has more content and depth to the story line this game is still a solid 9 out of 10.",251.0

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"amazing... i know this game was released a fwe years ago but i dont think its too late. the ai (guards villagers etc.) are extremely reactive and tough. combat is just stunnuing and the realistic graphocs... oh dem graphics. i would reccomend you buying this game if you are into fantasy games but it there is one downside: the large map!!! the map is huge it takes hours to cross it and some of the quests require it. buy this game!!!!!!",10.3

"i love this game! for anyone who likes exploring games or dungeon crawlers this game is perfect. admittedly after a while some of the missions can get a bit same-y, but this is easily fixed with many many mods. one of the best games ive ever played: 9/10 without mods. 10/10 with mods",133.2
"i played this for 4 days it has been on the pc for a long time and now it wants me to buy it again",26.0
"skyrim excels in the open-world department. while the main storyline itself is great, it is the sheer amount of side quests and things you can do (rolling 1000 cheese wheels down a hill anyone?) that make skyrim what it is. with its included mod support, which is decent, although slightly unstable at times, there is almost no limit to what you can do in skyrim, and as a result, you can easily lose hundreds, if not thousands of hours in this game. the game is more than worth its price, and while i personally like all the official dlcs, you dont need to them in order to have a fulfilling gameplay. all in all, an awesome buy.",362.9

"this game is amazing because it gives you countless hours of stuff to do. you can install multiple mods that make the game a lot more better. graphic mods really bring out the beauty in skyrim and they have mods that can improve the civil war. i plan on playing hours more. the character creation allows you to create your own unique character. mods allow it so you can not be the dragonborn. one of the best games i have ever purchased and i will never regret it. gives you something to do when you are bored or have nothing to do.",117.6
"what can i possibly say that hasnt already been said ? this is possibly my favourite game that i have ever played. i cant find one single fault. immersion, story, characters, atmosphere, longevity - the list goes on. if you are one of the few that hasnt played skyrim then just do it now.",63.5

"i have played through this game mainly as a mage (but tried a couple of other forms for fun) and i still love it. i do find it helpful to get a few of the downloads from the workshop just to help make the game a little more liveable. one thing i found is that it is really helpful if you read some of the books etc that you pick up olong the way, some hold clues to quests and you will go.. hang on i remember reading that name somewhere.. and by looking through that particular book/story/poem you can find a clue to location/source/what the hell to do...lol. i keep coming back to this game every so often, add a few more levels, progress a bit further. it is such a rich enivronment and there are so many ways to progress you are not stuck to a linear story line progression but you can pick one line up.. do some, put it down and go do another and come back later... or not as you choose. love this game.. honestly and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves this type of world and this style.",98.3

"medieval simulator 2011. with dragons. 11/10. would play until the border between reality and skyrim shatters and melds into one. (no, but seriously. this is easily one of the most interesting and fun games of all time, due to its open-world style of questing and activity and immersive environment and features. really, the only downside is if your computer was too weak to run it, which in my case, is negligible. i would heartily recommend this to anyone who enjoys roleplaying games, first person games, or pretty much any action/adventure fan in general.)",84.7

"it goes straight to the main menu on start up instead of playing a long intro video like other games. also being able to switch between first and third person is nice. you can make your own character and shape them with whatever skills you wish. the only complaint i have is sometimes the npcs get in your way. other than that this game is absolutely amazing.",40.0

"among the best, most-complete gaming experiences i have encountered ever, let alone from bethesda (who have a reputation for releasing incomplete material). combined with the steam workshop and the other modding communities on the web, skyrim is still a powerhouse years after its initial release.",396.1

"had it for ps3 and xbox but know on pc this is much more fun and immersive with mods",186.4
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a wonderfully immersive and detailed game. there are so many choices available to the player, from exploring dungeons to getting married. the game is just so amazing, especially when you replace 90 percent of bethesdas own content and replace it with custom content. 10/10 would bang.",107.2
"hugely expansive. tons of excellent quests and items to get. i reccomend you take your time with this one. try not to fast travel and read the books you come across. basically take the time to take in the lore and the scenary. besides that the combat is fun and can be talored to your own playstyle and wishes. with the amount of content that has been added on the steam workshop you can further customize/expand the game. i have much love for this title.",277.1

"this game is way to cool i love the lore of the elder scrolls and this just makes me a happy camper plus the modding community is way to cool and thank you bathesda for the creation kit a lot of modders make excelent mods. this game has a lot of potetial. so yes i do recomend this game, my rating is the most epic game ever",507.0
"such an amazing game, only problem is no multiplay but elder scrolls online is coming out. but on a single player level it is utterly flawless!",27.6

"this game is absolutely amazing, there is a reason why its rated 94 out of 100!",23.7
"great game! played it first on the xbox. i played as a meathead mauler, then a battlemage. now that i have it on steam im playing as a pure mage, and am really looking forward to checking out the workshop. skyrim still looks good, and is really fun. however it is a time consuming game. spam save!!!! i cant tell you how many times ive been sucked into the gameplay forget to save, only to be killed by a spider or a mammoth. which i hilariously fun but instantly frustrating when you lose several minutes of gameplay",26.8
"note: this is a review on vanilla skyrim, i dont care if there are thousands of mods im reviewing the game as it is unmodded. pros: faces are a massive improvment from oblivion mountains and ruins look thousands of times better than oblivion, especially the mountains. music when fighting dragons is epic. the music overall is better than oblivions dragon fights are epicness archery is much more improved, its alot faster. pretty good storyline cons: coloring sucks balls. the grey atmosphere looks great on mountains but awful on lush forested places. melee combat system is more like press x to not die which you are basicly just spamming attacks with no strategy. npcs suck , theyre all the same, they all say the same thing to your character about the war. they never evolve to your character. they will treat a level 1 fur armored player the same way they would treat a level 50 dragon slayer savior of sovngarde player, except for a few comments guards will make about you but other than that they will all treat you the same all the time. i find the dungeons extremley repetitive and boring. each dungeon basicly looks the same as the last one except duplicated to look bigger. final verdict: 7/10, would recommend for 29 dollars but im nearly on the verge of not recommending it because the cons i listed really ruin the game.",291.1
"hey i wonder what this game is... *buys game* *boots it up* *70 years later* well i finnaly 100% percented it now what? i guess go outside. opens door looks at sun *instantley shuts door* well im done going outside *boots skyrim up again with mods* 10/10 would waste life again.",121.9
"one of the most intense, addicting, and expansive games ive ever played. if youre looking for something to spend 100 hours on, skyrim is your game. this is without a doubt the most you can get in a game for $60. i highly reccomend it to fantasy-rpg and open world fans.",213.0
"cant beat another elder scrolls game, a great time waster!",2.2
"i like this game, sad that i any game i have to buy to play, i have to download crack types, so i can play. i never have the money to buy things. which sucks.",82.1
"its a f***ing elder scrolls game. while it may not be perfect, its still pretty fantastic.",67.8
"if you even vaguely like rpgs, you should give skyrim a try. the scope and dangers of the game are epic, the landscapes breathtaking and unforgiving, and there is so much to do you can literally sink hundreds of hours in this game. it is also the most highly polished elder scrolls game to date, so it is an excellent starting point for beginners and series veterans will appreciate the refinements and new features. if you do not already have elder scrolls v: skyrim, you need to buy it now.",298.4
"excellent game, best in its genre. the modding community adds endless playability, 250+ hrs and still going. wonderful!",249.0
"i loved every second of it. its a game that you can play for weeks, months, maybe even years without getting bored. pros: awesome fun. fulfilling game. one of the best ive ever played. cons: few, none game related, time required to play, it can get consuming.",278.3

"you will get tired of this game, and eventually forget about it for a while to play others, but you will always come back. there is always something you want to do and you cant help but play a little bit here and there. complete quests youve done half a hundred times, just because you enjoyed them, run around in your favourite dungeons and get hungry by staring at the brightly coloured food you cooked. then youll shout lydia off high hrothgar again and quit for a while longer. but you know youll come back. youll always come back.",571.6
"this game is an amazing rpg. with the fixed leveling system compared to the previous games. 10/10 in my books. you can hybrid classes extremely well in this game and has very fluent lore all in all.",419.4
"does anyone honestly need to read a review before purchasing this game? if youre undecided on buying this game, then this is probably your first game purchase ever.",151.2
"i totally recommend this game to any fans of the elder scrolls series or anyone whos new to the series. my favorite part about skyrim is the exploration aspect--although its world is not as bright as those of morrowind or cyrodiil, it has its many charms that make it such a great game. i recommend that you buy the game with all dlcs and get the official high res texture pack. and one more thing: get mods. even though the vanilla game has lots of content that will keep you occupied for many, many hours, you may get bored at some point. i highly recommend mods that add dlc-sized content like falskaar and wyrmstooth and those that improve the look of skyrim, especially enb, smim, ruins clutter improved, etc.",181.5
"if you do not get this game you are not worth all the food and oxygen keeping you alive",719.1
"though my current status says i bairly played, my ps3 would say other wise, 80 hours and more in game time, i must say the detail has issues but, all things are not perfect, it is very good in form, how the snow creats a cover form, how the tees in the distince sway in the wind, and the wild life are going about their days, although when shadows are in play the view is a bit disturbed, the shadows are more like pixled versions of the real thing, and when it goes on hills at points it just looks weirder, but still. very great detail. the voice acting is great and action is pretty awsome, having npcs react as they do in many grand battles along your side (the only issue is they are repetitive at times), but it is not all heads cutted off and bloody steel, the throat of the world, bards leap and the hall of storys where you learn your first shout has a great sight of skyrim, grand caves with falls of crystal like water, snow covered hills and lovely savanas, theres a bit of everything here in skyrim, the sights are great and the action never stops, the only issue with so much action is, what do i do with all this money?!",25.0
"i highly recommend this game as its hours of fun, high quality and amzing gameplay.",15.3

"i wasted my money... none of the issues with the last elder scrolls game have really been improved. within 30 minutes of playing this game after the introduction, i didnt want to play any more. with games out there like kingdoms of amalur and assassins creed, how can you have a game thats so clunky and where the combat is so terrible? thats the number one thing in my book. i have no idea how the metascore or any score for this game is so high. i thoroughly enjoyed kingdoms of amalur...played it twice through. its a way better game. it only took 30 minutes to not want to play this game any more. well see if i feel up to trying again later, but id rather go enjoy something else for now.",2.6
"no matter how many times i break this game with mods, something compels me to fix it and play. its one of those games with near infinite replay value. just wish bethesda would release games that didnt need to be patched by the community...",1213.6

"skyrim is an excellent game. its beautiful, and it really sells the illusion that you can do anything. i love the skill development system, where you do stuff, and then that skill gets better. i love the perk system, where you can boost some skills artificially. i really like bow hunting & smithing & alchemy, and running around collecting things to smith and to turn into potions. i only wish that your character didnt come with this built in destiny, because i always feel like i should be doing something more important than chasing butterflies or wandering down into caves.",152.5

"this is by far the best game ive ever played. just when you think youre done, you get pulled back in. mabye i should play a mage, or a warrior, or a thief. the lore is so expansive you just get lost in it, even now im just barely grasping the big picture of it. youre adventure as the dovahkiin (or not) will go on forever. the mods are so much fun, they add upon everything, from quests to cities to followers and armors there is a mod for it. 20/10 would ruin my life again.",435.4

"this game is a masterpiece. with so many ways to play like warrior, mage ,assassin necromancer and plenty more. this is a downright flawless game with so much to do. this is by far my favorite game of 2011 and 2012 and one of the best open world rpgs made to date and goty for 2011. 10/10",137.9

"this is one of my favorite games and i would recommend it to anyone!",108.4
"theres not much to say about skyrim since everyone knows about it and what it is. its the best at being an rpg that makes you want to meticulously get everything just perfect for your character, its nuts. even after all this time ive played it, i still havent beaten the main story line because ive been too busy clearing out caves and doing really fun side quests. every gamer should play skyrim at least once in their life.",145.0
"elder scrolls is not the best game beacause after a while youll probably notice it is sucking up a lot of your time. this is just my opinion so dont say  about this review and the game itself is pretty annoying and bad beacause there are so many glitches in the game for some people its annoying but other people think its funny but i dont so if you dont want a game that sucks up your time dont buy it i hate this game even with mods its not fun but other people think not but if your still playing this look around your room and yourself and think about it",491.6

"this is possibly one of my most favorite games all time. compared to its predecessar oblivion, the game has improved combat and graphics. i have put over 300 hours into the game on my console and recently bought on the pc. i can tell you bethesda has once again brought us another spectacular game worth playing. but these are just the good things about the game, but there are also some bad things. there is some pop-in from time to time as well as the water texture in the creek in whiterun sometimes bugs. but other than that the game is flawless. i recommend this one to all whom read this",58.9

"i have never cried at a game before, felt so betrayed by certain characters, i have never been so frustrated with a horrible interface. this game is one of the best games i have ever played in my life. i recommend this 100%, but not for people who have anger issues because the mouse regularly makes me want to smash my laptop through a window. i dont get why they dont just fix it because it really is a glaring issue. it has messed up quests for me, and i have accidentally murdered characters just because of the mouse issue. get it fixed, and this game is a solid 9/10 and i was never into games like runescape. the sims has always been more of my game, but this definitely won me over. 7/10 because of the mouse issue. and the characters should have more depth than they do, and they need to work on the dialogue because a lot of it is incredibly generic. now time to get back to esbern.",106.1

"okay on its own, great with mods. on its own it has a good story, although gameplay can get very boring at high levels. the expansions seem to be made as endgame content, they are much more difficult from the standard game, but still just as well-made. the workshop (and nexus mods) are what really make this game great, if you can imagine it, its probably a mod for this game.",122.3

"ive been a fan of the elder scrolls series since morrowind and even completed oblivion too. so far skyrim has a bit of everything from the previous games. skyrim still has its downsides, but the modding community is solving each problem one mod at a time. even after being released for more than 2 years ago, skyrim has one of the largest modding support ive ever seen. i recommend playing skyrim by itself, and if thats not enough try modding it until youre satisfied. as for me, im never satisfied since there is always something being added.",659.9
"the biggest and best open-world game ive played so far, and ive tried many. the number of missions, places, characters and stories is limitless. the game can devour you, and it will. beautiful graphics, a+ character customization, lots of fun. the only flip side is the length and monotonity of the dungeon missions. have you tried to finish off san andreas to 100%? that was a cakewalk compared to skyrim.",97.8

"truly one of the greatest games that ever was or will be, skyrim is something that has to be experienced rather than discussed to get why this game rocks. the fact that this game is still being updated with mods and that players are literally spending thousands of hours on this game speaks for itself. that being said, the game has its flaws (the dragons become just so repetitive, for one) but this is more than made up by its gargantuan scale, allowing players to do almost anything. skyrim offers an escape that few other games can provide and it only makes me hungry for the next elder scrolls installment.",123.6

"an absolutely astonishing masterpiece of a game that, even when the action dies down, amazes with breathtking scenery. the first time i took a late night stroll and the aurora borealis appeared it was obvious just how much love had gone in to the making of this game. far too many hours have been lost in this fantastic world and not one dungeon, forest clearing or mountain top has felt the same as another. the melee combat system is still not perfect but still feels satisfying, and when mixed with the excellent archery and magic makes you feel rather awesome. but the biggest enjoyment in this game comes from exploration. the quick travel feature goes largely unused as you will want to make sure you take in everything the world has to offer. there are literaly countless unique caverns to find each with their own genuinely interesting back stories and characters. absolutely not a game to be missed!",225.8

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is critically acclaimed, and for good reason; its a very solid open-world rpg, but is notably simpler and more casual than its predecessor, oblivion (which in turn was more casual than morrowind). however, while skyrim is a good game on its own, installing mods is a must, and with a collection as large as the steam workshop, the game can be modified to look as good as next-gen (as long as your computer can handle it), and the mechanics can be vastly improved or even overhauled. tl;dr: skyrim is good, but skyrim with mods is amazing. play this game if you enjoy fantasy rpgs with large and detailed worlds.",245.3

"a definite recommendation for this game! large space for free roaming no obligations to any quest a huge number of add-ons atmosphere (can be moded with add-ons) huge number of quests freedom to be whatever you want your character to be (assasin, hunter, warrior, tank mage, fat ninja, healer thief,...) crafting (modable by add-ons)... on top of that - it has dragons in it! y u no play this epic experience!?",172.2

"despite the annoying and occasionally hilarious glitches, skyrim is a terrific, immersive rpg worth your time and money. the world of skyrim is vast and immersive, and the game encourages you to wander and explore the countryside at your leisure/peril. there are seemingly hundreds of quests to take and dozens of tombs and castles to raid and plunder to your hearts content.",160.8
"one of the best games ever made, skyrim is certainly within my top five of favourite games. the amount of content is staggering and not seen in many other games today, you can easily reach well over 300+ hours if you truly immerse yourself. skyrim is gorgeous and the art direction is fantastic, every play session for me yields a few screen shots and the attention to detail is fantastic. the story is good and can truly feel epic if you take the time to immerse yourself in the game world. completing the side quest and various faction quests is highly recommended, these quests really add to the overall experience. if you can get past the bugs and put the effort to immerse yourself into skyrim, the game satisfy you for hundred of hours.",439.0

"i will start by saying that skyrim is a good game. with over 300 hours logged on vanilla skyrim on the console i can say it was thoroughly enjoyable. however what really makes skyrim absolutely amazing is the modding. you havent truly played skyrim until youve played an obscenely modded version of it that is tailored to how you want to play. the modding, although sometimes a hassle, makes the game ten times better. it becomes your playground; a world where the cold can actually kill you. it becomes a place where you can have a legion of followers. it becomes a land where the light source is actually the torch on the wall and not the middle of the room. skyrim is a land where dreams come true. its a gateway to the future of gaming.",351.3

"nice graphics, open world, good fighting system, much to do. but the story isnt made for elder scrolls noobs like me and the story wasnt really compelling. also i found this game to be pretty short when it comes to the main quests. ive only played 5 or 6 of them and im near to the end now but my character is by far not complete in my eyes. i dont find the side quests pleasing enough so this game seems to stay unfinished - because its overwhelming (and therefore boring). also with smithing, alchemy and enchanting you can create much to powerfull weapons, armor and potions... you can kill a dragon with one arrow if you like to. so you can overcome the pretty hard enemys in the beginning in no time. when i think about it maybe i spoiled my fun with leveling and stufff. im a bit undecided. =) in every point of view: 8 of 10 stars.",380.4

"its difficult to ever feel completely satisfied with a play session of skyrim. theres always one more pressing quest, one more unexplored tract of land, one more skill to increase, one more butterfly to catch. its a mesmerizing game that draws you into an finely crafted fictional space packed with content that consistently surprises. the changes made since oblivion are many, and result in a more focused and sensible style of play, where the effects of every decision are easily seen. featuring the same kind of thrilling freedom of choice the elder scrolls series is known for along with beautiful visuals and a stirring soundtrack, playing skyrim is a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced. 9.9/10 i guess.",121.3

"this game is too much fun, i love this game. 11/10",22.1
"i love it, it gave me 2 years of fun, i played every playstyle, every race, every way, every dlc. i been from a straight up heavy armor warrior with a huge battleaxe that can turn into a werewolf, and could stand still taking every hit from a dragon without losing almost any health. to a master thief who isnt very strong but can sneak through a entire bandit camp without being seen once.. all the way to guy who never killed a soul, worked hard for his money chopping wood. managing to build his own house and have a family. the main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore, you wont be bored for a long time. so dont just rush the main story and assume you seen it all. out of the dlcs, the best would be dragonborn. it offers a large new world, enemies, quests, armors and weapons. while the dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form, and hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes. the worst thing about it, is there will be bugs, which can easily be fixed by console commands. but only use if needed, like after 5 retrys a quest wont finish or continue. 8/10 only because it can get far too easy, and the bugs. you get stronger than all the enemies too quickly. so i say when you learn the game better, go on master or legendary difficulty for a challenge.",729.1
"i was like *slash slash slash* and the guy was like *ahhhhh* and i was like *hahaha* and then..then...then i won the game. :d",183.9
"an amazing game! the scenery is nice and the quests are fun. so many races to choose from and you can customize your character in any way you want. there is the main quest line and then all of the side quests. this is my favourite free roam game, it does it so well! you could play for hundreds of hours and still not have completed all of the quests. also, if you get the dlc that adds even more quests! the only problem is that there is the occasional glitch, some can be minor, and some major. but overall, this is an amazing game that you should buy! 9.5/10",17.5
"excellent game, keeps me occupied for hours. highly recommend.",71.2
"i explored the whole map and dont really want to touch it anymore, but it was fun.",94.8
"nearly 200 hours in, i will recommend skyrim. this is, to date and probably for a long time, the best game i have ever played. its as simple as that. theres just nothing in the world with comparable content, narrative, and customizable play style at the same time. this isnt a masterpiece, it is the masterpiece, and it is only getting better with mods and the promise of future expansion packs and other updates. just be prepared to give up $60 and more time than youre probably ready to give up on a video game.",498.8

"a seriously over-rated game. the visuals are stunning yeah, but they navigation and camera controls are clunky and horrible. the quest system is not bad but ultimately not as smooth as other solid rpgs. skyrim is too much a look what we can do game. its about the visuals and the tech than good storytelling or gameplay.",2.6

"great rpg, go where you want, kill who you want, steal what you want. the quest are great with a good story behind it (i dont do alot of story lines, not really a fan in any game). the combat seems like an improvement from previous elder scroll games. magic is fun to play around with but ill always use my trusty bow, the aim is right on, just hard to hit them flying dragons. skills are done nicely, if your an archer type, using bows alot, and wanna try 2 hand weapons, you dont have to make a new character, just start using 2 hand weapons with your archer and youll gain skill. since there is level ramping (enemies in the world level and scale up compared to what level you are) when you switch to using 2 hand weapons, you will notice a damage differance, but just keep using youll get your skill where it needs to be soon enough. its easy to get lost in doing side quest from the main story, as they randomly generate. over all, if you like alot of the elder scrolls and/or fallout series, youll love this. 9/10",341.4

(because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",68.4
"i love this game. its simple beauty lies in the amount of control the player has over how they play. skyrim is a different game for each person, whether you like to play as a mage, a warrior, or a thief. with seemingly never-ending quests and objectives, youll never grow bored of this game, because even if you cant find anything more to do, creating a new character creates an entirely new game and a new series of adventures. trust me when i say its really hard to get tired of this game. to top it off, the graphics are amazing, and bethesdas new engine is gentle even to some underpowered systems. i cant recommend this game enough.",163.3
"i love it 10/10 would install again because all my mods went corrupt xd love all the nude mods to.",141.9
"one of the best games that i have ever played. i know that the combat is not great but i dont really love skyrim for its combat, it is a solid exploration game with so much to do. the story and gameplay are a bit linear but its awesome fun all the way. the two content dlcs do add a ton of stuff to do in this game. music is simply brilliant. definitely a must buy.",192.3
"hundreds and hundreds of hours can be put in that game and it will still be amazingly fun to play, well worth the bucks!",809.4
"skyrim is a considerable step up from oblivion in every regard. even though it was made for the same generation of consoles as its predecessor, its a significant step up in terms of graphics. jeremy soules musical scoring is much more memorable, with a bunch of gruff viking chanting that sets the tone for your numerous dragon encounters. the setting, while not as original as that of morrowind, is much more engaging than oblivions bland vanilla fantasy outing. skyrim feels like a real world, vast and filled with secrets. the personalities of the various characters youll meet are largely forgettable, but there are a few that stick out. the dlc is somewhat disappointing, both in terms of how short they are and that some of the additions to gameplay feel cosmetic at best. still, more skyrim isnt a bad thing, and its far too easy to sink 80-100 hours into the magnificent world of nords.",183.3
"hmm, lets see, so far, its been amazing. so far you ask? because i still havent completed it, because theres so much to do in game! campaign or side! scripted or not! if you get bored of it, you are a weird person. a must have for your library, no doubt. edit: want a better pc to experience it better with enb and high res-textures. my real journey will start then >:)",24.5

"as a game, skyrim had a lot of potential to be amazing. while i do not think it that is was developed far enough to meet what was expected, it delivered a well rounded experience for those who were able to ignore its faults. the true garnish of this game however, is the modding community which is as heathy as its predecessor.",429.9
"this is the best rpg there is. its a huge open world game full of many dangers and surprises. this is a rpg that you do not wanna miss. the dlcs only make the world of skyrim more fun and larger. yeah so there are some bugs in the game, but its so little that it wll not be much of a bother. youll have a great time with the endless battles and quests you will uncover. ive only play only alittle of the game, and im fairly impressed. you battle dragons and the undead. if you do buy the game i recommend that you also buy the dlcs. there is a stroyline, but skyrim is more of a do whatever you want sort of game. you can follow the main storyline or you can just explore the huge landscapes of skyrim. if you love rpg games this will be the best choice.",8.3

"10/10 would mod again one of the best experiences i have had during my many gaming experiences,  the game was so amazing on console i was forced to buy it again on pc, and thats saying somthing due to the fact that half the fun in this game is to see how much you can mod the  out of it until it crashes your poor little pc. do yourself a favor if you have not tried this game out go an buy it and hopefully have as much fun with it as i have.",256.5

"skyrim is love, skyrim is life. now, seriously: the elder scrolls v: skyrim is amazing. while they kept the tamrielic lore and climatic part of previous tes games, they removed the class system -and it isnt bad at all. you can build any character you could dream of. the skills and leveling system is clear and working well, the graphics -do i even have to tell you? -and the possibility to explore entire province of the empire without limits (and also, in the dlc, parts of apocrypha (dragonborn) and soul cairn (dawnguard)) makes the game perfect. it really is as good as previous games, if not better. if you start loving the elder scrolls universe, you can be sure it provides both great gameplay and lore to nerd about. the game is said to crash sometimes -it happens rarely and if you download mods that interact badly.",204.6
"freaking amazing!!! this game lets you do virtually whatever the hell you want and i love it for it! i have played a bit of morrowind and im not a huge fan bucause of the mass difficulty of it but i love skyrim! i want everybody reading this with enough money to buy this to go get it right now! take it from me, its worth a measly $30! its worth $100!",71.3

"simply put, one of the best games i have ever had the opportunity to play, the graphics are incredible, the story is rich in content and the dialog is realistic and not overly dramatic, allowing you to immerse yourself in your adventures within skyrim and not realize that 14 hours have gone by sense you started playing. i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games that provide more then just shiny graphics, but also a rich story and vast hours of content that can be replayed in litterally dozens of different ways. -daggaroth",124.7

"came out almost three years ago, still a game i play all the time and would consider one of my favorites of all time. easily the best rpg game ive ever played, the level of customization that you can build into your character is amazing and the huge open world gives hundreds of hours of enjoyment. ive been a fan of the oblivion, and this game is by far my favorite to play, especially now that im playing on the pc instead of on the consoles. highly recommended for any players that want an amazing game in which to lose themselves for a few months or years.",137.8

"a true epic story unfolds as you strive to survive the harsh climate and perilous land of skyrim, trying at the same time to hone your abilities to an extreme and face an ancient and evil foe of the world: alduin... this game is a remarkable jewel for your computer game library; one of those few exceptions that no matter how many hours you play, you always go back for more. this can only outline the profound immersion you feel when you start playing from the very first minutes. in this wondrous world you get to fight myriads of undead, wild animals, thugs of all tamriel races, or even take sides and participate in a full scale war. the only downside i have felt with this game are some bugs that appear now and then, mostly having to do with distorted laws of physics, but i must admit that a lot of work has been invented by both the official dev team and modders all over the world alike to fix most of them. and in case *kidding* you can just imagine that in a magical fantasy world, maybe it is fine for a dragon to occasionally fly backwards! the game gets polished and enriched continuously and one can really tell by the multitude of accompanying mods freely available on steam. skyrim remains a solid investement for many hours of fun on end, even after 2 full years from its official publish date (11/11/11) !",528.5

"how could anyone not love skyrim? with mods abound to customize your game, its a game that keeps on giving long after you get into it. i absolutely love this game, and if i wasnt running on a very weak computer id probably never stop playing it and modding it. i suggest skyrim to anyone who has never played it, or even playing it on pc vs console (the modding capabilities to change the way your game looks and plays are so much better than console -- take it from someone who first played skyrim on her xbox.) absolutely well worth the money and an excellent game that you cannot put down.",459.2
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"this game is just fantastic. the storyline lacks a little excitement, but the amount of side quests is enough to take your mind off of it. many mechanics of this game are pretty good and the graphics are decent. skyrim is a great game for the role playing gamer and suits the needs of an action/adventure.",184.6

"i honestly do not understand why people like this game so much. the only reason i can think of is that is it a great time killer. you can walk around for hours, days, weeks even in this game and still you will have a quest log that is literally overflowing with things to do. now the problem for me, however, is that even after the 100+ hours i put into it, i still have not had any fun with any of these quests. they are almost all fetch quest for which you have to enter a dungeon, kill stuff, and go back to collect you reward. now this would be fine if the rewards are actually valuable and if the world and dungeons were interesting to explore. but they are not. the world, while big, is extremely repetitive. everything more or less looks the same. snowy mountains, plains and a few forrests. all dungeons look the same and there is very little enemy variety. and i found the graphics to be very bland and outdated. there are older games then this that look much, much better. the combat in this game is very clunky and lackluster. there is no challenge whatsoever, even if you crank up the difficulty. the story is boring, the characters are boring, and they stripped away almost everything rpg to make it more casual and accessible to the masses. in short: this is a bland, repetitive, unexciting hiking simulator in which you can kill some stuff every once in a while.",102.5

"skyrim is a great rpg game, with active battles, hundreds of different pieces of gear, hours of gameplay in the main story, and dont even mention all the sidequests. thres 10+ skills to level, in the 3 basic classes: the mage, the warrior, and the theif. the mage includes perks such as reducing the mana for spells, the warrior using less stamina for things such as power attacks, and the theif being able to backstab people for 15x the base damage. theres even in-game trainers if youre too lazy to level up a skill by using it.",44.6

"this game takes place in the world of skyrim, you are the dragonborn with the ability to devour a dragons soul.ive spent 230 hours on this game and i enjoyed every second of it, this is one of the best games ever made. - dennis",247.7
"its the best damn game ever. ive got over 350 hours put into it and i still cant have enough, partly because of the dlcs and partly because of all the mods the community contributes with. and even so, playing the game completly vanilla is still massive fun. you can start off a character with any race youd like, customizing your features and right at the start you can chose wether to run with ralof or hadvar (not that it has a major impact on the game later on), but you constantly have the option of doing it right or left and if you dont get the option then there is always the option of not finishing a quest and just carrying on with your day. theres not even a need to finish the main quest line, if you dont like dragons (although i dont get why you wouldnt) you can literally just ignore the quest until you want to get started on it. i just really f-ing love this game. no regrets whatsoever.",415.4
"one of the most fun fantasy action/adventure rpgs out there with an open world. there are probably thousands of quests to do, many sights to see, and the epic battles you will have are endless. the leveling system is incredibly unique and allows one to play exactly the type of fictional character they desire by completely ruling out having to choose a class. without a doubt, this is personally my all-time favorite game.",157.8
"skyrim is, in my opinion, the best elder scrolls game so far and it comes with a smorgasbord of mods which can further enhance the gameplay. skyrim is a musthave for any pc gamer :d",129.7
"even though i only just bought this game, i have put atleast more than 1.5k hours into my skyrim for xbox. and thats only vanilla, with the almost endless amount of mods and the capabilities for this game its defiently a game worth buying. i look forward to the experience with mods myself and i will gladly recommend this game to anyone.",40.2
"skyrim is a all round fantastic game it is asteticaly pleasing and with the story but when you get to the modding side of it, it just crashes i do enjoy but with the modding it should tell you what the mod is compatilble and not compatible with .",149.5
"im sure not much has to be said about this game. it is the fantasy rpg for any and all whether it be long-time fans of the elder scrolls franchise or first-time players. compelling storyline, hours of content, great dlc, user-friendly interface, and steam achievements. what else could you want in a game?",480.1

"this game is great for those who love fantasy/rpg games as it creates a great level of immersion, gameplay, and provides an amazing storyline. skyrim has almost endless possibilities and with 3 dlcs this game easily breaks 200 hours and whenever you feel like youre bored you can fight a dragon, to exploring an ancient dungeon with challenging boss fights. if you feel like to add on to the fun give the workshop a try and you can have all you need with armor and weapon mods. however the game does have a few bugs where your followers dont come to any indoor areas but can be fixed with just using the wait mechanic and wait an hour. but the only headache one is that in the civil war questline the quest wont start but sadly the only way to fix it is to start a new game :( . 9/10 have fun with the game of a lifetime",79.9

"well.... for me it all begin with morrowind with what i forge tes friendship... later oblivion, well little bit of disappointment but still great game and now... skyrim somhow it feels lot more close to morrowind, maybe things who come back as dwemer ruins, imperial outfits who much more seems as ones of morrowind or folk faces, i dont really know, but it feels in that way. as i love morrowind for its deep game play, with mage would be hard to play as warrior and backwards, leveled world and other stuff... there are things what i still missing in skyrim but in other hand it have piilars on its own- 1 great graphic what will make often just gaze on landscape 2 different character level-up system with perks and no class what allows you to mix and make avatar who are perfect for you 3 crafting.... yes now you can craft armor and arms 4 with dlc you can build house 5 make your family(marriage and adopt) 6 fast acton-based combat i could call some more but at the end if you somehow feel that game miss anything... well there are louds if mods and you can customise game in way its fit you",409.5

"wow, cant begin to descibe how good this game is.... when i first heard about people talking about this game i automatically assumed they were nerds, but playing this doesnt make you feel like you are playing dungeons and dragons, or wow. it feels like you are another person, choosing your own path; slaughtering innocent townspeople, becoming a hero who wants to protect all that is right, or even becoming a master vampire and living out in the marsh with a house you built (dlc required). the landscapes are stunning, the ai is, i cant say the best, but compared to games like just cause 2 and and arma 2, they are much better. i spent 250 hours playing vanilla, and still have not completed the dawnguard questline as a dawnguard member, or finished the companion questline (i hate the companions if you buy the game hopefully you will agree with me), and still am doing quests. need cash and love killing? join the dark brotherhood, a ancient organization which carries out assinations. want to be a master wizard (you get to zap people with lightning and )? join the mage college of winterhold. after 250 hours i got mods which made the game so much better. buy it. stop wasting your time trying to find out if its good, because it is.",362.9

"very dissapointing. there is little variety between quests, with most of them becoming, go to this burial site, fight generic skeletons, get to the end and take a shortcut that leads right back to the beginning. quest completions have little to no impact on gameplay either; you can easily become the master of every guild and no one cares. loot drops are very generic. cities are void of any real amount of people but it doesnt matter because theres only like 4 voice actors anyway. i hate to say it but skyrim has made slaying dragons boring.",92.9

"if your big in 2 rpg ,fantasy,dragons,storys that have adventure, makeing all diffrent kinds of wepons and amor, & yes did i say magic potions best of all this game is far from being short it has any where from 500 - 1000 hours of game play all depending on how deep you get into the game quest & side quest that sort of thing. i can go on and on and on there is just so much to do i give it a 5 out of 5 stars one of the best games i have ever played. and i played a lot of games i started out in the early 1980s on my 2600 atri.any how skyrim has it all. most of us gamers know about skyrim ! but there is always some 1 who hasnt. so check it out !!!!",344.1

"a wonderful game and a true testament to the elder scrolls series. not as big as my beloved daggerfall or arena, but complete immersion into the environment is still possible. an easy to use skill system (though i do miss the in-depth ones of old) and a great character generation system make the game easy to play your way. above all i love the customizability of the game itself, leaving it to the end-user to shape the game as they see fit. a great and immersive set of stories to go through, with dlc expanding it to many hours of enjoyable fun. this is by far one of the greatest games that i have ever played, and continue to play!",78.5
"this is my favourite game for a number of reasons. it has an unlimited supply of activities to keep the gamer occupied, including hundreds of quests, buy houses, build houses, explore catacombs, get married, adopt kids, hunt dragons and you have the ability to travel to other areas (if you have purchased dlc) and experience new worlds. i enjoy many aspects of the game and i have come to appreciate its fine details more and more time i spend playing it.overall its worth every penny and even after two years im still at it. i have completed the game and started over 4 times; each time with a character of a different race and different playing-style. each time, the gaming experience is so different and enjoyable. love it! 5/5!",185.4

"one of the best open-world fantasy adventure games in a long time, i absolutely love this game.",8.5
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4
"i purchased this game for $15, and in all respects, i have gotten my moneys worth. countless hours of exploration and adventuring. the main story is compelling enougy, but with the number of possible side quests, it becomes a game that can steal all your free time.",114.1

"incredible breadth but a serious lack of depth. skyrim is a land for exploring, but not so great for digging into. you really have to make your own fun once youve gotten the hang of the dead simple gameplay. dragons are more annoying than anything. can you tell how much time i spent playing oblivion? i wish this were just oblivion 2, cyrodil with a facelift and a massive amount of new deeper crafting systems and dungeons.",207.6
"what can you say about a game like skyrim, well first thing you can say is that its awesome, the second thing you can say is that while it does have plenty of bugs they arent game breaking for the most part, i completely support this game and reccomend people who have and have not played the previous titles to give it a go",91.6

"beautiful game! so many hours gameplay its unreal! the fun never ends....",70.9
"this game is awesome. you get to play as a slayer of dragons in the province of skyrim. dragons appear after centuries and there just happens to be a civilian war at the same time. good idea and, the opposite of most todays games, actually well executed. but the main advantage of this game (besides its lore) its that you can do anything. ever heard for a phrase skyrim can do that? well it exists for a reason. let me highlight some of the features skyrim has: -can use magic -can buy horses -can buy houses -can build houses -can become a vampire/werewolf -can catch fish -can have a garden -can kill dragons -can fight in a war -can shoot catapults -can become a thief -can become an assassin -can cook stuff -can have a library -can marry npc -can adopt children -can go into certain daedric realms (kinda like heavens and hell irl i suppose) -can shade the sun -can listen to guards but seriously the game is awesome and worth every euro/dollar/any currency. specially the legendary edition mods and console commands are a whole new thing and provide even more stuff to mess with.",127.2

"im late to the party here. very late. its... hard to get into for me. it took me several months to really get going, and even then i had to give myself a leg up with levels. i play for fun, not difficulty, and all that. it was honestly really dull until i found the mages college in winterhold. started doing that questline and i was honestly having fun. felt a little like a harry potter parody except were all grown ups. got some mods installed and did the companions questline, and now im doing general sidequests. i think main quest will be once every blue moon for me, but its actually somewhat fun now. might be because of a glitch causing me to run at a million mph though, i dunno. exploration is a nonissue due to that, and i can just nathan drake up/around mountains everywhere with it.",35.6
"besides of massive bugs and sometimes a very weird balancing - the most enjoyable rpg since some time.",278.6
"just bought and downloaded this game. i own it for the xbox 360 and wanted it to play when out and about. however when i click start a new game it just plays the starting music and i sit watching the dragon logo. this is a brand new computer so i doubt its anything to do with my specs which btw are very high",1.9
"best fantasy somewhat-sandbox rpg in existence these days. vanilla is a tad bland, but with mods from nexus and steam workshop, this game has given me close to 500 hours of solid enjoyment. no other game in my library has nearly half that time put into it. okay, i digress, oblivion might gain that much, if i can get past the darned vanilla npcs not making me want to retch. dawnguard: good dlc, plenty of story worth the price, wait till you can pick up on a sale though. dragonborn: own the dlc, never played morrowwind, and have not had the chance to sink my teeth into this content just yet. from what ive seen though it has been interesting enough. falksaar: head over to nexus and check this one out, cant really say much more about it here since its unoffical and all that.",778.0

"definitely worth the $7.49 i spent on it, though personally i just couldnt keep myself to playing it for more than a week or so. the games graphics look pretty nice even today, and the freedom to roam gives a sense of relief from other games. -if youre a huge fan of tes or similar games then just buy it because its good in the aspects it must be in, and you will have a blast especially with the infinite content the community gives you... and fighting dragons is a joy. -if youre used to other games be ready for seriously twitchy mechanics, primitive enemy ai, and some very gnarly examples of game physics. not that theyll irritate you (for the most part), youll probably get a good laugh out of alot of it and it can also save your life in battle.",246.7

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",248.6
"okay let me start off with this game by saying if you havent played it....play it. it is by far one of the best open world rpg games you can play during the modern era of gaming. if you want a rpg game that is full of things to do and places to explore than this a great game for you. the game is so full of places to explore, but there is always a catch. this game is nothing compared to oblivion on the quest. this game is a joke compared to the quest that you can do in oblivion. the quests in this game is basically just go into this cave and pick up the item and bring it back to the person. that is it. that is the game, but it is still fun. i cannot explain the joy this game brings visually and mechanically. the fact that the quest are a joke makes this game a joke though. the quest are short and simple. if you are a hardcore rpg gamer than buy oblivion or morrowind. you cannot beat the graphics and mechanics of skyrim. this game is worth a 60 dollar tag. if you find it on sale....pick it up.",140.0

"i recommend this game to any fan of the elder scrolls series. not only can you complete the game normal, but then create new characters and do different stuff. not only is it better than eso (imo) but it surpasses many of the other es games. if you like fast-paced killing slashing murder games. youd enjoy skyrim. p.s. if you get bored, you can always use mods and dlcs that add plenty of story.",39.2
"god what have i done. i killed a small armenian child with a shovel today. then when his parents tried come at me i gutted them with a spoon and now i have an ethiopian army chasing after me which is fine because in a few days they will starve in a few days anyways. whatever i can just play skyrim.",124.4

"i have had to purchase the game 4 times now because of various reasons. ive played through it multiple times and now that i have a good rig i repurchased with all the dlc to mod the hell out of it. its a brand new experience every time i play. 10/10 would recommend again.",21.4

"this truly is a masterpiece and incredible role playing game!",116.3
"thig game never ends, has huge replayability, and if you think you saw everything, thats where mods come in , a pro tip though: be very careful with mods i highily recommend you take only very well endorsed mods, and read everything about their compataility and the load order, if you want the game to roll with no problems.",223.3
"i hated this game the first time through. loved it the second time when i gave it a different mindset and threw away conventions of other rpg games. not bad. immersive zones and sounds really get you into it.",65.1
"i have always tried to buy this game but i wasnt sure about it, if you are into rpgs this is a must have, definitely the best game i have ever bought on steam, the world looks beautiful and really immersive, i do believe theres a lot of replayability you can spend hours and hours of good quality rpg gaming i highly recommend this game",30.5

"absolutely brilliant addictive, its taken over my life, reccomend to anyone who likes fallout 3 or oblivion",193.3
"the game is absolutely perfect. however, try not to use too much mods because they can cause ctd which is pain in the",89.8
"story is long and well written, graphics is amazing, sound is clear and beautiful. with you occasiounal bug here and there, but this game can be played for over a year without completing it dozens of side missions and personal mods and changes possible. a whole community that creates custom armors, houses, monsters and many more. add dragons to that and you have a real game for the players. a must play for every real gamer out there. 10/10",571.4

"if you dont ever play this game , you dont know what you lost :)",28.5
"such a great, and huge game. if you were a fan of the elder scrolls 4, otherwise known as oblivion, then stop reading this review and buy the game now. along with an insane amount of content, you can also add mods with the pc version which adds even more hours of gameplay. this is why even though i have the game on 360, i picked it up for pc as well. do yourself a favor and give this game a try!",16.5
"its getting a little long in the tooth these days, but its still a beautiful game. mods and graphics enhancements from the steam workshop only make it moreso. even 200 hours in, im still finding new places and people and quests. the replay value of this game is astounding. i cant recommend it enough. unless you want a life away from the computer, in which case you really shouldnt play this game at all.",209.6
"as an long-time elder scrolls fan, i cant deny that i love skyrim for what it is - an elder scrolls game. the lore, storylines and world is all there - ready to be explored with the various books and tales that characters tell. the argument that skyrim is a sea with the depth of a puddle is a valid arguement though, the world doesnt really feel as alive and deep as it could have been. while the gameplay is good - it isnt particularly anything amazing. the engine of the game, creation, is just a rehashed and reworked gamebyro engine from previous installments. as a result, it doesnt utilise the full capability of a pc. and while there are various issues with the game itself, these are all mainly fixed and improved by the community. this is thanks to bethsedas extended support for modding with the release of the creation kit and steam workshop (although i use the nexus sites and mod organizer myself). the vast number of mods that accomplish a sheer amount of things is nothing short of amazing. from bug fix compilations to whole new lands, you can pour hundreds of hours into skyrim when you add mods, breathing new life into the game.",256.7

"skyrim follows pace with all of the previous tes games. with such strong support from the community i doubt the game play will get old. skyrim is the type of game where you can find yourself getting lost and being completely ok with that.",64.7

"i dont knoww fully how to describe how  amazing this game is. pros: the graphics are amazing (if you have a good pc), the fighting is fun, the storyline is detailed and quite long so you wont get bored quickly, there are billions of side-quests for you to really get involved with, there is danger & adventure at every corner, overall an infinitely fun game! cons: you may never see the outside world again... but hey, if youre lonely, just make friends with a mudcrab!",182.8

"playing it through the 1st run through is great as it takes a while to finish off the campaign. the missions are diverse and intense, yet some show surreal serenity. the one problem which i have come across is repetitiveness, as when you make a new character you will find that you will drop off slowly. - squinty",8.4

"with dragonborn bringing back some great morrowing places, items and scenery this is now my favourite tes game.",118.4
"this game is definitely in my top 5 games that ive ever played. it can get a little repetitive once youve clocked up as many hours as i have (only the online 1s show) but i still enjoy it.",232.4
"its not like an oblivion or morrowind but its a the best rpg with open world.",44.2
"absolutely recommend! skyrim has some of the most unique and breathtaking vistas i have ever seen in an adventure game. the first person combat is hugely varied and the game world immersive and just stunning. one drawback is the ever-increasing number of bugs and glitches in the game but usually they do not detract largely from the gameplay.",540.4
"100% recommended for anybody looking for a purely amazing rpg game",805.2

"one of the best single player rpgs game out there with an immersive and addictive environment. and being true to a real rpgs game you are given one thing that is rare these days for rpgs: choices that mattered, and ability to influence the outcome of the games and shaping the worlds around you. you can be do pretty much whatever you like by being a jerk and kill everyone or play a lawful good guy or somewhere in between. in short, it let you do what rpg supposed to allow people to do: role play. and it got a storyline easy to follow and engaging. only complain is the inventory system can do better. it seem quite clear it was designed for consoles system in mind somehow.",112.1
"big world, lots of quests, lots of things to do. i enjoyed the magic system in this better then oblivion. only down side is the game was setup with more of a console ui interface. you cant switch it to something more pc friendly without third party add-ons.",601.2
"this game completely ruined my unexistent social life. had to rebuild it from scratch. 10/10 would lose friends again.",75.9
"amazing game!!! i get lost in it. it seems to never-end, full of quests and things to do. its beautiful too. a cool thing is the mods- if your into that. theres some awesome mods that make the scenery and certain game elements epic. definitely reccommend to everyone. seriously just goes on forever, aside from the main story. and even the smaller misc. quests are interesting.",321.9

"dis good very very good buy it!!!!!!!!!!! dummcuffs",146.9
"skyrim has everything you want in a game. good visuals, good story, good combat, and a great amount of variety. this game does a great job at immersing you into this world and keeping you there. it has dragons, werewolves, magic, vampires, otherworld gods, dark elves, mystery, robots, tragedy, humor, awesome loot, and epicness. what you experience is based on how far you want to venture into this world and on top of all that, you have the steam workshop to add even more.",173.7

"i was kinda late on the skyrim bandwagon, but i see now why it was such a popular game. this game has an extremely open world for exploration, such that the open world genre has been made an understatement. because of this, some may not like this game if that doesnt appeal to their tastes, but i was thoroughly impressed by the variety of content, and got personally immersed in playing it for hours on end without boredom.",150.9
"skyrim is a really good game. the story is good, the combat is good, and everything else is good. the only thing that would make it better is if you could have a friend join.",82.6
"trust me guys this game is not only the most time consuming game ever its also probably one of the most diverse games ive ever played with layers and layers of a amazing story to epic boss battles and even some bad  loot you dont want to miss out on this epic adventure. ya the combat could use some work but have you seen the modding community you can find anything to put in your skyrim to make the expereince even better so buy this game grab some chips a bottle of mountain dew sit back and relax.",16.6
"its amazing how such a saint creation was born. bethesda did respectful job, but as always the modding community takes it to a whole new level. and how? basically you never get short of new content, its like christmas every single day. ode to the mod makers! and my god, there is enb what makes three-years-old game to look it just came out yesterday . i actually feel sad for those misrable players who experience this work of art on consoles. well the rating..? be warned! this game might, just might f*ck your entire life around. 10+/10, game is a godlike b!tch.",569.1
"absolutely in love with this game, its all but perfect!",90.3
"dragons, vampires, werewolfs, magic, all put into 1 huge  world and what do you get? skyrim. an amazing game full of twists and turns allowing you to do just about everything in this game even get married and run around pretending to be god by shooting lightning out of your hands and yelling at people causing them to fly 20 feet if they piss you off except for giants and mammoths.......and dragons.......those are to big.........they just get pissed off at you and go lol nope but anyway a fun game really awesome if your a slow gamer like me and like to look at everything this game will take you a good 300 hours or so to beat but really worth the price its at right now because you get lost in this game really easily........",1154.8
"an epic rpg, with a good story. the choice to play as thieves and assassins is always a great character option that keeps that tired hero theme in check. i found the dragons got boring after a while, but the massive world to explore, and good story twists make this a great game.",523.2
"very good game. open world rpg love just exploring and the different quest lines for guilds. 10/10",90.3
"its my most played steam game, apparently, and obviously complex in its breadth and complexity. ill try to keep this simple. it gives me what i expected from it: ample exploration, adventure, and avenue for character aggrandizement; thorough customizability through character options as well as thousands of mods; and a deeply detailed world to engage. as an overall game, it strikes a different balance than its two predecessors. i look to enjoy the strong points of each ones balance, though those strong points and balances each be different. the mods really are a crucial thing, though. from bug-fixing and other quality of life to tweaking balance choices i would not have made to bringing in the idea that i will find yet more things to reenergize the experience, they remain an integral part of my tes experience. ill tell you one other thing: i personally have spent way, way, way less time struggling to just get the game to {keep working, stop crashing, stop obviously bugging out}, and i do appreciate that contrast to its siblings.",626.9

"i found skyrim to be immensely enjoyable. right from the word go you are able to make a character from multiple races and alter their appearance as you wish. after the tutorial you are released into the vast, beautiful world of skyrim. as you travel around the land you will experience breathtaking scenery, from snow-covered peaks to glowing caverns, and many unique caves/dungeons/ruins which contain a multitude of enemies from spiders to dragons. you can spend your time mastering the many skills available or completing quests, which there are a ridiculous amount available. in doing so you can gather equipment to allow you to create any kind of character imaginable. if you enjoy an rpg with freedom of creativity, dynamic combat and awesome scenery the skyrim is for you.",845.9

"like a few other people, i honestly thought elder scrolls were crap. the things id seen didnt look good, so i formed an opinion prior to playing the game. thankfully, im happy to report that after buying oblivion, the game prior to skyrim, i was proved so incredibly wrong. the games have so much to offer that theyre damn near perfect. the odd thing i wish would be different, but those things are minor, that the pros vastly outweigh any con i could come up with, and with the modding community, any con i could come up with is being solved, bringing it closer to the absolute perfect game. while my playtime isnt high on steam, i do also own skyrim for the 360... and ive logged probably a good 500 hours or so there playing through everything. and even though ive played through everything, it just doesnt get old. you can play and reply this game countless times, lose hours, days, weeks and months exploring this beautiful world. and if you have the expansions, it gives you even more places to explore. i cannot rate this game highly enough, and i would recommend it to absolutely anyone who loves rpg games. if you dont want to read all that above... simply put, this is a must have title for any fan of rpg games.",214.1
"i waited about a year for this to come out on console, and i have to say that im not dissapointed. i first bought the game on console wich there is no community workshop to download from. but even with no community created items the game is amazing, buityful, even better than i imagined. 9.8 out of 10",49.4

"this is an absolute fantastic game. the story and side quests never get boring, and if they do you can always add something from the workshop to make it a bit more fun. i lose track of time when playing because the game itself is just so mind blowing. this is an absolute must when you are bored and looking for a game to play. there seems to be endless possibilities on what ever adventure you wish to choose.",122.4

"this game is superb. a childs story book come to life, with wonderful multi-layered character drama. gameplay is challenging, but not unforgiving, and the freedom to pick your own skills lets you experiment hastle free with every type of interaction this rpg has to offer. your never locked into one style of play, or one storyline. entering many stories at once, makes it feel like youre character really lives a busy and involved life that matters. seeing many stories through to their ends, gives a sense of completion and satisfaction akin to finishing 8 other full length games. skyrim is where wonder, relaxation and excitement come together, in an almost impossible beautiful harmony. this is the current apex of interactive fantasy.",171.8
"score: 10/10 just, amazing! a must in any library! the ammount of content inside the game can easly make you run for hours! all dialogues are dubbed which is huge deal considering the ammount of content. the free dlc improved the graphics to a high standard and all the mods available in the community can increase replay time undefinitely, if one so does want to, and/or change the gameplay in so many different ways that i could not cover in this review. you can also dwel into your own mod and make your experience unique. the game provides you a pletora of quests, exploring and creature slaying for all tastes. i would recommend playing the game a while without mods because some of them can totally change the original feel of the game. if youre a veteran coming back to skyrim, you will find that they are a great addition for replay.",211.7

(lolz)",516.8
"apparently i just wasted $60 because i wasnt aware of the myriad mouse problems that bethesda hasnt bothered to fix in over three years. also found out that steam doesnt do refunds. youre welcome for my money bethesda. youll never get another dime from me. they never should have released this game in this broken state, especially with a lazy, money-grabbing developer that refuses to fix the real problems.",2.1
"im not one to review a game but this game really screams out at me how fantastic it is. i recommend this to those who enjoy open world free roam games. worth all of the money and theres not much else to say. so get it now",139.7
"this was my game of 2011 and 2012. i spent the better part of a year and a 1/2 playing it. it is that fun. the world is much larger and much easier to explore then the last eldar scrolls game (oblivion). much of the complexity in terms of skills / stats/ abilities has been trimed down for a tighter core experiance. i found it to be better this way, i dont see myself saying this game would be a lot better if there were seperate skills for long swords and medium swords). the greatest addtion core character wise is the addtion of perks, a system that rewards leveling with increased skill ability. you can choose which perk areas you want to upgrade, and by using a given skill set (let say swords) you level up that particular area. story is relativley generic, yet some how powerful. i do feel like i am the only one that can save this world. the quests are varied and you never know what you are going to get. i have played through this game at least 5 times and i still always find new things to do, dungeons to explore and quests to complete. i cannot do justice to this game other then saying you should buy it and you should pllay it.",118.7
"absolutely amazing.. stunning visuals. great modding community. hundreds of hours worth of content. great and deep story. great voice acting and npcs. need i continue?",139.6

"skyrim is an amazing game where you can be the dragonborn, cast shouts, do magic, and defeat the neverending waves of evil in the land of skyrim. you can do outstanding things like dying repeatedly, sitting in your desk chair for hours trying to farm your smithing skill, killing innocent people, and if you have mods, killing children, and fapping to naked women! what else could you want from an amazing rpg game where youre the ultimate badass *to an extent*? 10/10 it was ok",65.9
"you get to cut peoples heads off and be a werewolf have you boought it yet?",84.0
"a great game for anyone who enjoys deep rpgs, whether you played any elder scrolls previously or not. graphics are nice enough, but the universe is very expansive and immersive. the real beauty of it is in modding, like through the workshop. you can really tailor the game to what and how you want it, upping pretty much every aspect to a personal 10/10, with enough time into looking around.",161.8
"deep storyline, tons of quest and dungeons, stunnig graphics, infinite modding tools. in shoty a must have.",492.8
"apart from all the hype this game receives, it is not that interesting. the story is not captivating, the combat is bland, and there is far to much traveling. as a person who loves shooters, games that focus on sword play leave a lot to be desired.",3.0
"had this for my xbox but just the basic edition. bought the legendary, soooooooooo much prettier. awesome game",35.4
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim. skyrim is a beautiful game in its own and very repetable becuase you can always find new ways of playing through it maybe you wanna be a warrior that throws huge fireballs at your foes then you can do that. but in my opinion the best part is that you are able to use mods to make the game a better experience for you. i could talk about this game for days but i dont wanna spoil anything and learning how to play the game on your own is the most fun way of playing this game. if you have the chance to pick up the game you relly should! have a good day! :d",32.0
"this is the awesome game. very nice gameplay, very good story, i like to play on it.",1.6
"best game ever!! graphpics are great, and lots of quest to do.",188.5

"i cant help but come back to this game after the massive disappointment of elder scrolls online and wish they had worked using skyrim instead of oblivion as the foundation. such a vastly superior game, its sad i feel more of a connection with the ai in this game than the players in eso.",127.7

"one of my favorite all time games! deep interesting stories and charachters will keep you coming back!",153.1
"not the best rpg ever, but it will do. couldnt finish it coz of the inconsitance in character clothing, nothing made sense, everyones naked in -30 deg centigrade. dragons sucked, werent even real four legged dragons, more like wwyverns. most important thins was taht the combat sucked major balls, fortuneatly after dozens of mods it was berable",50.3
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",71.8

"look at my playtime.... just look at it! thats how much i love this game.",1121.0
"many, many, many hours of fun can be had here. the world of skyrim is vast and alive. a bit too vast if you ask me, at every turn you will be distracted from your main quest, and before you know it youre drowning in content and wont know where to go. awesome =d",71.0
"i have this game and i love it! but instead of me ultimately torrenting it again, and then using a cider wrapper to be able to play it, why not release a mac version? it would really help as it is a massive pain in the  to get all the files for it. 10/10  fab x",12.7
"when you have a game where you go to check the time and its six hours later, you know you made an excellent choice. bethesda delivered as expected. a truly advanced rpg that honestly lets you play a role howeer you want. whatever the price may be, its worth it. many games today can be six ot twelve hours (even less) and beluieve they justify the $60 release price. heres a game that gives and gives and gives. you can expect a minimum of 90 hours of gameplay; 200+ if you care to search every shadow of this cold yet breathtaking world. and then when you factor in the dlc along with the mod community, the amount of time you can invest is exponential. buy it. you wont regret it.",45.8

"one of the best games ever made, get it if you have a spare 15 quid.",234.6
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"skyrim can be summed up in one word. brilliant. the gameplay is brilliant, and the world is immersive. the combat is balanced (most of the time) and the world is rich with lore. there are, however, some bugs though, many of which can be avoided, but some of them can be quite a pain. bugs are more prominent when using a modded version, however. skyrims world is beautiful yet harsh, and it has masses of content. add on the ability to mod it to oblivion (no pun intended) and you have a great game. all together i give it a 9/10 because of the sheer beauty and immersion this game provides. it would be given a 10 if not for some relatively major bugs.",213.4

"surprisingly has little lag, and is simply beautiful. ill expect to have many hours put towards this game.",9.3

"its suprised me that wild open world. but attack motion is very suck how it like hit air.",267.2
"what can i say, its another elder scrolls game. even the vanilla game with no mods is fun. where this game excells is when you start adding mods. so many resources and places to get them that just adds tons and tons of content. i feel bad for anyone that bought this on any system other than pc. its a solid rpg, but like most es games, mods take it to the next level and make it worthy of hundreds of hours of gameplay.",149.4

"there is really no point in me writing a review of this game since its so old but i cant help myself. i got it for my psn when it first came out but i decided to get it on steam too because its just that wonderful. the story, the music, the landscapes. not to mention all the options you have. you will feel like you decide the story, not the game itself. this will always be a game close to my heart and i can guarantee you that this game is so worth the money and time. if you havent played this game please do yourself a favor and try it! 1000000/10",48.9

"this game is a open world game and has lots of great context thru out this game if you never played it i think you have a problum, if you never heard of it then i cant say what i think of you. but ok this game has a nice game, has a great story mode and if you want to venture out and do your own thing then you can do that, has great graphs and your may want to hold back on some graphs because its to high for some computers. now this game has some bugs like you may not be able to pick up some wepons sometimes but thats ok, also you might come across dead bodys moving across the floor, but those things wont mess with your game play. now this game comes with the steamworkshop, so if you want to get some cheats in like the ring of the gods, then you just go to the steamworkshop (after you buy the game) and then you just subscribe to it, and its in your game. but read the passage of the item you want in steamworkshop before playing the game because that is where it will tell you to find the wepon or item in skyrim. but yeah this game is great and if you want a serous game with dragons and great gameplay, this is your game! :)",111.1
"i bought this for full price no less than a month ago... great.",1.7
"this is a very good game where there is many diffrent kinds of gameplay because of how you start & of what happens to you throughout the game. many games are not like this one just because it is open world, you can choose what to do & when to do it, & the gameplay is always unique to each time you play. hopefully for whoever reads this review knows that buying, giving as a gift & playing this game are all good ideas that are worth it.",393.0

"i love this game everything is great the only thing missing is the lack of co op.",122.1
"well, what can i say? its oblivion, but without the bugs. the freedom of the elder-scrolls-games is legendary, and the main quest is captivating. even though i miss the beautiful autumn landscapes and forests and the golden dusks from oblivion, i love the cold snowy mountains of skyrim all the same. its incredible how i feel the cold air even in front of my computer, just because of little perks like the slight steam effect on the loading screens and the carefully and perfectly designed sfx. its a game where you dont even have to do any quests - you can just enjoy the solitude of a high mountain. again, jeremy soule does an amzing job with the soundtrack, especially the epic tracks for dragon fights, but also some of the peaceful tunes and, of course, the main theme.",256.4
"fantastic. if you cant enjoy this game, than your in the wrong ing genre. never fast travel and allow the immersion to set in and yep there goes your life.",40.3
"the thing i love most about this game, is the ability to form an entire story all on my own within the game, then when i get bored, go back to the original content. after you spend many hours indulging yourself in the vast world, and youve done pretty much everything you can, you go to the modding community and you have a thousand reasons to get back into the action for many, many more hours. the storyline is great, but after you beat it and restart a new character, it gets very repetitive, but there is so muh other stuff to do it really doesnt matter. you can either be the guy who runs in with a greatsword slicing everything up, an assassin who uses only a dagger and stealth, an archer with a wide variety of bows, or a mage who would rather set their target ablaze or freeze them solid, then bring them back to life a their thrall. you could also mix and match to get your desired character. all in all this game is one of the best games ive ever played and if you have not played it then i dont know whats wrong with you, but you better get into the action because you wont regret it. i only have had this game for two days on the pc but on the xbox 360 i have hundreds if not thousands of hours into this amazing game.",144.6
"skyrim is a great game that really gets you hooked in and makes you want to play the story more and more as you play it. skyrim is also open to steam workshop so mods are really easy to install and the game is really well optimized so i dont thimk anyone should get any lag what so ever",86.7
"this game is 50%, 25% talking, 10% loading screens, and 15% actual combat. i never got into the story and i dont like dragons",145.4
"a gaming experience that offers a variety of enjoyable playthroughs and a character development system (perks, guardian stones, etc.) that lets you play without as much of a hinderance on playstyle as many other games would seem to enforce, while keeping the door cracked open for interchangeable playstyles without being overly forced to make a new character to play as you want.",1057.9

"for the most part, skyrim somewhat better than oblivion.. and i loved oblivion. i dislike being limited to 1 ring (and not 1 per hand), which breaks 30 years of fantasy convention (and not in a good way). also, i dislike clicking on an option and having a different option chosen by the stupid menu / options list... still, the overall job of storywriting and graphics advancements help to make up for these issues.",190.2
"this is definitely one of the best games i have ever played i love it everyone that has the money should buy it and give it a try see if you like it.",65.0
"best role playing game of all times.. a huge variety of missions, armors, weapons & creatures etc. a never ending game with no chance of getting bored..",22.4
"my favorite pc game of all time (havent tried eso yet) but i wish i could choose either 32-bit or 64-bit, because i have a 64-bit laptop but i only have the 32-bit game, and i dont know how to change that.",37.3
"10/10 will leave lydia to fight a troll and run away again.",15.4
"i highly recommend this game. personally i belive this games age rating is over rated, as there isnt much gore, (well bar decapitation) and swearing is minimal. this game never truely ends, as i have completed all storyines and quests, but restarting and playing from scratch is still a gripping experiance. the modding community is amazing (sometimes xd) and brings a whole new leace of life to a game that strangely resembles game of thrones in a lot of ways...",564.3
"amazing game! right up until the very end, it was interesting. i was also able to mod the game easily, giving it a very realistic feel and look, as well as improving some gameplay kinks in the final release. great game!",209.6
"its the game that never ends, and stays fun after over 500 hours of play. >9000/10",600.2
"in short, this game is awesome. very good graphics, nice dialogues, too many quests to count, so much things to do. i must give a warning though...be prepared to sleep a lot less when you start playing this game.",159.3
"played 50 hours on one save. game glitched on battle of solitude. had to start over. 10/10",55.8
"this game has become one of my favorites simply becuase of the almost boundless roaming freely, the dlcs (i have all), the mods, the gameplay, and graphics. this game allows you to do just about anything you can think of. you can, murder, rob people, buy houses, travel, marry, adopt kids, and even go to college. it has great creatures roaming the lands, bandits, witches, demons, dragons, trolls, vampires, and werewoles. you can even become a vampire or a werewolf....unfortunately theres no hybrids between the two. fortunately, though there are guilds you can join with their own quest. throughout this game you will recieve many titles and do mysterious things....especially if your a vampire or a wolf. also to mention that you can unlock these amazing perks as you level up. those perks will benefit you very much with whatever weapons you choose/use. theres even a such thing as console commands......in other words cheats. all-in-all, this is an excellent game to have, play, and to own.",52.4
"do i recommend this game? hell yes. if you like to explore and kill , this is the game for you. this game has so many hours of gameplay into it. i have 160, and im only level 42. definately get it next time it goes on sale.",226.3
"ah, adventure. theres a reason this game got game of the year. it rightly deserves its place on that list and definitely deserves a place on your pc!",80.2
"the elder scrolls v: is a good reboot of the pacman franchise, please note the v: in the title, it isnt a :v because this is a gritty edgy hardcore reboot",8.5
"skyrim is an elder scrolls game so of course it is amazing. a brilliant immersive rpg. you can choose so many different ways to play it, like a stealthy thief character, a destructive magic wielding mage, an archer, or a brutal warrior. and because of this it has a massive replay value. there are so many quest lines available, that you probably wont finish them all in one play through. ive only got a few hours on pc, as i mainly play on xbox. the graphics on a half decent pc are a lot better than the xbox though.",36.7
"this game is awesome. i feel like im living out the best of david eddings books!!!",270.6

"much gud. very not suck. such reccomendation. bui tis gem.",56.2
"pros -graphics are great. -mods, mods everywhere. - massive open-world to explore. - be who you want to be. cons - main storyline was too short. - some minor bugs. overall i love this game to death, its something you can always come back to.",171.2
"amazing. so many hours of gameplay to join the amazing story and world. (not including all the mods you can install) just get it. give steam your monies. theyre waiting...",47.8
"this game is awsome!! i had never played any of the previous elder scrolls games so when this came out i didnt give it a second thought but a friend convinced me to play this at his place and i was addicted. it does a really good job of bringing you into the world and making you feel like you need to make a difference. it has one or two problems like repetitive speech from the npcs and ocasional graphical glitch but dont worry you will hardly notice. now i am looking forward to elder scrolls online, i hope it can be even better.",29.7
"what, youre thinking about buying this game and are looking for recommendations? what, are you some sort of ing casual!?",12.4
"surely one of the best games released in the last few years, skyrim let you play in the fantasy world of tamriel, in the province of skyrim. hundreds of hours of gameplay await you if you are a fan of achievements and if you like to complete all the quests and objectives a game has to offer. the main story line is nice and also the biggest sidequests. dungeon are cool, although they can become a bit repetitive after a while. a great game to play, especially now that it doesnt cost much and the chances that you have a computer fast enough to run it at full details are higher.",375.1
"whats better than being dragonborn and saving the world... oh wait, anime. <3",259.0
"i dont have to tell you that this game is awesome. you should already know that.",12.9
"one of the best rpg games in the last decade. i highly reccomend :)",137.0
"although it has a few bugs this game is amaizing! highly recommended!",185.4
"first game i played in the series, and it has so much to do, i think its worth buying this game!",58.4
"ahh, skyrim. this game was more than a game, it was honestly an experience. when i first played it back in 2011 when it was released, it blew my mind away with how amazing every second of gameplay was. i first played the elder scrolls in 2010 in oblivion, and that was one of the best decisions in gaming i had ever made. seriously, if you havent played skyrim, let alone the elder scrolls series, you owe it to yourself to play it. it is more than just a game..",111.8
"great game with lots of things to do. if you like open world and many choices of good or evil then this is your game. 8.7/10",74.6
"very fun and worth putting at least 20 hours into it.",163.7
"if you love adventure and like to make a character in your way of style and skills this game is for you this game has made my day when i first played it and it hasnt let me down since :)",1.3
"if this game doesnt make a girl squirt idk what will.",3.7
"this is a welcome installment to the elder scrolls series, the detail put into a goodly portion of this game make it even more awe inspiring thatn its two older brothers that also had a more visual theme (for those that dont know, the first two elder scrolls games were more or less text based, morrowing is the first time we got to take a proper look around the provinces of tamriel) it does have a few bugs, but with a game this big, you have to expect a few (frostbite spiders not withstanding) and the community and mods ive found so far, merely enhance everything for me as a whole, i highly recommend this game to those who love going out and exploring and adventuring, it will drain a lot of hours, but youll always find something new and fun to do",133.4
"lame ending. that said the game is full of win! played it for six months racking up 250 hours of game play and i feel like i barely scratched the surface.",249.5
"what can i say that hasnt already said? its an amazing game and with steam workshop and nexus its much better on the pc than on any console!",262.4
"nearly 70 hours in and i feel like i havent even started the game yet. so much to do, so little time.",69.8
"the 3 reasons to play skyrim : 1) be anything you want. the skill and perk system really lets you build any archetype of character you want as you play. you can be a classic all magic wizard or all melee fighter or all sneak cutpurse, but you can mix and match to make an armored warlock who summons his weapons or a sneaky two-weapon fighting ranger who heals himself with magic and poisons his arrows with alchemy. 2) the world looks gorgous. even if the game came out on in 2011 on last gennerations consoles, it still looks amazing. on pc, with the official hires patch, the enb series and select texture and lighting mods, the graphics can be cranked to eleven. 3) youll play for hours. skyrim, by itself, has content to keep you busy for months. i accumulated over 50 hours of playtime before visiting the last of the games five main cities. once you add the two addons, dawnguard and dragonborn, and once you add content mods like interesting npcs, you are set for hundred hours of gameplay.",582.3
"this is one of the best games i played so far and if you like viking time and dragons this is a game for you, you can even blow people back for meter with the fus ro dah. buy it people it is a really good game",381.0
"ive played the elder scrolls since morrowwind and this one is the best one yet! i am a khajit that is the leader of the dark brotherhood, a member of the circle in the companions, the arch-mage of the college of winterhold, part of the thieves guild, of course the dragonborn, and many other things. gameplay and graphics are amazing, and this game tells you how to play and then cuts you loose, you can do whatever the hell you want, no ones gonna tell you not to. kill dragons, pickpocket, murder, jump off a mountain, shout the jarl so he glitches into his chair (i do that alot :d), and whatever else! 10/10 would be a murdurer and a pickpocket again!",253.9
"i love this game... there is so much to do in skyrim the only annoying part of this game is the beginning and by annoying i mean: o my god id rather kill myself. from picking up flowers ingame to modding the crap out of it, everything is fun, i got almost 200 hours in it and there are many more hours to come! definitely a must buy if you like games that arent over in a couple of hours. the story of this game is meh but everything else is superb. 9.5/10",231.5
"the best role-play game ever! great voice acting,awesome story line. like myths and dragons? then play it! ;)",106.2
"hands down the best rpg ever. a quality single player game that will keep you absorbed for a very long time. get the legendary edition that includes all dlc and add further improvements with tonnes of modding options available.",248.6
"since picking this game up for ps3 at launch after waiting four hours in line, skyrim has enthralled me endlessly and provided endless possiblities for living another life in another beatuifully fleshed out world. buying the game for pc only widened the options with modding and added an infinite possiblilites and things that may have been missing. skyrim, like all other elder scrolls games, is a must have for any fantasty action rpg fan and their collection is not complete without it.",339.7
"amazing graphics,gorgeus open world game of the year to me",27.2
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",71.8
"at the start of the game i ended getting stripped by a bunch of  bandits then an imperial guard gave me some pants and i fled. by the time i reached a nearby town, i tried cross-breeding a dragon with a rabbit. the rabbit kept leaping out of the dragons  so i just effed the rabbit up doggy style. i saw a man sleeping in his comfy bed, but i had the urge to break into his butt. guards caught me and i was brought into this court full of as bandits. they said told me that thy were gonna allow this violation as long as i were to  inside. that sums my skyrim life story up 10/10 game of the century!!!!",7.0
"this is the best game ive ever played, by far. its so deep and theres so much you can do. 130 hours in, i ran out of big questlines to do and now ive been clearing all the dungeons i skipped over earlier in the game and redoing some old ones. with mods, the game can look like it was released last week, not over 3 years ago. also i hate the thalmor.",168.7
"i just cant stop playing it, this is a super awesome fascinating masterpiece in game history,every rpg fan should try it, im sure you wont be disappointed with it!",196.8
"this is a wonderful game! too bad i bought it for 15 dollars the day before the quake sale sold the legendary edition for a buck cheaper. -_- that made me pissed...",17.2
"its a great game to jump into for both long time elder scrolls fans, and new players alike! a tad easy though...",87.9

"the real rpg of 2011 you will addict it for sure!!!! fus ro dah!!!",82.7
"was most certainly not worth the exorbitant amount they were charging when released, but now at $5 its worth picking up to  around in at least. i got a few mods that made it more enjoyable and overall had fun.",65.9
"its simply the best open-world role playing game ive ever played, and its 2011s game of the year. you need to spend hours and hours to fully explore skyrim. this game is beautiful, amazing, and brilliant. i have nothing to say more. just get the game, it worths it! 10/10",45.7
"this is my pick for game of the year. gameplay is much improved over oblivion and a number of changes have been made, but most of them seem much more in line with the themes and atmosphere of the setting. if you are interested, you owe it to yourself to pick up this game.",365.9

"almost 200hrs spent in this game. do i need to say anything more?",242.9
"definitely the best rpg of all time. dont argue with me",171.9
"one of my favorite games of all time. whether you have played past elder scrolls games or not skyrim has hundreds of hours of exploring, questing, and storyline. if youre looking for multiplayer, this is not your game, but it is a great single player game.",334.4
"the ultimate open world role playing game. never have i immersed myself in a world such as in skyrim. you play a... thing, one of several races, and you have to do... something. but you get to wear armour abnd upgrade it, and do magic and sneak and shout at things and get to fight dragons!! yes, there is a story in there somewhere, but saving tamriel from the return of the immortal alduin by means of time manipulation somehow dissapeared to the background as you spent your time pickpocketing, mining and installing mods. ah yes, the mods. this was the biggest factor that garunteed replayability (or at least extended the original playtime). because the code was made available for modders, gamers and programmers could craft their own addons and make it available for other players. now you could have your character run around looking like mario if you want. while there is a central storyline, youll probably try at least to finish at least one the faction storylines, the thrief and assassin guilds probably being the most enjoyable. but then there are hundreds of side missions that will keep you away from your loved ones for months and have them doubt whether you were even there to begin with.",944.7
"the game is much less engaging than i expected. it feels like a corridor shooter with a sword.",0.8
"for some reason when i was trying to play this game when i startn it and it gets on the loading screen it atomatically closes the game it worked before but now its not working?????????????",20.0
"th e folks at bethesda really outdid themselves with this one. although i miss some of the more creative aspects of the previous game. all in all i love the skyrim world.",104.8

"the game is fantastic! there really isnt much to say if you even know bethesda softworks and the elder scrolls franchise is.",64.0
"great game though the command codes can make or break the game for you though. be sure to go to the workshop there is a lot of great additions to the game to improve the overall experience of this game. this is a classic and i can see my self playing this game for a very long time.",47.8
"ive re-played the story over 3 times, and had a completely different experience each go. 10/10.",63.0
"this game is great but really hard to play unless you have an extremely fast computer.",42.8
"this is the best game i have ever played, ever, ever. the amount of depth, and detail to everything is just incredible. one minute youre picking flowers to work on your alchemy, and wam a dragon (sometimes two) just come out of nowhere, and things just get cray.",46.4
"this game is amazing. ive been playing it since it came out.",38.0
"i do recommend this game becasue it has great lore and it has lots of quests and once you complete all the quest you can get mods for the game then do them quests if you quests mods or you can start all over again its fun every time i have restated to gain diffrent skills and diffrent ways of doing thing like i have made a theft and a mage a battle made and a warrior and a paladin and other classes and you can do other stuff to with the help of mods of course",224.5

"i played this game on the xbox and plan to continue. i have roughly 600+ hours of gameplay on skyrim on xbox. the good of skyrim is its diversity and freedom. you can do almost anything and everything you want your decisions and you make the best choices. free roam options are plenty and the world is big enough for months of gameplay. tons of modifications you can add to the game from either the steam workshop or nexus. 10/10 i recommend to anyone who is a big fan of rpg games",1.9
"one of the best games. only real weakness is multiplayer.",54.2
"let me give you a little insight into my life in this game. i have boughten this game 4 different times for 3 different systems. (pc, xbox, ps3). i have spent hundreds of hours on it between all 3 systems since its release. but yes, get this game. if you are a adventure/action genre lover. youll marry this game.",116.9
"this game will suck away your day, but it is all worth it in terms of happiness. bethesda has perfected the art of creating beautiful, bug-filled masterpieces. theres a dead dragon body (not the bones, the limp body, mind you), that fast travels with me and drops itself all over silly places. whats not to love?",128.9
"great game with awesome mods i rate it ten out of ten its worth the money but its a heavy game not best for old and light computers.",91.7
"one, if not the best game i have ever played. there always seems to be something to do in this game. starting a new game is not a problem either, since theres so many diffrent ways to play this game, it almost seems like a whole new game. the addition of mods is also a big plus to the pc version. there is just something about this game that keeps pulling me back. at this time i have over 500+ hours of gameplay and i dont regret any secound of it. 10/10",538.2
"great game, do as you like with in it and amazing graphics espically with shaders and mods",1.1
"i have played tes:4 oblivion and at that playthrough i was amazed about the details that game had. next rpg game that i played is dragon age: origins that bored me from rpg genre. many years later i found my rpg game that has long play time, cool and a lots of features. not the mention skyrim has infinite potential at modding which adds more play time to game. so far this is best rpg game ever made in 2010s. i can guarantee that just exploring skyrim with dlcs needs at least 80 hours of gameplay.",51.5
"very fun game, but at times it will close on me randoomly after a while of gameplay which really annoys me especially since its random. missions are linear, just go in, kill this, get some gold, youre done. combat is fun though, story line is interesting, and the mods are great.",371.1
"really good game, and tons of easy to install mods in the workshop.",97.0
"skyrim... what can i say? its a masterpiece sandbox rpg with tons of replayability. a massive step up graphically and sound wise from oblivion. skyrim, like the mountain tops so prevalent within the game, stands above many other rpg titles.",216.9

"i first purchased this game on ps3 when it first came out, but after i got an alienware i decided to take the plunge and get it for pc. boy was that the best decision ever. this game is beautiful. the graphics absolutely blow me away with the detail, and the ability to make me feel like i am walking in the world of skyrim. the gameplay is great too. i prefer to play with a controller, and it is extremely easy and inuitive to get that set up and working. all controls are easy to use. as for the gameplay itself, i could play this game endlessly and always find somethign new. i have started over i think a total of 10 times and havent gotten bored yet. (i just like to try different characters out) wonderful wonderful game and i can safely say one of the best i have ever played.",228.1
"i think its one of the best games i have ever played. the graphics are amazing, the npcs feel like they have life and not a robot, the battles are awesome. to me this games should definitely be a goty. i totally recommend it. p.s. much better then oblivion!!!!!!!!!!!!0",371.8
"best game ever ! this was my first elder scroll game and from the very beginning i love it ! the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is great, but the best part of skyrim is the inmersion ! you can do whatever you want, be the main story or the sidequest, you will always have something to do. you can spend all day and not get bored in this game. the dlc are nice additions, although you already have enough content with the main game by itself. and if by any chance you get bored, theres always the mods community making news stuff ! when i cracked this game i liked this game so much that i bought it because its a masterpiece. its that good. seriously, stop reading this and go buy it and play it :) !",60.6
"with a vast variety of side quests, missions, random encounters, class types, and more, skyrim is a game that has one of the highest replay values i have ever seen. played an assassin? try dual daggers, dual swords, dual axes, dual maces, any combination of the weapons. try without illusion magic or making yourself invisible. try without sneaking. and there is so much more just for that one class type that makes the playthrough different. with an immersive overarching story, there are still stories within the world that unfold as you progress. read notes left lying on a table to learn more about the people who live there, or discover theyre not who they appear to be. theres so much to do, and no playthrough is exactly the same as the next, which makes this game an epic achievement. i would not only recommend this game, but encourage people to get it, as it is certainly fun and fulfilling.",132.9
"i really enjoyed the game, hunting dragons and exploring for hours on end.",1273.0

"skyrim, the fifth province in tamriel, and home to the nords of the north, proud and arrogant, have waged war against the empire. when you begin, you are but a prisoner, as usual, but thanks to a set of circumstances (dragon) you are set free to explore this vast and lush land to your leisure, as well as do as you please (though a few activities may land you a bounty) as an open-world game, you gain infinite possibilities, from fighting dragons and mammoth, to crawling around in draugr infested crypts, you fight all manner of enemy, large and small, and get to create your own legend, as you master the thuum and defeat alduin (spoiler alert) personally i havent tried this game with mods, but i will attempt to get some soon. vanilla, this game is easily one of the best i have ever played, would definitely pick this up if you can.",175.5
"skyrim is the 5th installment of the elder scrolls series. its graphics are stunning and gameplay is equally so. with the steam workshop mods, this game gives you hours of entertainment.",33.7
"this is a game so diverse and so widespread that i started to sweat while playing it. im not quite certain why this is rated m since their is no nudity, they dont really swear and theres barely any blood. the graphics are outstanding, story line is kick- and ah... what am i wasting my time here for? i should be playing this game right now!",36.7

"ive had this on ps3 for ages but its so much nicer on pc.. almost no load time better graphic. and such a time sink... great game!",111.2
"bethesda continues to thrive with this kind of game. ive been hooked on their gameplay since fallout 3 and skyrim is by far their best work thusfar. you cant ask for a bigger landscape to explore, and characters/weapons are just as detailed as the world around them. quests are very fun to do, and the storyline (if you sit through all the talking) is very well executed. the dlc is also a must, it adds so many fun features that you dont get with the regular game, so i do recommend getting goty edition.",66.8
"i would recommend this game if you like adventure, fantasy, dragons and all sorts of other epic things. this game is awesome!!! best rpg i have played so far.",143.0
"the only game that you killed a farm chicken then a whole castle of guards get you, best game ever~",103.6
"take a look at my play time. that should give you an indicator of how i feel about this game. then, factor in that i havent even completed the main quest yet... the base game is pretty awesome, but the community mods here on steam workshop and on nexus are what really make this game amazing!",480.2

"would have been the perfect game if not for lydia giving me sass about carrying stuff. im the dragonborn, god dammit, just be quiet and carry the remains of this gigantic dragon i just bare-knuckle punched to death.",24.5
"so far pretty fun. i just wish it had a action bar like rift and wow does so i could get some extra use out of my razor naga mouse. kinda dumb that im a caster and have to use both hands to cast when i was watching the new lord of the rings last night and he had a sword and staff and could still cast. still a pretty fun game once you get the  weight removed from items you carry. stupidest idea ever specially for a kleptomaniac like myself. i have like 200,000 gold and i still steal everything in sight cause i just cant help myself. if its lootable its mine",39.5
"this game has sucked in more hours of my life than i care to mention. (mostly on the xbox though) its well worth the time and money. great game.",34.7

"this game is amazing. there are few games i can play over and over... i can with this one because im not trapped in a linear story, i can do what ever i want. though they did mess up with the vampire expansion, get a mod if you get it, to prevent merchents from permadeathing from random, constant vampire attacks.",361.9

"with mods the game is an enjoyable and lush camping simulator, with interesting characters and stunning visuals. by default however the game is worse than its predeccesors in almost every aspect, with the exception of graphics(which still look blurry and wooden). the (fetch)quests that make up the game are reptitive and boring romps through the same linear draugr infested holes, a far cry from the mazelike and diverse dungeons of morrowind. the citys despite being the largest in their respective regions are tiny, with the largest only being made up of 13 buildings, as opposed to daggerfalls massive metropoliss, some having over 200 enterable buildings. the quality is debatable, but for the average user glitches and bugs will be prominent with people falling through floors and farm animals reporting your crimes to the local guards. however if you decide to install a variety of mods to fix these shortcomings, you may have an enjoyable adventure ahead of you.",97.4

"fairly decent game, especially with mods. has a large open world, however most of the content is the same from dungeon to dungeon. mods are pretty much a must in my opinion, as they do a number of things, from increasing the difficulty of higher levels, making it look much better, to fixing a number of broken or exploitable mechanics. i would recommend skyui at the very least to make the ui much more usable for someone in with a mouse.",231.0

"its difficult to ever feel completely satisfied with a play session of skyrim. theres always one more pressing quest, one more unexplored tract of land, one more skill to increase, one more butterfly to catch. its a mesmerizing game that draws you into an finely crafted fictional space packed with content that consistently surprises. the changes made since oblivion are many, and result in a more focused and sensible style of play, where the effects of every decision are easily seen. featuring the same kind of thrilling freedom of choice the elder scrolls series is known for along with beautiful visuals and a stirring soundtrack, playing skyrim is a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced. i have to say i give this game a solid 10/10.",135.7
"amazing game. heaps of classes to choose from and various paths you can choose. whether it be an archer, a cold hearted assassin, or a brave and courageous warrior. skyrim is the game for anyone wanting a true rpg with realistic graaphics and fun gameplay. the main quest is great. while it is short, there are many side quests to do. it takes over 120 hours to finish the entire game. that is truly enormus! the game is open-world, and you have a sense over danger and exctitment rushing through you when you are exploring caves, looting dungeons, and more! skyrim is a fantastic game that anyone can play 9.5/10",1.5

"after 200 hours on pc and 350 on console, i can definitely say this is one of the most expansive and fun rpg games in a long time. the level of options regarding combat are quite limitless; whether you want to be a man-sized cat sneak-thief, a heavily armored medieval warrior, a powerful mage, or an unarmed monk that simply uses ancient dragon shouts to level his foes. the graphics for its time were stellar enough, but with the vast mod community and official support by the developer bethesda, there is a myriad of mods to enhance every visual aspect as well as in-game mechanics like player animations, tweaked crafting and leveling, different mounts, improved ui... the list goes on forever. whether you choose to use steams built-in workshop or the third-party skyrim nexus site is at your discretion. the game contains a main quest, faction quests, side quests, and miscellaneous chores, as well as a preposterous amount of dungeons to be cleared and looted. however, this is only vanilla version; modders have constructed several well-built custom quests of their own. in one case, a team of modders made an entire game expansion, similar to an official paid dlc. buy this game.",200.2
"skyrim is by far one of my most treasured and favourite games released out there! its vast/open world gvies you an over-abundance of freedom to do what you please! skyrim provides a great element of choice as you have the freedom to be who you want to be, and some of your choies may influence alternate paths to a story once foretold. you can choose to be the hero, or the villain. you have been bestoed a gift from the gods, in the dragons tounge dovakhiin you have the power of your voice, and by destiny the dragonborn is the only mortal who can slay and rid the world from the awakining of the dragons. as quoted - the empire of tamriel is on the edge. the high king of skyrim has been murdered. alliances form as claims to the throne are made. in the midst of this conflict, a far more dangerous, ancient evil is awakened. dragons, long lost to the passages of the elder scrolls, have returned to tamriel. the future of skyrim, even the empire itself, hangs in the balance as they wait for the prophesized dragonborn to come; a hero born with the power of the voice, and the only one who can stand amongst the dragons - written by bethesda game studios tracgods meta score - 95/100",84.4

"subtract everuthing you hate about past elder scrolls games, add evrything you love, add a better engine that does not crash on you every 10 minutes and is not a steaming pile of bugs, pretty up everything, make the faces cooler and make just about everything better and you have skyrim. this game is a masterpiece, its the game that we have been waiting for in 2011, (most titles this year have been bad to say the least) this gmae would deserve a perfect 10 if not for the super lame secondary main quest which is the civil war, you can kill the final boss in one hit, i understand that level scaling is bad in most cases, but in some cases things have to be level scaled. the annoying part is, the civil war is about the length of the dragon questline! this game would get a 9.7 in my book now, thanks to that one little detail, but since metacr---steam forces me to round up my score, 10 it is! also, if you really want to complain about the crappy interface of how you painfully select everything and how its built for a controller, do one of the following things : get a mod, or use a controller, we all have usb ports! 12/10 its alright",33.3

"this may or may not be an amazing game. i cant tell. the port from console to pc is so bad that its basically unplayable. the menus are unreadable, the controls are bizarre, the field of view is restrictive, and the amount of head-bobbing induces motion sickness. automatic kill moves take game control away from the player without the players input, often resulting in death. like most console games, one keystroke has many functions, and the game does not even give the option to rebind them, which should be the first requirement for a pc port. dozens of mods and two years later, and i still havent found a way to fix the core issues that are built into the game at its most basic level, the point of user interface. for someone who is used to pc controls, pc monitors and pc games, skyrim is unplayable and unredeemable even with mods.",6.7
"would love this game a whole awful lot more if my computer could run it correctly. then again, thats what i get for using a nvidia graphic card with mods installed. i played this game extensively on xbox 360, and had a lot of fun. its just that, i wish this game could have multiplayer options, not massive multiplayer, but maybe up to four people. still, if you want to waste 800 hours of your life, this is your next best option.",0.8

"it is very buggy and nearly unplayable without mods. but it is a good game. get it and get mods that makes it work and you are golden. you will not regrett it. get skyui first of all because the standard ui is more of a punch and vomit rather then an actual ui. you might suffer the occasional crash and such. that is rather the norm these days anyway. bethsda might not do much to fix errors in their games but at least they let users try to. not perfect but at least its something.",323.3
"i used to love skyrim, but then i started to play oblivion again. i realised that oblivion was much superior, just because of some little features. one being hand-to-hand combat. in skyrim it takes an extremely long time to take down someone/something with fists. in oblivion i took down just about anything with four punches. not only is hand-to-hand what skyrim lacks in, but it doesnt have much tention. in oblivion the gates of oblivion mattered. no one else could shut them down, but you. skyrim uses dragons to replace this and says youre the dragonborn only you can defeat the dragons, but when fighting dragons the town guards can easily kill them with a flimsy bow and arrow. i know that skyrim added a lot of great features, like marriage and dual wielding, but it took away some of the great features of the elder scrolls series. bribing people to like you was so great in oblivion, but now in skyrim i have to grind away at quests to gain peoples trust, which turns me into a keyboard warrior. i love skyrim, but if i had to pick an elder scrolls to play i would easily pick oblvion, better quests and better cities. i have to rate skyrim a 7/10. it can be addictive, but soon becomes dull if you discover the world of the elder scrolls iv oblivion.",488.6
"epic fantasy with a good plot. stunningly beautiful scenery and detailed villages and people. countless side quests. this is skyrim. id say its one of the best games ive played in years. those dragons are really tough, though. its not one of those games where you kill all the ememies without dying once. overall, its well worth getting.",149.8

"skyrim is an immense game, at the beginning u might die frequently because the lack of levels, but that will change later on. sooooo much to do in the game, from mining valuable materials, to marrying an npc. dragons r also in the game and they are quite a challenge to kill (depending on level). if u have the chance to get this game, do not, and i repeat, do not pass it up.",363.7

"dragons, shouting (people off mountains) with your thuum, what more could you want? it does have graphical enhancements over its predecessors: tes iv: oblivion, fo3 & f:nv. far from the blinding luminescence of oblivion, the lighting has been tweaked to give a more realistic, gritty look. the landscape isnt (& doesnt feel) as auto-generated as the cyrodilic countryside in oblivion. it does still retain some repetitive audio bites from npcs, but no worse than oblivion or morrowind. although, at least they dont all sound the same this time around (as they did in oblivion). menus are a sore point for the game (with key shortcuts they can be bypassed though), although the ingenuity in designs do deserve some praise. with plenty of room and things to expand, bethesda should have no shortage of dlc and expansion ideas. overall: i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys an immersive fantasy rpg steeped in lore and history.",384.1

"definetly one of my favorite games of all time! if you like the elder scrolls franchise, or just like adventure, buy this game now!sure its glitchy, but if you overlook that, it is so fun! its an open world with a seemingly endless amount fo side quests. i recomend this game to anyone and everyone. you can play this game for years and not do everything. i have owned this game for a couple years, (on xbox and pc) and have only scratched the surface of what you can do inthis game.theres the mages college for mages. theres the dark brotherhood for assasins theres the theives guild for theives. sorry if this is turning into a gush fest, but if you are considering playing this game, do it! buy it. you wont be disapointed",36.1
"if you love rpgs and medieval themes, you will love this game. skyrim looks and feels genuine and alive. the world is enormous in lore and sheer size and it will always offer dynamic new quests and events that will keep you busy for ages. apart from the graphics, the sound and dialogue are top notch. this is story telling at its finest. the game is endless, you can keep exploring and reinventing yourself. you do not only have the ability to pick a race and gender, you can also make the character exactly the way you want. there are an insane amount of properties you can set so you have thousands of ways to alter how your character looks. after you have created your character, you can turn him into anything you want. if you want a warrior with dual swords, axes or a bow you can. are you more into mages, then go right ahead. you may also make a hybrid, the possibilities are near endless. do yourself a favour and get the legendary edition!",182.6

"very awesome game! i love it! great story line, and gameplay, very reccomended!",11.7
"i have put in over 400 hours into this game on the 360. the mods available for the pc could very well make this the better version. when it comes to games that you have complete and utter freedom to do whatever you like, this is the game. no doubt the average player will plug in at least 100 hours of game play before they get bored (which getting bored just sounds impossible to me).",2.9

"ok i think everyone knows what i have to say about this game... i love almost all the bethesda games, so there is no surprise that i love this game. skyrim is just another one of bethesdas master pieces in my opinion, this is a true open world experience with so many choices, i do kinda like this game a little better then some on the fallout games because of open world, in skyrim you can keep walking and find a ton of stuff (caves, quests, towns, etc), where in fallout there is not too much to find. so i would give skyrim a 10/10 just because of how amazingly awsome it is. also steam workshop yaaaaaaay!",67.5
"great open world game. the steam workshop mods really help to personalize the game to your liking. i would reccomend to this to any person starting in rpgs.",36.5

"skyrim is an amazing, jaw-dropping immersive rpg. with stunning visuals and open-ended game play there is very little not to like. i have personal gripes with the variety and depth of the quests in comparison with its predecessor oblivion (in particular with the dark brotherhood quest line), but other than that this is an immensely immersive game that can be many types of fun all depending on how you play it and how many times you play it. lots of dungeons, ruins, and caves to explore as well as dragons to fight. i dont think skyrim is a game that ever quite ends - there is just so much to do, quest and explore - and if you ever really get bored you can always mod the game and that adds a whole new twist to it!",180.6

"this game without a doubt is going down in history as one of the best games. i played an excess of maybe 2-3 thousand hours on my old ps3. only recently did i get the pc version, and all i can say is that the mods, the modding community, and the sheer measure of how much you can add onto this game with them? makes the game a thousand times better, and it makes me sad that i cant install every single one and play with them forever. this game is surely worth getting, if you can only buy the base and none of the dlc? worry not! mods can add in entire story lines with new armors, weapons, dialogue, locations and many many more! all in all, i wil always love this game, and always recommend it to anyone. no matter how old this old but favorite game gets.",30.2
"there is so many things i could say about this game this game is beautiful and amazing and perfect and just badass magic and dragons and free roam and do whatever and so much more this game is amazing and people should buy it i love it and its amazing the view of the stars at night and moon and much more i give this game 10/10 ing amazing better on pc than 360 anyway so buy this game its truly amazing",61.5

"well this game is pretty nice. its sand box game. i can do whatever i want in the open world. its like real version of minecraft i guess? anyway this is truely recommended. why? its really nice game and you can either kill chicken which was owned by other people in the village after that you will need to go to jail. but that is not the only reason that i am recommending this game. its story made me cry which was epic. most of the games didnt make me cry but skylim, it made me cry by accomplish the acheivement or killing the dragon. so i recommend those who want to play in open world, or kill chicken and go in to the jail (in game) but i dont recommend this to whom doesnt want to see blood or violent things. it sometimes make you say ewww. point:89.2/100.0",4.8

"interesting game. i cant say much for the depth of character building (as oblivion had a lot more options) but i can say that many perks feel more relevant. leveling is simplier now. a bit disappointed with the voice acting, but with a game this huge its not surprising to see a corner cut somewhere. overall a very worth-while game. expect to get your moneys worth here- a lot to do and it seems the quests never end!",200.4

"this game is the true meaning of the word epic. it is a beautiflu adventure, has great gameplay, and enough content to last 5 years (when the next game comes out hopefully) the only thing i can find wrong with it is that you cant kill the children without a mod. but mods are easy to install with the workshop so it does not even matter. buy this now.",165.7
"right off the bat, if you love the elder scrolls then youll love this installment. for all others, if you love western rpgs centered in a medieval-esque world then youll likely love skyrim. offering a wide ranging set of options in an open sandbox, you can play almost any sort of character you want. hell, chances are, if there is a major flaw in your gaming experience with skyrim then a mod can fix that, and if not then mods will make it better. and, as should be common knowledge, the elder scrolls fan community in turn supports a massive modding community that seeks to make this series even better. pick it up.",238.9

"a very expansive game, skyrims vast map is, if not the best, one of the best virtual world ever created. the map is full of things to do, prey to be hunted, ingredients to be collected, enemies to kill. not to mention the random creature spawn that makes the world of skyrim feels alive, not just scripted by the development team. when you turn that corner, there maybe some random npc giving you quest, some guy walking along the road that can train you in your way to become a speechcraft master, or an old orc warrior who seeks an honorable way to die. so much things to do, so much variety, which makes pouring hours upon hours on this amazing world feels exciting every single time. the main quest is epic, but compared to the many side quests in the world feels kinda dull. the freedom to build your own character is so liberating, particularly because of many strong arguments from many types of play. add to that many amazing mods which has already been created, makes this a truly living game which always evolve with new content. truly a great experience.",67.7
"totally recommend, great atmosphere, advanced character buildings and also moddable! some gliches, thats all.",122.6
"skyrim is an amazing game released by bethesda 3 years ago. it is the 5th game in the elder scrolls series. i have only played skyrim (tes 5) and oblivion (tes 4). skyrim is a game with a lot a re-playability, so unless you have no patience, then youll enjoy it. allthough it can get very repetative sometimes. one of my friends describes it as going into dungeons and killing draugr. the main focus is around the dragons, which have returned after the oblivion crisis. i highly recommend this as it is now quite cheap and so are the dlc which let you ride dragons, become a vampire lord and build houses among many other things. cant wait for the next elder scrolls game. (not online, thats daylight robbery)",1223.8

"i originally got this game for the x-box, but i have since turned my life around and converted to pc gaming. as a result, i got this game, tesv, for my computer. i love every single pixel ever rendered into a form on this game. more specifically, i love the quests, the characters and the scenery. although i cant run it on the highest quality, it is one of the best damn games i have ever seen. the complexity and open-world feature is what truely make this a game to remember throughout the decades to come. although it isnt the first of its kind, it definitely is one-of-a-kind and should be played until there is nothing left to do. the game is also highly personalized, allowing you to choose whatever path you want. if you want to be a theif, or an assassin, or a mage, then you can do so. every person can go at their own speed, doing whatever they want. you can battle dragons, and kill things with your voice. just remember: dont hit the chickens. praise talos. do i recomend this game? with any chance. 1000/1000",48.8
"wonderful addition to the franchise. mods by the community make it an unforgettable game.",649.4

"if you like open world games of any kind and you think slaying dragons and being a total badass is fun, then this is the game for you, if your system can handle it. the only bad things are fetch quests, minor bugs (that can be really funny), and sometimes annoying characters.",215.4

(because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",69.3

"this has to be my favourite game of all time! id never played rpgs before this, so i didnt really know what to expect. all i knew is it was big, and that attracted me to it. i played this through to 100% on vanilla settings and i thought the graphics and scenery were awesome. then i discovered the modding community. the amount of available mods is mind blowing, to the point you can create a world so beautiful youll never want to leave. 630+ hours on multiple play throughs and modding and i dont regret a minute of it. buy this game. 11/10",632.4

"an 8/10 for me. the graphics of this game is astounding. breathtaking scenery and a powerful immersion effect towards players. recommended to use a high res display with surround sound to maximize experience. very open gameplay allows you to do whatever you wish and your progress as in how far youve gone in the game can be clearly marked by subtle yet intriguing details. love the various races you can play as and the spell effects though staves are rendered quite useless. covers various aspects of medieval classes from the mage to the thief to the warrior and anything in between. mod-ability greatly improves graphics and gameplay. great storylines and lores. however, prolonged gameplay does induce fatigue as some quests are similar in most parts. other than that the leveling system is somehow broken as in you need to delve into all class types to reach higher levels and the legendary skill perk is not exactly legendary if you know what i mean. however, all in all a great game that you absolutely cannot finish exploring in a week. plus: love the choice between first person and third person views :)",378.8

"this game is a open world game and has lots of great context thru out this game if you never played it i think you have a problum, if you never heard of it then i cant say what i think of you. but ok this game has a nice game, has a great story mode and if you want to venture out and do your own thing then you can do that, has great graphs and your may want to hold back on some graphs because its to high for some computers. now this game has some bugs like you may not be able to pick up some wepons sometimes but thats ok, also you might come across dead bodys moving across the floor, but those things wont mess with your game play. now this game comes with the steamworkshop, so if you want to get some cheats in like the ring of the gods, then you just go to the steamworkshop (after you buy the game) and then you just subscribe to it, and its in your game. but read the passage of the item you want in steamworkshop before playing the game because that is where it will tell you to find the wepon or item in skyrim. but yeah this game is great and if you want a serous game with dragons and great gameplay, this is your game! :)",111.1

"super fun! you guys have to get it, the only thing that bothers me is that i should have waited to buy it when it went on sale! still a fun game andtotally worth the $20, plus you can mod it which adds so much more once youve completed the game!",66.6
"wow. this is the first game that i can never get tired of, even years after the release. it is plain as day, one of the best games of all time to me, because of its sheer potential with modding and the overall game itself. everyone should have this game.",287.8

"i previously played skyrim since its launch on xbox 360. i put hundreds of hours into just the vanilla game itself. i decided during the steam summer sale to get the legendary edition on pc to be able to play skyrims huuuuuuge dlc. i have only finished one of the dlc and a couple other missions and already put 24 hours into this game. not only does it come with endless hours of gameplay, the gameplay is exciting and even better with the mods made by the community. i bought skyrim for pc just to be able to play the dlc, but i ended up getting so much more. mods carry out the lifespan of the game even longer and immerses you even deeper into the the lore of tamriel.(depending on the mods you choose.) this is definitely the best game to buy if you are looking for a cheaper game with a massive amount of play time and replayability.",49.7

"played this game on my 360 and a lil less than 400hrs. i did everything and i still wanted to play it but just couldnt. so now that im away and cant rightly use an xbox, i now have it for pc. i am having even more fun now. i loved skyrim the second i first started playing. oblivion was awesome but skyrim took my brain and smashed it through the back of my skull.",56.4
"bought it because of the summer sale and all the good comments everyone would make about this game. so far, im really excited and glad about this purchase. the game is somewhat serious, but really fun, and even under low graphics config it looks good. i recommend it for the rpg lovers.",12.2
"if you like spending days and days and days sitting at your computer absolutly addicted then this is the game for you! the depth of this game is unparalleled to pretty much all other games, you can play for days and only discover one thousandth of the map, same goes for the graphics and everything else. although it may have a few bugs, it should be expected with such a massive game. all in all, everyone should atleast try this game even if you know you wont like it, you might find it to be an amazing game!",163.5

"this is a great game for all those people who like to chose a what to do rather than having to do one quest line. awesome game!",248.2
"tes started out with arena in the 90s and for its time it was top notch graphicswise as well as contendwise. bethesda managed to hold up this high level throughout the entire tes series till this ,skyrim. skyrim is more grim storywise than any previous tes games. its looks insanly awesome imo and with the musical sound youll get thrown into an adventure unlike no other. skyrim easily tops its predecessors...even morrowind (i thought no rpg could top that one ) the whole atmosphere of the game is geared towards majestic entertainment.if that isnt enough continue reading..... ...next big thing is the creation kit ... modding never had been this easy for tes...and with a visit on tesnexus you can get mods that are gonna change the whole game into an entire different experience, the dlcs are all good ...maybe as an pc user you wont need heartfire dlc cuz you can do better with mods or even urself if you spend time on it. skyrim is definatly something you dont wanna miss if youre into rpgs, period.",672.1

"probably the best rpg ive ever played. 10/10 would reccomend to anyone.",29.1
"i swear, the money put into buying this game will always be worth it for almost any gamer. you can spend so much time just exploring the aspects of the world skyrim takes place in, the visuals are breathtaking, the game-play is phenomenal (although it has its fair share of bugs). if you get done with everything somehow, it has a large modding community that produce mods that, with the help of steam, are super easy to install. seriously, if you havent played this game and have at least $30 for a game, buy skyrim. you wont regret it.",969.1
"if you like killing things and watching giant lizards fly then you will wanna have kids with this game.",49.6
"one of the best games for any moderately new system. while very few tasks change anything about the world you are in, the voice acting and optional depth of lore is still immersive. the amount of quests and personalities can keep you occupied for a rediculous amount of time.",291.3
"im sorry for not caring enough to tell you for how long i played the game but im just too disappointed in every way that my only wish would be to get a refund right away. the story telling is just week from the start, the incentives for exploring are slim to none (worthless) and the world / engine seems in no way reflecting of what could have been possible in a game like this even in 2011. the high res texture package doesnt make it any better.",3.1
"the elder scrolls series by bethesda has always been very popular with its replayability value and its amazing gameplay. skyrim has taken it to the next level with its amazing graphics and never ending, never the same gameplay. i give this game a 9.8/10!",38.4

"seriously, what could i say about skyrim that hasnt already been said?? its an open-world rpg! its an ocean as deep as a kiddie pool, meaning there is tons of stuff to do, tons of content, but most of it isnt very deep. it doesnt really affect the world at large. but ya know what? its still super fun, and has hours of content, especially considering there are tons and tons of mods to customize basically every piece of it, as well as add all sorts of content. check it out.",27.0
"absolutely phenomenal game. wholeheartedly addicting. beware.",100.9
"i can not think of any reason not to get this game",32.7
"this is an amazing game, with a dedicated community. ive never played a game so non-linear before. i could soak thousands of hours into this game and probably still find new quests.",180.3
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"skyrim is fun and addicting, but the dungeons are too linear, puzzles are a bit easy, and the combat can be a bit dull. id give it an 8/10",142.8

"if youve ever played free roam games you probably think they are unexciteing undefined games like minecraft. well tkae this, with a map the size of tenesee hd graphics and interactability with nearly everything not to mention that it is modded by anyone form derogan to the next steam noob. this is by far the most complex game you have or ever will play. but let me warn you... this game is so detailed and life like that whenever my charictar died i almost had a heart attack seeing as to how into the game i felt. you will happily spend the rest of you pixilated life in skyrim. i would tell you more but i took and arrow to the knee. now i am just going to end this there because ive got some dragons to kill, untill next time. oh and if you dont like this game then ive got a list of swear words the size of skyrim just for you (trust me when i say that is one d*** long list)",331.3
"i do like the game but there are a few small bugs that you notice when you first start but as you play the game more you learn how to combat them but a bug that i have now discovered is that everything has dissapeard of the screen my compass,stamina,magica,health,subtitles and crosshairs along with the sneaking eye im not sure if it is a mod that is doing this but it works on a differant computer if anyone knows a fix for this i would like to hear it but other than that the game has been great the wolves falling out of the sky was a great thing as well (it was a bug that came with hearthfire after i had built my house) i would recommend if you have a mid end to high end pc otherwise it doesnt look that good nut is still a good game 7/10",186.0

"great game highly recommend. i have spent hours playing this game first on console then trransfered to pc, one of my personal favourites",14.6
"not a great fan of bethesdas work after the ruined my childhood years of gaming with fallout 3. bethesda does the standard bit in this game of hiring three or four voice actors to do a few hundred characters, and the whole mushy-irradiated-face you get to customize at the beginning. this game even comes with the standard bethesda dlc options that are downright unplayable by some estimation. so why am i giving a recommendation? steam workshop. the mod community, the gamers themselves, have seen the promise in this game and made it their own. as well, i can say this is the first bethesda game that has not out-right turned me away because i loathed the leveling system. i didnt like the idea of hopping around in the woods for 30 minutes in order to level stats. seemed stupid. however, this game has a decent leveling system and great mod support so you can have the adventure you crave.",159.3
"awesome game! i love this. the soundtrack is awesome too.",74.7
"i have spent 400+ hours on this game and i still havent done everything. if you like open world rpgs this game is amazing.",462.1
"its big, its open, and theres a lot to do. didnt find the main quest/story all too interesting as much as many of the side quests, its a bethesda game so you can count on glitches and bugs, and its almost heavily reliant on mods to keep it (more) interesting. its like skyrim, but its skyrim.",307.9
"open world full of adventure and wonder would remmcond 5/5",178.7

"amazingly fun, loads of quests and with the possibilities of the steam workshop anything is possible",199.8
"great game, it is so much more fun with all the dlcs try playing with some mods from the workshop and just have fun!",43.0
"i play this game too much...i love it that much. this is probably my second most played game of all time (after fallout 3 when i had the disk version) many hardcore elder scrolls fans call it watered down and dumbed down, i just think of it as simplified. i didnt like how stupidly complicated the skill system was in oblivion or morrowind, and the idea of missing a strike on something you obviously hit on your screen does not appeal to me. the best way to enjoy this game is to loadup on aesthetic/immersion mods first, and then get lots of great content mods to round it out.",958.9
"i have, in the past, always been a fallout fan and thought i would never give skyrim a chance. after recently picking it up in the winter sale, my mindset changed immediately. skyrim has to be one of the most in-depth and enthralling rpg experiences i have ever experienced and a game i would have payed full price for if id have known better. definitely suggest picking this one up if you have the money!",18.0

"the best open world rpg to date, it manages to surpass even the highly acclaimend tes iii morrowind with its depth in gameplay and how the world of skyrim reacts to the player and its actions. if you like any game in the tes series or open world rpgs in general you owe to yourself to play this game.",148.3
"very deep and immersive action rpg, the combat is quite challenging on the harder levels and super easy on the easiest settings so you can play as you like. theres a multitude of approaches to this game, you can sneak, go ranged, melee or use spells. mixes of fighting styles work also, you can even wear heavy armor while casting spells, if you practice hard :) dragons are beautiful in this game, excellently rendered. the only gripe i have is that they are quite easy to defeat, especially if you go into a tower. do familiarize yourself with the mods available for this game, theres literally hundreds of mods and many that will greatly enhance the skyrim experience. i do recommend playing the main storyline through before really diving into the game altering mods.",303.3
"ive play hours of this game on console too and it is a really good game to sink time into. its fun, you almost cant do all the missions and there are so many mods you almost cant get bored with this game",33.1
"gameplay: its classic tes gameplay, search, explore, kill with swords, magic and bows or a mixture. character builds are gone; just use the skill to level it up. dragons are powerful and epic and combat is, again not the best but classic tes. there must be close to 1000 or in todds words infinity quests for the player to do, he right you know too :) story: predictable but gripping and fun all the way. the main story has gotten rid of tedious missions and left only the raw and great missions. that said though it still look me 26 hours to complete the main storyline over 3 days and im not even close to the surface of the game. graphics: tes has not boasted about the graphics but on ultra high i was admiring the detail in every nook and cranny of the game, characters look realistic, everything just looks amazing!. easily in the top 5 best looking games ever. the game does suffer from a few bugs but a small price to pay. almost picture perfect 9.8/10 :d - dean buy this game, goty",376.2

"wow, cant begin to descibe how good this game is.... when i first heard about people talking about this game i automatically assumed they were nerds, but playing this doesnt make you feel like you are playing dungeons and dragons, or wow. it feels like you are another person, choosing your own path; slaughtering innocent townspeople, becoming a hero who wants to protect all that is right, or even becoming a master vampire and living out in the marsh with a house you built (dlc required). the landscapes are stunning, the ai is, i cant say the best, but compared to games like just cause 2 and and arma 2, they are much better. i spent 250 hours playing vanilla, and still have not completed the dawnguard questline as a dawnguard member, or finished the companion questline (i hate the companions if you buy the game hopefully you will agree with me), and still am doing quests. need cash and love killing? join the dark brotherhood, a ancient organization which carries out assinations. want to be a master wizard (you get to zap people with lightning and )? join the mage college of winterhold. after 250 hours i got mods which made the game so much better. buy it. stop wasting your time trying to find out if its good, because it is.",362.9

"this game is absolutely amazing. the massive open world, breathtaking quests, epic monsters, and the vast mod community truly makes this game one of the best rpgs if not games, in my opinion, available on steam. just the base game itself, without expansions, provides literally hundreds of hours of gameplay, and the mods on the steam workshop add even more. once you complete most of the game, you can literally download an entirely new game for free on the workshop. this is a fantastic deal for an awesome game.",318.2

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"insane amount of quests! almost from the get go, you are put on a path to... well.. to wherever is it you are going. either you stay focused with the main story line (yeah, right! as if it was even possible!) or you take off and do any of the other dozens of quests you always seem to have. awesome enchanting to make even the most mundane weapons pack a ton of heat and on and on. great game overall. get it.",128.4

"fun and entertaining, almost always something new to find or discover.",386.4
"i like this game because it has mind blowing graphics and so many things to do, if only i was good at it. everytime i am in combat with an enermy e.g ice troll, giant, ice wrath and dragon, dispite have gone to the secret item room and getting all the best weopons and armor, i still die, not even a daidric lord came help me. p.s. i alway have to get my friends to help/do it for me.",43.9
"purely for the sake of it being an elder scrolls game, im recomending this. it can be quite hilarious at times, and sometimes you can get really bored... which is when you can -really- have fun with it. you know, destroying a town, killing its people, leaving no one but the jarl and his court in tact.. and the children. (go download the mod to open killing on everything...) all in all, this game was good fun, and still is. it can get slightly tedius from time to time, but when youve finally lost all intrest in plaing fair, pull up the console! woo cheats!",115.2

"this is a great game it has a great story line, lots of action, and hours of gameplay, one of the best ive ever played",147.9
"skyrim is the perfect example of how a vast and addictive adventure game is done, without overloading the player with witcher-like  complexity. you begin the game picking only your race and from then, what type of fighter you are is completely built off of how you play, making for endless possibilities of the fighter you can become. it is a poor idea to just stick to the main story all throughout, because it will leave you at a disadvantage if you ignore the varying side quests and beautiful exploration, which allow you to uncover some of the best equipment as well as enhance your skills and levels. this in turn, has given me a massive playtime of 37 hours so far and the main story still only feels like its a quarter of the way through! this is a fantastic watercooler game, allowing for you and your friends to share hours of stories about your unique adventures and play style in skyrim. if you have the system specs and you love exploration, do not miss this game!",126.5

"one of my favorite games to date. you can literally play this game for months and not complete everything. you make make the game completely unique to how you want to play. got a little easy as you became more advanced and crafted higher items, making the fights a little less challenging. however the stories were always interesting and just the fact that i could make the game my own kept me coming. so many little secret areas and things to find. tons of side quests. amazing graphics. completely recommend.",122.8
"fantastic game, but my one criticism of it is that even now, it still has so many bugs! best advice i can give on this is to go download the unofficial, fan made patches. they fix all sorts of issues including things like quests not completing and the duplicated shout.",666.8
"this is the best rpg game ever. nothing comes close to it. 10/10 for sure.",190.4
"it is a good game but it is not working i have 88 hours tring to get in but it does not work .i have uninataled it and reinstaled it and it does not work it has been like this for two mounths and does not work.",104.4

"highly customizabe and fun. almost never gets old because adventures are to be had everyday!",135.5
"the best game of your life, period. there are no limits to what you can do. there is so much to do that i have come to the conclusion that this game cannot be 100% completed. with console commands, modability, and steam sales, the console versions simply do not compare. note with modding: i do not recommend the use of steam workshop. much of the work is outdated or not by the original user. check out the skyrim nexus and get the mod manager. it may not be as easy or convenient as the workshop, but it is easy nonetheless, and the website has 500% more mods than the workshop. it is all up to date well, for it is the modders prime place to post their work first. as an experienced modder, i recommend installing the following mods for a great start that will turn your game into a bluray quality eye-bleed: unofficial patches, project enb, hd2k, smim, and isokus mods. gophers youtube channel is the best source for step-by-step modding instructions.",297.9

"one of the best rpg games out there. you create your own character, choose a race and try to survive in the world of skyrim as dovakiin (dragonborn). your arsenal is swords, bows, spells, shouts and your own hands/claws. the unique feature in skyrim is the shouts. you use various shouts to your advantage that you learn from people or word walls. after learning shouts, you unlock them using dragon souls. to gain a dragon soul, you slain dragons that appear in the cities or in the wild. the world in skyrim is vast. there are a lot of places to discover, different people to meet, different factions to join and do a lot of quests. it takes a lot of time to do all quests, which is why this game lets you enjoy many hours of gameplay, unlike most of the game which people complete under 20-40 hours. although, skyrim has some bugs, creators still did an outstanding job in making this game. 9.8/10",86.1
"i highly recommend this game. as a legend of zelda gamer, loz should learn a few things from skyrim. everything is diversed. you are free to do whatever you want. may it be exploring, doing side-quest, main quest, or just view the beautiful scenery of skyrim. as the player character, you are the representation of the player. you can customize your character into whatever suits you. the game is a must have even up to todays standard. with mods you can literally play this forever.",32.6

"if your a fan of the single player rpg genre, then this is the game for you. amazing graphics, huge areas to explore, very nice gameplay, and endless hours of fun. i also suggest checking the elders scrolls online if your into the mmorpg genre, its coming up in april and it looks like it could be the game to end the wow era. the storyline is very compelling, even though u can be overwelmed by the amount of quests you have at some point, at least if u play like me who tries to be a perfectionist and talks and tries everything, but an amazing game overall. i advise you to buy it with all the expansion content (just for an amazing 19.90), and give it a go, you wont regret it.",54.2
"while the base game is fun it can be riddled with bugs and dry at times, however it proves to be a fun game after intensive modding. with such a open and expansive modding community it makes you forget about all the cracks this games armor",481.1
"ive only met a handful of people who didnt like this game, and they never really played more than 5 minutes of it. this is the game that got me into gaming deeper than i used to be. and i cant imagine there isnt something for everyone who might love it. from being able to customize your character, and change there look, to the fighting style. while the roleplaying isnt as great as mass effect, an open world game such as this does hold its own.",228.1
"best. game. ever. this is a game you could spend your whole life and playing and still not finish. its full of sidequests aswell as the free-roam which is never ending fun. i bought this game on pc and xbox 360 and finished the main games quest 14 times :d an absolutely must have ! 10/10",212.2

"this game is f*cking awesome! there is no better singleplayer game in the world. only thing i dont like on this game is there is some small bugs. and co-op multiplayer would be awesome on game like this.",60.9
"the most addictive & rewarding game i have played in a long time. it looks spectacular. i even spent days just wandering around looking at the scenery, discovering more and more as i went along. the main story arc offers months and months of gameplay especially when added to the numerous other storylines, be it the thieves guild, the dark brotherhood, the college at winterhold, the companions, the empire vs the stormcloaks war and more. how you to respond to the in-game characters dictates how they respond to you and allows you to access a multitude of side quests which keep you occupied as you continue on your epic journey. choose how you want to play... are you a warrior relying on your skills with weaponary of do you rely on magic to vanquish your foes? choose your follower, even get married and raise a family!! oh... and slay a few dragons on the way!! dont be fooled by the mere 42 hours i have played on steam... i have over 1000 hours of gameplay on the ps3 version. a game so good... i bought it again on pc. such a shame i dont own an xbox!! otherwise i would have completed the trifecta!!! highly recommended!!",44.5

"i bought skyrim on pc specifically to try modding it. there were a few things on the console version that i did not like, such as inventory sorting. anyway, modding the game lives up to the hype. it is a lengthy process to run 100 or so mods and an enb, but well worth it. i recommend people start with something i found called step (skyrim total enhancement project). im not going to link it, just do a search. skyrim is the best of the elder scroll series so far and everyone should play this game. it is that good!",85.8

"is a good over all game wityh grafics and gameplay being some of the hiest quality i seen but however often time the collor scal seems a bit mono tone and the capabilitys of the magic combat system will leave you lacking however that does not tack from this game in any way for you first to 3rd play thrue and will be barley noticed skyrims lockpicking skill is a step up from the one featured in oblivion giving a more imersive fealing as well as lot less randome titals and spells that are ether usless or are just cluter",452.6

"skyrim. a beautiful game where the scenery and wildlife are magnificent, but everything else wants you dead. im not joking, bandits, wolves, bears, trolls, dragons, cat people, mammoths, giants, vampires, wizards, and just all the inhabitants are so mean! you go outside in the morning of your house and a little girl asks if you can adopt her, you foolishly throw a fireball at her face and get arrested, you break out of jail and die because an unarmed person with barley any magic versus 30 guards is not going to end well. you are released from jail and on your way to your house, you are attacked by bounty hunters! you set them on fire while stabbing them brutally in the face and then return home, wake up in an abandoned shack where a murder cult kidnaps you and now you far from your house running from a dragon and taking shelter in a cave. you look for gold and 7 enormous spiders murder you and you re spawn all the way back when you were about to leave your house. and thats skyrim.",120.7
"the sequel we all hoped for. set in the beautiful, frozen, frigid north lands, in the same world as previous titles morrowind and oblivion. the player takes the role of a hero known as the dragonborn, a warrior with the body of a mortal but the soul of a dragon, whose destiny it is to destroy a great evil! that being said the game lends its self to moral ambiguity quite well. the player being able kill or help pretty much whoever he wishes, with your actions actually having an impact as you mold the world around you with your decision or indecision - this is of course the holy grail of any open world fantasy epic. a hardcore rpger wont enjoy that turning down missions your charcter wouldnt take on his chosen path of morality can cause you to miss out on some fun parts of the game. but hey! maybe try a second play through as a bad guy! skyrim really ticks almost all of the rpg boxes, want to fight dragons? demons? join a clan of wearwolves? maybe your prefer vampires? no problem! you want to be a career criminal? assasin? hunter? get married and build your own house? its literally all in here. with over 400 hours of game time so far i am still finding new areas, quests and things to explore. throw the workshop mods into the mix and this is a must have game that i believe will come to be regarded as a classic.",521.7

"skyrim is a bit confusing at first to someone who isnt familiar with the elder scrolls series or the rpg genre. thankfully, there are plenty of guides for the game, and talking to the characters in the game gradually helps explain what is going on. the area to explore seems huge and there seems so much to learn initally, but thats all done in an enjoyable way and the more you play, the more addictive it gets, and you want to see what is going to happen next. a good adventure.",49.4
"if i havent recommended this, i have already done so in my heart and mind. an open world rpg, with thousands of mods to change anything you desire in the game - great graphics, a solid story, tons upon tons of side quest material and hundreds of fun hours. honestly what is not to like about this gem of a game`? heck even if there is something you dont like - just change it with a mod :d its an rpg must own and it cannot be praised enough. buy it, play it, love it - and then go change it into something else and play it again!",204.0

"freaking awesome game, could be better character customization, because it seems like only nord women are beautiful. but i would like to have beautiful elves and other races too. several glitches on quest completion and werewolf forms, pisses me off that they cannot access equipment or map, or even fast travel, they cannot loot as well. same with vampires. but the game overal has plenty nice rare items, which are beautiful, graphics amazing totally 9/10",119.7

"now ive played the previous oblivion only! and i enjoyed that game alot with the mods and story board, the engine and graphics were decent....as were my computer specs so i couldnt complain! point was it was playable on any machine and it was fun! wait for this game to come out i have played it on ps3 and now steam. it is one of the best offline rpgs i ahve ever played... althought i still dont get the buzz i get when i played oblivion... skyrim offers top graphics and if your not satisfied with that.... you have mods to boost up the graphics! the story board is creative and amazing. the engine is much better than the oblivion engine however it still have the stealing weird thing where if u steal something some guard who never saw you would come to you and ask you to go to prison. apart from all that i would give it a 9/10 as it is unique...almost niche in its way of entertaining the player and still has that essence of elder scrolls!",30.6

"the only downside is that whenever i install this game again i have to install a hundred mods. ok, theres also the downside that i feel its a bit monotone compared to some other rpgs and i dont often feel invested in nps. but its skyrim and ive also put in probably 40 more hours than listed here before i had it on steam. i played through the main quest and some others and enjoyed myself every time i played. had to make a call to try and complete other games instead of just putting in 300 hours here.",81.6
"truthfully the best game rpg game i have ever played. totally worth every cent.",52.8
"i recommend skyrim for those who want an rpg with endless possibilities. why because modders never stops developing new mods everyday, every week. you can find mods that gives you new land and adventures, skin and other important aspect to improve your skyrim from vanilla to actually new game, i can see this reason why bethesda drops any updates for this game because, modders already got it better than what they had been created. so finally, all i can say is this is a must-have game and you will never ever ever regret owning skyrim.",235.7

"amazing game. so many different things to do that it would take hundreds of hours to complete it all, and that is just without mods. there is such and extensive mod collection for this game. some mods are even as big as the dlc for this game which i would also reccamend. if you own a pc and do not own skyrim you are doing something wrong",100.9
"wonderful modding community and pretty good story.",33.6

"well, ign already did the mostpart of this for me. this game delivers everything youd want from any game. ever. with stunning graphics and overall complexity, this game delivers an absolutely monumental storyline with endless quests and side missions! bethesda spent so much time dealing with this, and whatever they did, they did it well. with the beautiful resolution from this game, you can make even the simplest landscapes look like the most tremendous sceneries, that really create a sense of depth and diversity. bethesda, you have made a truly unforgettable game, and anyone that disagrees with that, has to re-think their entire lives. 10/10",7.6

"there are not many words that i can use to describe one of the best games ive played. this game tells a simple tell that thousands of years have lead up to. taking your time to explore all the little details that have been put into the games is just one of them many awesome things skyrim dose well. if you dont have this game yet, your missing out of history in the making.",275.2

"i played skyrim for a few days solid. then not much after that. skyrim, i feel, suffers from the sheer amount of stuff to do which kind of ends up being fetch quests. too many quests and too many places to go for too petty of an objective. skyrims greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. its so huge and theres so much to do, theres nothing to do.",97.6

"first of all, i wanted to say that when i first bought it, i didnt play it for about 2 weeks (i had it installed and all), but then one day i thought, well what the hell ill give it a try, at first i thought well this might get booring because i pretty much know the storyline because ive seen multiple walkthroughs (mainly seamus o doherty - ssoh) and playing for about 3 hours it started getting really addictive, for the first week that i played i already had about 60 hours of gameplay, im not even half way through, 100hours of gameplay and im still trying not to get too carried away as i usually spend 5 hours playing in a row if i decide to play it at all. all in all, its really addictive, it looks real good, works well even on low-end desktops (maybe not at all on low-end laptops) and gameplay is actually pretty good, it does get quite repetetive, but its enjoyable.",132.7
"hands down amazing. the immersive gameplay is to die for, the in-game visuals are stunning, and the combat system is top-notch. the game is never the same each time you play it. this is, and always shall be, one of my favorite games.",442.3

"i was excpeting a lot from this game considering his reputation. lets say it was a huge disapointenment where after hours of issue with modding etc, i played a boring game full of glitch where i spend most of my time just travelling. the controls and the menues/ui are designed for console and honestly the graphics are really not that great. well it might be a good rpg for older consoles i guess..",4.8
"it is an amazing role playing game (rpg), with an interesting storyline - linking with other elder scrolls games containing refernces and a beautiful enviroment with snowy hills and mountains and dense forests with exotic plants and creatures lurking around such as trolls and wolves all over the place. this is truly an adventurous and brilliant game.",3.0

"a game like skyrim almost recommends itself, with not just the potential but the expectation for hundreds of hours of gameplay, a huge, huge world and an endless amount of quests its really not difficult to see why its so popular. thankfully, its not underserved in the slightest. essentially, if youre looking for an rpg, or if youve played an elder scrolls game before you should absolutely buy this game. and if youre not much into rpgs, and especially if you want to get started, skyrim is a fantastic way to start.",217.5
"one of my favorite games of all time. the modding community is great, but the game doesnt even need it. it is a very immersive game, that doesnt restrict you on what to do when to do it. if you dont want to do a quest, you can simple ignore it. you are dovahkiin(dragonborn), you find that out after you fight your first dragon. the story is rather short it makes up for it in the countless hours on shenanigans and lollygagging. your character seems unrealisticly special throughout the game. what i mean by that is you become the top of every class and yet you are still just another adventurer. the game is beautiful, and just worth your time. this game was release 11-11-11 and it still is one of the best games of the decade. the game is a must buy, even if you dont like rpgs genre. i am sure you may come out of your shell and let your inter nerd come out and become all powerful! youre going to try to sell me something. well, i aint interested. olda 10/10",180.8

"this game is one of the best rpg games ever! the story itself is quite lackluster (main only) but the things that follow from the story after its done is extremely interesting. i myself do not have the strongest pc a mediocore pc i might say. the game runs at around 40 fps at ultra and its not needed to run at a high fps since its a rpg. this game right not is on a mega sale so get it definetly if youre looking for an excellent rpg, many interesting stories and it runs well on lower pcs. 10/10",86.9
"ive grown up on the elder scrolls series, and put in hundreds of hours on this game. bethesda games tend to be a little bugged and always have some game breaking mechanic (crafting trees im looking at you.), but the pc version of this game is definitely worth getting. the mods in the workshop alone, excluding nexus mods, make this game so much better than the console version. 5 out of 5 gamers would play again. such game. much good. very doge.",123.9

"if you have been living under a rock for the past 3 years or so, you might not have heard of skyrim, but it is simply a great game. with the right selection of graphical mods (thank the lord for the pc and the ease of installing mods on steam!) it even looks the part of a next-gen game. i normally dont like rpgs because they dont give me much in return for the hundreds of hours you have to sink into it. but this is a game, that not only is an rpg, but it is one of my favorite games. just the amount of detail and vastness put into the world of skyrim is astonishing and awe-inspiring. i have undoubtedly sunk more time into this game than should be advised, but by god i dont regret a second of it.",110.2

"skyrim is very fun, even though with all of the hours ive put in it ive never beaten the main story, because there are so many other things to do in the game. ill get around to it some day.",136.4
"what can i say ? get this game enough said :) 10/10",270.7
"its a really fun game i recommed it and i only havea laptop not a gmaing one or anything but it runs perfecly fine. i did run into a problem i dont know if its just my laptop but i installed 2 mods from the workshop and my game wouldent lod it was just black scree and in task manger it said not responding. over all its a very good game and if you have a laptop thats not a gmaing one you can still enjoy the game but of course not on 1080p graphics.",35.0
"if this game has taught me anything, its that dragons are far less dangerous than made out to be. instead i think we need a mammothborn. 10/10",160.2
"one of the best games out there. couldve had better fighting physics, instead of swords just slicing through people. 5/5",296.5
"this game is great the gameplay is so enjoyible and the story is good. the side missions are very fun. the audio and vocie acting is great. the textures are a bit blocky but you cant really notice. i recommend this game. 9.5/10",12.8
"great game made even better by an amazing mod community.",286.1
"ill admit, at first when i heard of the game it didnt seem as interesting, thought it would be like the rest that claims to be epic when its not. but over time i saw my friends play it, and when i looked it up for a voicepak project i was working on, i was wrong... the game was something i was actually expecting in a game: no ending point, full customization, the ability to fight in 1st person with any weapon, outstanding music, ability to make potions, armor, weapons and food like in mmo games, and a great storyline with many branching quests. all in single player! i never got the dlc yet, but i can already tell itll make the game worth every cent its worth! too addicting. even the mods make the game fun. never gets old with a character with wings. especially if killed by a giant! (flying in the air always cracks me up. xp) screw the 10/10 rating, and even the 20/10 rating... it deserves the 50/10 rating!! best rpg game ever on steam!",963.9
"i recommend skyrim because there are so many story arcs to participate in and plenty of really cool areas and the scenary is just beautiful. there are some bugs and if you cant get the game to load after modding it take off all mods then load the game and try different mods see which ones work. the map is a good size to have an amazing adventure! i love the level up system in this game because it is so easy! one thing i dont like is having to choose sides in the war. however, if you choose imperial it is beneficial to the dark brotherhood quest line. the enemies were pretty cool for being randomly generated and rather tough in some cases (giants, frost trolls, trolls, etc.).",744.7
"if you like to wander the world, explore, adventure, and learn, this is your game. the moment you hit the great outdoors, theres a vast expanse of wilderness and towns to discover. ancient ruins and moldering caves will also tempt you. what makes the game particularly good is the conversations with inhabitants. the amount of dialog and stories these characters posses is astonishing. the game may be a few years old, but it holds up well (particularly if you add some of the community mods)!",487.0
"its a excellent game. you cant lose it, if youll find a game that have a giant adventure and epic journey in one of the most epic adventures of all time.",212.8
"great game. skyrim is beautiful and vast. exploration and dungeon crawling and figthing is very fun. the story is pretty basic, and its a lot better than the doorknob level of complexity of oblivion but it still doesnt live up to the awesome sauce of morrowind. the ui has been gimped to accomodate gamepad console gamers too, so thats very dissapointing. having said all that, its still a blast to play and i sunk about 140 hours into it (without any dlc).",159.8
"this is likely my favorite game of all time. fantastic out of the box, and with mods from the skyrim nexus (preferable to steam community) you can breathe constant new life into it whenever and however you want. the modding community for this game is still going very strong, if not stronger than ever, since its release three years ago.",505.4

"5 days after buying it, i got 100 hours in it. mods are love, mods are life.",882.7
"i gotta say i am a big elder scrolls fan but skyrim is beyond perfect.i played about 50 hours in the last 2 weeks and i love it so much.this game has got sooo much replay value and is my favs rpg of all time.i mean in which game can you be a werewolf,buy houses.adopt children,marry,buld houses,ride a motherf***ing dragon,fight dragons absorb their souls,unlock shouts,smith weaponsand more,yeah you guessed it skrim.oh ,yeah and be a vampire lord.i freakin loovvee this game.sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo awesooommmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeee!!!!",168.7
"make waifus and husbandos and go hunt wolves and draugr in this epic tundra simulation.",1070.4
"this game is the closest thing to living out my fantasy of being conan the destroyer. combat is highly satisfying. dungeons and enemies get repetitive but not unbearable. the world of skyrim is beautiful, the npcs are believable. your first time with a dragon is as intense as it should be.",29.6
"its simple everyone doesnt know a good game until they played this one probably one of the best games of our generation",6.9
"personal rating: 9/10 this game, beautiful. i played the hell out of it on xbox and im looking forward to playing the game with mods on this time. the mods give the game endless possibilites, just like left 4 dead 2 or garrys mod. finished all the quests? workshop. sick of the same items? workshop. want a flying house? workshop. do you see what im getting at here? general opinion. of course, these hand made items dont always work but the majority of the good ones do and when they do work its a hell of a time to be had. but one thing is for sure, the game is far from perfect on the glitch front. in the small amount of time ive played the pc version ive seen a floating guard who took out a dragon and then fell to his death, giving me free loot from the dragon and his corpse. a very fun game and experience to have.",24.1
"i love this game. i play it all the time, but i do have a few issues...i fricking love riften,. but the lag in riften. wtf? i think, bethesda, that you did a wonderful job. i recognise that in a game as big as this, there will be both lag and bugs. but i also believe that if you had time to make an hd texture pack, you can make an fps dlc.",144.6
"if you got some spare money and time and want an awesome rpg experience,definetly pick up skyrim.",119.7
"its a pretty bland game on its own and honestly i wouldnt have put even close to a quarter of the hours i have put into it if it werent for mods. i recommend it, but only on the basis of being able to get mods to make it better.",305.0
"if you want a game that you can play for hours and hours and hours, and then just stop for a long time, and then come back to and play again for hours and hours and hours, then this is the game for you! the only reason not to buy it, is if you dont want to slay dragons and be awesome!",108.6
"10 out of 10 must have,2 years passed and i still play it.",289.3
"if you like a non-linear game experience, this is the game for you. follow the quest line, or go off and see the world. hours and hours of game play. check out the steam workshop for all of the mods. refine the game for your style of play. skyrim is not just a game, its a way of life.",356.7
"thoroughly enjoyed the game. it has a brilliant open world experience and i felt free to do whatever i pleased. i highly recommend this as a roleplaying game and open world game to everyone and anyone.",497.6
"the best option for an open world fantasy game you can get on steam. fantastically executed and true to the world of the elder scrolls. ive spent many hours just wandering skyrim. what you get out of this game comes from what you put into it. i found it a lot more satisfying to give my characters their own backstories in order to justify what i was doing. dont let the sometimes amusing glitches get in your way and you can see why this game was so talked aobut at its release. also, why dont you own it yet?",324.7
"its a fun game and has a lot of quests to play to make a different character do different things then the first.",33.2
"my opinion: -game of the year 2012 -game of the year 2013 -game of the year 2014 -game of the year 2015 -game of the year 2890 epic game that can give hundreds of hours of gameplay, and when you get bored just download mods out of the thousands upon thousands of mods out there on steam workshop.",846.3
"hands down the biggest, baddest dungeon crawlinest elder scrolls game to date. between modding and the steam workshop, the game has been expanded to include a rediculous amount of updrades to the lighting, textures, ai, npcs, models, weapons, ui, and some even add entirely new locations and quests for hours of extra gameplay. a must have for anyone who enjoys rpgs.",156.2
"awesome game, with all the new games out now and i still come back to skyrim. hands down my favourite game",207.6
"amazing. simply amazing. not only when you get done, but from the start. amazing.",60.1
"this game is just so fantastic, i dont know where to start. lets see, this game is absolutely beautiful. this water looks great, the armor looks great, and the entire environment of the game is just amazing. it has a good combat system, and the first-and-third-person views add more detail into the game. and the race selections. most other rpgs mostly just have humans as their man race to choose from, which is booooooooring. but in this game, you can be a cat man, or a lizard man, or you can be elves if thats more your cup of tea. the story and questlines add more depth into it, too. overall, great game, great graphics, great gameplay, amazing game.",70.2
"pretty overrated but still a great game, a satisfying experience for the rpg hungry, nothing at all to regret here",101.5
"possibly the greatest open world roleplaying game ever created. beautiful atmosphere and brilliant design. definitely something worth buying! 10/10",203.0

"if you have a lot of time on your hands and dont mind walking halfway across the earth, this is the game for you.",119.5
"skyrim has got to be one of my favorite games of all time. bethesda always delivers in their games and does an excellent job enriching their open worlds with so much to do. i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves rpgs, or even those skeptics.",33.9
"has chickens and dragons what more could you want?",4.2
"skyrim... where to begin? after countless hours of gameplay this game can still be just as entertaining as it was on day 1 (with the help of the endless mods for it of course) but if you havent played it before this game is the definitive rpg, after a brief tutorial quest you are literally thrown into the world of skyrim free to do whatever your heart desires. it has an extremely high replay value well worth the money, this game will undoubtedly provide hours upon hours of fun.",158.7
"epic rpg! whats more important is that steam workshop makes installing mod become very easy and safety.",210.0
"awesome game very fun even those i dont play it as much as i used to its very fun",5.0
"love the graphics, the voice acting, the side quests, the combat mechanics, the dungeons, the caves, the creatures and animals and mammoths and giants, the songs sung by npcs, the crafting, the chicken hunting, the fusrodah-ing, and everything else about this game. then i hit 75 hours of playtime, and decided ive had enough and got bored of it all. such a pity i never went far in the main quest storyline. would definitely come back to finish the main quest, one day.",77.1
"understandably its not as *good* as oblivion but skyrim itself is an artistic/gameplay masterpiece. if you ever want to sink into a game for hours on end skyrims your game. i highly advise buying it if you havnt already. ~ 2k + hours on console",70.9
"i really love this game. the mods u can down load from the community is mind blowing.",176.3
"went to an orphanage. took my sword out. killed all the children there. 10/10 - ign would kill children again.",8.4
"not only is there an amazing amount of quality gameplay, but skyrim has one of the best modding communities on steam. youll never run out of quests, adventures, or the ability to call trains from the sky.",382.0
"an awesome game overall! a lot of depth into the story and multiple quests that will keep you on your screen for a long time. the only minor drawback is the multiple bugs and glitches which may hinder your progression into the storyline.",338.9

"so much better than its console counterpart. load times greatly reduced to almost instant, graphics are beautiful along with the high resolution texture pack. the game itself sets a new level of quality for bethesdas rpgs. provides hundreds of hours of immersive gameplay, great story, intense combat and lots to do. the steam workshop now provides a easy, user friendly way to mod. looking forward to more dlc like oblivions shivering isles.",236.6
"this is a fantastic i would recommand this game to every one who likes free to rome games.",112.6
"not completely awful, but overhyped as hell and gets old really fast.",17.9
"skyrim is another world better then this one in so many ways, you really do live another life. i always thught skyrim was just another bad aaa game then one day i saw the witcher 2 on sale so i added founds to my steam for the first time and i got it, then i saw g-mod witcher 1 and darksouls 1 and got then too but then i saw skyrim i didnt expect to like it but i got it... i fell in love. i have played over 850 hours of skyrim i have gotten all 75 achievements the level 5 badge all the emoticons and backgrounds, skyrim is one of my top 3 games of all time. if you see this game on sale buy it. i will never forget! i am harbinger!, i am nightingale!, i am arch-mage!, i am dawnguard!, i am legate!, i am dragonborn!.",952.9
"all of oblivions flaws were perfected in the elder scrolls v: skyrim. the magic system is much more appealing than it was in oblivion and the various approaches to a battle are more balanced than ever. the music is incredible to say the least and the graphics are mind-blowing. bethesda also improved their reputation by removing the technical issues that are normally sprinkled in their games. this is an easy recommendation to any gamer out there looking for an awesome game. gameplay: 19/20 ... awesome (the bugs with the dragons and the quantity over quality concept is annoying) story: 8/10 ... great graphics: 5/5 ... perfect sound/music: 5/5 ... flawless (so epic...) controls 5/5 ... perfect overall: 93% (42/45) ... awesome",347.6
"amazing, and the workshop makes is great for new modders ^^",97.7
"an awesome game, despite what people say about being dumbed down from its predicessors morrowind and oblivion, its still a great game!!",471.7
"the most amazing epic fantasy adventure with some bugs and some annoying things ... but who cares. :p i never ever played something like this. (except oblivion but skyrim is more beautiful than that xd) huge world, exciting quests and unlimited gameplay with mods. recommended to try playing without them and highly recommended try as many as you can ... that is another dimension of the game. a deep ,captivating dimension of skyrim. :) without mods : 98% with mods : 200%",194.4
"so... this is probably the best single-player pc action rpg ive played. am at about 60 hours and am finally wrapping up the main storyline (only got mildly sidetracked by two other major plot lines). a lot of the cheese from oblivion is gone, and along with it a lot of the annoyances. overall, skyrim is a remarkably polished experience and a welcome addition to the franchise. apart from the sheer breadth of the world and thus its comparative lack of depth along individual paths, and the problem that all really open-world games eventually encounter with players outleveling and trivializing even scaled content... the biggest problem with skyrim is its control scheme, which still suffers a bit from being designed with a console controller in mind.",126.6
"easily scores on my top 10 games of all time, a brilliant action rpg that provides a true nonlinear experience. the game does not give a sh*t when sully your reputation. friendly fire exists and even crucial plot members can die or hate you. this gives you amazing opporunities to be a complete  or a god send to the people of skyrim. that gets to my next point on how good the npc system is. coming back to my last point in how you can sully your reputation, you can buy simply talking to them, thats right, many of the npcs have multiple pathways of chatter, this allows an even bigger nonlinear feel than it already has. let us not forget about the epic battles as well. they, are, epic, to avoid spoiling anything thats all im going to say.so overall we have one of the most nonlinear rpg of all time, a somewhat challenging auhority (early game) unlike other open world games i know *cough* gta *cough*. this holds a solid spot of #7 on my top 10 best games of all time.",117.7
"really nice game. loads of quality graphics and fast paced gameplay. console commands and mods supported too :-) downloadable expansion content availible and a fully interactive and massive world to explore. smart npcs and tactical enemies. great game!",113.8

"fantastic rpg/action/adventure game. its got an ample amount of places to explore and things to do. theres plenty of quests and sidequests to take on. the game can also be pretty challenging depending on where you are, how powerful you are, etc. you will happily lose 100+ hours into this great game.",409.0
"i was playing this game when it first came out and here we are in 2014 and i am still not bored of it. there is literally so much to do and so many ways to play this game however you want to. i have spent hours, weeks, months on this game (on all platforms) and my time was very well spent in my opinion. even with completing the game so many times and getting all of the achievements, i still find myself having an urge to open it up and play. have a social life? you wont after this! lol, just remember to call your loved ones once in a while and let them know you are still alive. :p",329.9

"dear god... this game is the definition of awesome. just remember not to kill your wife.",429.2
"explore. fight. speak to random people, and perform arbitrary tasks. theres some story involved, but frankly its both poorly written and executed. this is perhaps intentional, as skyrims greatest asset is the freedom to explore. too bad the combat system awful.",337.8

"i really wanted to love skyrim. but i couldnt. we were promised a living, breathing world with an epic story and millions of quests to fulfill. however, what i feel skyrim amounts to is a dull, samey experience. no rpg elements, low enemy and equipment diversity and a lackluster story make skyrim boring and see-through. i can see where an amazing game may have been birthed from what exists, but it never happened. stick to oblivion and the fallout series. avoid skyrim if you enjoy rpgs. however, if you like action games, this ones for you.",63.8

"you know you played too long when your mom enters the room and you make your game character look to the door. 10/10 the radiant ai bethesda developed for their games makes skyrim really immersive making you feel like you were part of the game. npcs react to the environment and to the player in a very dynamic way. there are 95 random encounters you can find travelling from a city to another and they always fill the lore, some even get a small backstory, thats why i decided to not use the fast travel option and always go walking; the beautiful landscape will definitely make most people do this as well.",138.5

"this game is amazing! the story line is very detailed (just like the textures) and very long. it can be difficult at times, but the side quests, and they have a ton of them, can raise your level, get you new weapons and armors, and help you beat that main story quest line! they have an inventory system where you can only carry a certain amount of items before you cant run because it is too heavy, and the magic system has a menu where you can select a shout and spells! you can favorite both and open the favorites menu in battle and equip a spell, weapon, or an item. you can unlock shouts by collecting dragon souls, which come from dragons once you kill them. dragons will randomly appear. you could also become a vampire or a werewolf! as you can see, there are many things to do in skyrim, so i would rate it a 10 out of 10!",313.8

"wander the open world of skyrim as you, the dragonborn, use your awesome magical gift of the ancient language to: steal cabbages, steal horses, pick pockets, pick locks, and even rob shops at night! still be the hero as you kill off an entire empire such as the stormcloaks or the imperials. hunt through the ancient ruins of nords and fight through armies of zombies just to get bored in the end and murder everyone in windhelm just for the hell of it.",132.1
"a timeless game with good rpg elements and gameplay storyline that will last years",742.6
"love it.best time i have had since oblivion. just wish they would add first person horse riding",103.7
"great game. by itself, a game that you could play for almost ever. but with the modding you cant stop playing. the game is what you would thing it would be for an elder scrolls, but it was a few things that make it stand out. for example, in games like oblivion you define you character right at the start. in skyrim you grow into the all powerful being. and because its not a multiplayer game (thank god) you can be as over powered as you want. it also has a huge map, and if you install the dlc then the area in even larger. but really this gameis about modding. and thats what makes it fun. mod. everything. steam even gives you the choice of downloading the modding tool. the only bad thing i can say is that if you dont have a pretty good pc then you might be a little disappointed that you arent getting the pretty-nes that you want. great game. 9.7/10",78.5
"in a lot of ways, it is a typical open-world game: there are missions you can go on, if you chose to accept them; there are no level restrictions to certain areas; you are free to level up your character as desired with no pre-set formats. in other ways, the game can be a bit tedious: the combat is not that complex; archery is a bit over powered; and the skills system is mundane to level up (you either gain skill points by using the skill or purchase them from trainers). but that said, i love this game, a fact evidenced by the almost 300 hours ive spent playing this game. the level of detail to the environment and atmosphere is tremendous. the ability to mod the game, and the mods that have come out, its what truly give this game its beauty. if you are the kind of person that loves expansive, immersive environments, you must have this game. if you are a game-lore nerd, you must buy this game.",293.8
"i killed a train with a salami. real life now seems dull and trivial. 10/10",95.7
"this game is by far a game that all pepol can love. you can go into a random dungeon and boom boss+ sidequest nad not just sidequest like oh i guess i need dis item go get it for me no. more like oh hey this dog can talk let me help it get back to its master and that get a glowing acient axe. and yes that is a sidequest. and a game with dragons cant be bad so... go buy dis",183.3
"this is by far one of the best games i have ever played!",22.4
"will update review later. as of now, its excellent. its skyrim. :d",114.0
"a masterpiece, a must and a great adventure ahead. this game is almost infinite, you have so many things to do that at some point you will be overwhelmed by missions, a map big as hell, beautiful landscapes that will marvel you, you wont be dissapointed at all. maybe a bad thing are the crashes that some times happen during gameplay, but they are a minor detail next to the great storyline and adventures this game has to offer. totally recommended!",230.9
"this game is a must have for all pc gamers. there is a wealth of mods. the vanilla game is stellar as well. get it when its on sale! 9/10",120.6
"how can you not love this game. you can literally play it forever dont get me started o the mods :p mods make pc skyrim the best ever and cane enhance gameplay and make it last so much longer",404.6
"ive lost way too much of my life to this game. that said, id absolutely suggest that everyone else should do the same. skyrim spent quite a while in production, and it shows. the world is absolutely beautiful, and the gameplay is just awesome. if youre hesitant to spend the money, i assure you that its worth it; there are hours upon hours of content, and id say that it also has a good replay value.",194.0
"this game is amazing, no issues at all. you enter a cave and you fight giant creatures such as spiders. or maybe its a gang hideout and you were paid by the guard to take out the gang, and you see they have slaves, you can free them. though in the outcome of all your choices dont affect the end of the game, you can see it through the villagers eyes. they will idolize you or hate you or just plainly hear your name and attack you. and after all the amazing sceneries, fights, and dlc..... there is mods. and once you played this game to its last minute try other games like the fallout franchise or oblivion the one before skyrim. 10/10 - waffles book",10.9
"this game is so fun especially with mods to make it even better, its a must play!",31.0
"buggy, and bethsoft has this odd ability to seemingly break this game more with every patch (ok, yes, they do fix some things...sometimes...but it sure seems like the three stooges or the keystone cops are doing the patching now and then). *edit* get the unofficial patches from skyrim nexus. that is all. *edit* despite this, its amazingly deep and stupidly engrossing. buy this, and prepare to say goodbye to your loved ones, friends, and free time. ...at least until it crashes. again.",745.4
"i had this on xbox way back before i got a good computer and put 60 hours into it. now i have put 51 hours into it here so i feel like yeah, i should say this is a good game",94.7
"never thought that there would be a game who can excite me as much as the elder scrolls iv oblivion, but bethesda did it again and made a much more awesome game. the game is nice itself, but you can get the most beatuy out oft it with mods. and because of the skyrim community there are more than enough out there for it.",597.1
"great game, but gets a bit boring when you get a weapon that does over 500 damage per hit and youre able to kill everything in 1 - 2 hits. mods however remedy this, even if they may make the game a bit more unstable.",861.8

"dragons, arrows in knees, fus ro dah, curved swords...curved. swords. sorry lass, i dont have time to talk right now, come back another time, no lollygaggin, let me guess someone stole your sweetroll. ect ect.",226.7
"why dont you have it yet?! have you been living under a rock?! if you have then pay attention because you will want to get this game. this game is amazing -- if you couldnt tell already -- for a couple reasons. the environment is amazing, it makes you feel like you are actually there in the forests and mountains. the amount of detail that went into making the environments is commendable because it really gives the game a sense of being which is something other bethesada games did lack a bit. combat has been enhanced and now being a mage is a viable choice to make. spells are diverse not just in damage and effects but visually as well. you can throw ice spear, frost storms, fireballs, lightning bolts, create cloaks of energy and thats just the destruction spells. stealth is much more tuned as well with a whole skill tree to accompany it. make pickpocketing easier or make yourself practically invisible. inventory has been upgraded to be easier to manage. verdict: get it!",163.2
"the rpg to end all rpgs. it took me 150 hours, and 5 different characters before i got around to finishing the main storyline. there is simply so much to do, almost too much for someone used to plot-driven games like mass effect. so incredibly fun and immersive, and the graphics are second to none.",165.5

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim ein klasse spiel mit sehr langer spielzeit, vielfalt und detailverliebtheit. das spielen macht eine mordsmigen spa und es wird auch nicht langweilig, weil an jeder ecke eine neue quest auf dich wartet. grafisch ist das echt inordnung und ist mit anderen triple a titeln gleich auf. das gesamt paket gefllt mir und bekommt deshalb 95 von 100 punkten: the elder scrolls v: skyrim its a very good game with a long gametime. there are quests at every corner and you cant stop gaming if you played skyrim one time. the graphics are very good and i didnt find a lot of bugs. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is as good as another triple a titles like far cry 3 or assasins creed 3. if i could rate this game i would give 95% of 100%.",99.5
"this game is so much more than i expected. i thought it was just going to be a game about stupid dragons but it turns out i can attack anyone i want, steal stuff, and set everything on fire! 10/10 perfect.",313.1
"what more can be said about skyrim? in my opinion its the best bethesda game ever made, which also makes it one of the best open world games ever made. its aged a bit since release, but its still gorgeous. the amount of things to see and do is staggering; my first playthrough of the campaign totalled 80 hours and i still hadnt seen half of the content. skyrim was also a cultural phenomenon, sparking internet memes left and right that will be remembered for years. if you havent played it, youre missing out.",18.8
"despite having all the system requirements, had it checked by a profeesional so my computer is 100% able to gun this game, it has no problems according to the packaging for running on my pc, despite this it keeps crashing after hte first scene at the execution scene, pile of rubbish dont buy!!!!!!!",388.4
"so basically what you do in this game is you run around with a really big modded sword (cause thats like the only reason to get it on pc) and slay everything in sight. i.e. dragons, trolls, bandits, forsworn, horses, ice wraiths, spiders, dogs, friends, family, sometimes yourself, ghosts, some more dragons (cause thats the point to this game), guards, vampires, wearwolves, etc. basically everything except children cause thats wrong and you should feel bad for trying. 10/10 would recommend always.",168.9

"i waited a few years before i picked this up in a steam sale but it actually suprised me as fantasy rpg games have never really stiffened my . i enjoyed the magic, weapons, herbs, spells and general task management of the game. graphics are pretty good. my only complaint is that you cant fight in armies and dungeon raiding soon gets old. worth a punt if leather and burning people turns you on.",52.0

(because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",68.4

"i recommend the game because its fun and there is alot of stuff you can do but the game is kinda short. -spoiler- i completed the game while completeing the entire stormcloak missions within a week, but the game is really fun of all the side quests and mods you can play with and all the races. the charater customization is alot it isnt reccomended for blue eyes cause if you want blue eyes you gotta have 1 of them looking a bit gray cause its blind.",122.7
"most epic game ive ever seen. i played now over 50 hours and i didnt even made 20%. i enjoy every little thing, i explore much and talk to everyone and everything but even without beeing that meticulous you will need very long to see everything. the game is yours, you can do what you want whenever you want. you can follow the quests, you can totally ignore the quests. your decisions almost have no limits. there is so much stuff to collect, you will totally lost control of your inventory. behind almost every npc is a sidequest. i have atm ~30 quests open + ~50 little miscellaneous quests and i finished ~50 and as i said, not even 20% of the story is made. you can buy houses, interior, horses, dogs and you can marry someone. you can fight with 2 weapons / 2 hands at the same time. you can do the same work as everyone else in the game. like lumberjack, smith, farmer, thief and more. the dragons are awesome and they appear random. game has some little bugs. still 10/10",221.2
"dont get me wrong, this game is amazing, and it completely ruined my life. i love it. thing is, steam went along and decided to make the game crash on startup every damn time i use it. it worked fine for about a year, more than fine really, but then the dreaded day came. 1 file failed to validate. crash again. 1 file failed to validate. until steam gets their  together with this, i wouldnt reccomend buying it. for the many who already bought it and suffer from this monstrosity, welcome to hell.",133.6
"really fun, really open. the only thing i wasnt too happy about was the good/bad split wasnt always right. every action was a little bit good and a little bit bad in weird ways, and it always felt like there should be other options that the game simply didnt even acknowledge. there was no option to buy out the assassins guild to take out the blackbriars and liberate riften, or reach the top of the thieves guild, and use that to curb their excesses and teach them not to s%@1 where they eat. the game, vanilla, is still like hundreds of hours of awesome fun, and then the steam workshop makes it easy to add hundreds more.",75.0
"step 1: complete the game. step 2: regret not buying all dlcs. step 3: buy all dlcs, and mod the game so much, that it looks better than games made in 2015. step 4: complete game one more time, this time walking around and watching freaking chickens. step 5: realize that this is the best (that type of) game that youve ever played.",78.1

"i tried oblivion very late into the game, only a couple of months before skyrim was released and to tell you the truth i disliked it. a couple of years prior i also played bethesdas newest game: fallout 3 and couldnt get into that as well; however, skyrim was a brilliant masterpeice of a game that really was my first proper rpg. i have spen collectively over a hundred hours playing this game(i got it first on console) and there is still much more to do. there is a play style for any type of player. after getting this i would strongly suggest buying fallout 3, and new vegas as going back to that franchise with skyrim still on my mind has made me a fan of that series as well. be warned there are a lot of bugs in bethesda games, small and game breaking. p.s. the modssssss 9/10",36.3

"never been into the whole skyrim craze since its came out. hearing other peole say they love it all the time.... they finally wore on me and i gave it a try, its outstanding! you never know what your missing until you give it a try. skyrim has pleased my need for a role playing adventure game simular to fallout 3 & new vagas and with all the freedom to mod skyrim how ever the heck i want, im totally pleased.",35.8

"probably my favorite game of all time. while it does away with some of the more traditional rpg elements of previous elder scrolls games, the action based combat system is very well done and offers plenty of customization. honestly, the story isnt all that memorable, but the sheer volume of interesting things to do is staggering. and the mods, oh my, the mods. there are so many available these days that you can create a very unique gaming experience by customizing your game. skyrim should please anybody looking for a detailed and extended fantasy adventure, but may fall short of some long term fans of the series, particularly those partial to morrowinds more stat based approach.",702.6
"best game evar! cant wait for more elder scrolls games.",428.7
"great game. its long, but its hardly boring, theres always something to do, especially if you have the legendary edition. tons of quests, tons of npcs to talk to, tons of places to explore, creatures to slay, landscapes to admire. i enjoyed every single hour spent in skyrim. if you think you wont like it because you didnt like morrowind or oblivion, well, try skyrim anyway, its so different than previous tes games. if you liked gothic, skyrim is for you. if you are a good player, start on master or even legendary difficulty. you can play on the easiest difficulty though, as there are no achievements related to difficulty, so pick whatever works best for you. and one pro-tip- if you are up to get all the achievements, join stormcloaks or imperials before advancing in main story and complete all the missions for them. thats because while theres peace negotiations in high hrothgar (main story), you can make mistake, giving all the keeps to the side you are planning to ally with. this will prevent you from getting conquer fort sungard/greenwall missions, as these forts will be yours already, and the achievement requires you to actually conquer them in battle.",92.4
"f*cking amazing. there are not many rpgs out there like this one. skyrim is a fun first person (mainly) hack and slash game with unlimited discovery and endless fun. it never gets old! if you enjoy this game, you will probably put 50+ - 100+ hours into it. i thoroughly recommend it to anyone. approved *stamps*",70.8

"this is an adventure game in first person. when you enter the game for the first time, you will be amazed by the fantastic land of skyrim. ive spent so many hours on this game, both on playstation, and on pc... but everytime i start playing again, its as if i played it for the first time again. you can complete everything in this game, and still not have seen everything since the game is so filled with opportunities and decitions that can change the game drastically. i highly recommend trying this game out.",568.3
"skyrim is the second game in the oblivion series and quite frankly just doesnt hit the mark. bethasda has completely dropped the oblivion story as and rather than stay true to the oblivion series chose to opt with a futuristic based cyrodil after a war, featuring dragons that are not from oblivion. there is no emporer in this game which i found to be a problem and the blades are fighting dragons instead of oblivion which doesnt make any sense in the story. no one ever meantions. oh it doesnt fit in with the story of the mmo version either. 5/10 but only because its part of the oblivion franchise.",155.0

"i have played this game on pc, ps3, and xbox. this game is one of the best games ever made by bethesda etc. well, that is, at least in my opinion. i suggest, if you are new to the game, do a runthrough with no dlcs of any sort to get your base idea of the game. then buy the dragonborn, hearthfire, and dawnguard addons. after experiencing those addons, if youre up to it, try out some of the workshop mods! some starter mods i suggest are ras (random alternate start), the cco (character creation overhaul {that is if i am thinking of the name correctly}), and the blue bear lodge. overall, this game is amazing and i would recommmend the entire elder scrolls series (except eso, cause i have not tried it....) to anyone who is looking for a old, yet new fantasy, roleplaying based series. so much fun.",191.4

"so much to do! not been a fan of other elder scrolls titles, but love this one.",164.3
"i liked it in general, and its definitely a huge step up from oblivion, but the civil war questline and main story seem underdeveloped, even short. there is no lack of side quests and extra content, but the core seems weak to me.",161.3
"amazing game from an amazing group of game developers, i love rpgs and this was awesome.",12.8
"i dabbled with oblivion. during morrowind i was probably too entrenched in mmos to be playing many single player games. so this was my first real experience with tes. and i have to say that bethesda has created one of the most detailed and interesting worlds ever. i played the game for 121 hours and never finished it. i just enjoyed exploring, doing all of the stories, talking to npcs, etc. in terms of the world, the look, the feel, the music this has got to be the best fantasy rpg ive ever touched. story? combat? mediocre (though again i have not finished the story but plan to fix that now that i got dragonborn). overall i still call this a great game but i can only imagine if bethesda was able to take this world and give me a story that pulled me in as much as games like baldurs gate 2 or mass effect series (well other than the last 10 minutes of me3). still if you have not played the game yet, wait for it to go on sale and grab it. and keep an eye out for eso. heres to hoping we can get a game that feels like tes but can deliver on the promise of enjoyable and meaningful rvr! (im rooting for you xenimax and especially you matt firor!)",121.2
"when i first played skyrim, i played it on the 360. i finished it and thought it was only ok. the graphics were worse than halo 2s and the framerate sucked!! however, upon seeing the entire series for only $20 on amazon, i bought it again. it is significantly more amazing on the pc. so if youre looking to buy is game, get it for pc (retail comes with steam code). xbox can kiss my .",89.0
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazing game. i dont even know where to start. the graphics are beautiful. the overworld is amazing. there is so much content, so much side quests, and so many ways you can shape your character. wanna be an assassin? go ahead. be a criminal. wanna fight for glory? join the companions. no matter what you shape your character to be, it will always be so much fun. there are so many unique things about the game that you just need to check out for yourself. this is definetly one of my personal favorite games, and i would definetly recommend this game for anyone who loves rpgs.",29.3
"this game is addicting. buy it. you wont regret it.",148.5
"i never thought that i would ever say this, but i have found a game (within this genre) that is better than fable ii. the world is huge, there are lots of quests, and there is a huge community of people who play this. the elder scrolls v: skyrim workshop contains almost too many mods, expanding the (already awesome) gameplay even further.",72.7

"skyrim is a triumph in terms of modern rpgs. bethesda has improved on nearly every aspect of oblivion. skyrim will be a benchmark by which future rpgs will be measured. for fans of morrowind: this game has traveled more down the path that oblivion took, and moved farther from the feel of morrowind. skyrim does a tremendous amount of things right, the combat is fun, and the gameplay is beautiful. however, bethesda missed the mark with the voice-acting and how the game world (npcs, etc) handle the player. the characters that you will interact with the most trainers, merchants etc are all voiced by the same small group of voice-actors and sound identical. immersion:shattered. additionally its annoying to be greeted by people as if you were common rabble when you stride into town with a mythical set of armor and weapon.",176.0
"11 stars out of 10. i recommend this game to everyone",91.2
"if exploring is your thing, then youll like this game. create a multitude of different characters and take them out to explore the world. contains many genuinely interesting quests and stories. i highly recommend playing for the story, and not the difficulty as the game itself is very easy (although you may die occassionaly to the unexpected ultra strong guy). combat is very basic, but welcome in a story driven game. if you dont plan on reading the dialogue, then i recommend you stay away. about the only things i didnt like was the leveling system. overall id say it was great, but as an exploration game, i wanted to keep improving my character through lockpicking or armor or whwatever. however you need to focus where you level stuff up much as there is a level cap. fortunately this can be remedied with the abundant amount of player created mods that are fast and easy to install. and if you love the leveling system but dont like the crafting system? there is a mod for that too. 10/10",423.3

"though as a stamd alone, it may come to a point where it can be found a bit repeating, the dlcs and the huge amounts of addons that have been developed offer a unique immersion that few other games offer. definitely worth its monrey.",680.6

"as a fan of the games since before the elder scrolls became a popular series, i highly recommend skyrim. the fifth game in the series has improved immensely over the previous titles in many ways and has even made it easier for newcomers to the series or rpgs in general to enjoy the large, intricate world in which you can do whatever you want, whenever you want, and however you want. so what are you waiting for? there be dragons to slay!!",192.9

"simply amazing. no words can describe the feeling you get as you roam the vast tundra of skyrim as a dragon circles overhead.",124.2
"pretty great, but i had to mod the crap out of it to completely enjoy it. there are lots of 3rd party fixes to most of the bugs, as well as an alternate start mod so you dont have to sit through the tedious opening or the point where you finish going through a cave just to get told to go fetch a rock in another cave. that is what the game consists of without mods. bugs, caves, snow, caves, long waits, caves, rocks, caves, mountains, caves, dragons, and caves. with the steam workshop, you can solve that problem with the very mods that make this game worth it.",144.3
"one of my favorite games, has so much content that you probably will get bored before you can experiance it all.",163.1
"so addictive by the time since ive owned it my play time has clocked in at 200+ hours.",582.6
"probably the best game of all time. you never get bored no matter how many playthroughs you do and if you get bored of the original you can try the dlcs and the amazing mods. they are really well. i cant really rate this game cause 10/10 is to low for it.",83.9
"i love this game, used to play all the other elder scrolls when i was younger on xbox, but then i bought a pc and i realised i needed to rebuy this game. this game is never ending awesomeness if your into rpg and theres hundreds of quests and things to do. if you have a lot of free time i recommend!",41.2
"i find this game repetitive and dull, there are fun aspects in it but i feel that when you have gone into one cave filled with either zombies or bandits, youve been to then all, they are always laid out differently but they all look the same and they all have the same enemies in them so it becomes repetitive. ps: pro tip for fighting a dragon, it doesnt matter how strong you or the dragon is, just stand behind a rock and shoot it and it cant hit you.",51.7
"very nice game. although be warned, too many mods and the game has a seizure",291.7

"this game helped me lose weight. playing for 12 hours straight does that i guess.",78.4
"cant you tell , hooked hooked hooked, beautiful grapics,great character creator,,many mods and support from modders,,,game is incredible. the only regret i have in this game, was the lack of imagenation in many of the storyline mission,,they leave in hanging but if you just want to role play a beautiful character and not so much about how the story ends, ,,i say a must have to own,,,over all, you will enjoy it,,,heck i am nearing 1000 hours ,that should tell you something,,",1174.3
"this is one of the best rpgs i have ever played. in terms of scope, detail, and design i dont think there are many competitiors to skyrim.",59.4
"i wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genre.",143.0
"one of my favourite things to do in games is to explore every nook and cranny of the world, find every bit of loot and lore, see everything. in terms of satisfying that desire, skyrim is like crack cocaine. i cant get enough of it. not to say that im into cocaine  you know what i mean. full review here:",136.2
"in my vast collection of rpgs, skyrim rates as the most polished and engrossing adventure i have played. the replay ability is amazing when you add in the free mods found in the steam workshop. although i play it on a high end pc, i also play it via a vm on my imac and even with the graphics turned down it looks lovely and performs well. well worth the money and a good investment for the long term.",246.4
"this game is rather dull, grey colors, honestly it feels like they are flaunting the fact that it has dragons. the level up systems feels kinda dull and there isnt much to it, making the characters feel very cut and paste, along with not having much filling the world. i would advise anyone get morrowind or oblivion rather than play this.",85.5
"this game is absolutely amazing and everyone should consider buying it.",385.1
"i think this may be my favorite game of all time because of the diversity in the game it may not have very many different classes but the way that you can live and the way that you level up is amazing. also the landscape is just so well done. the only thing that i would change is that you run into multiple people with the same voice. all in all this game is amazing and you should definitly purchase it.",85.4
"honestly, one of the greatest games i have ever played. when the critics first said this was worth over a hundred hours of gameplay, they were not kidding. over 120hrs and im still loving it. theres just so much to do on skyrim its crazy. i approve 15/10.",138.3
"i had a lot of fun with this version of skyrim i think it is loads better than the consle versions pros you have mods now. to me that makes it so much more fun. cons it is confusing how the controls work at first. some mods dont work for the game",27.7
"you can treat this game as a serious immersive rpg and enjoy for hundreds of hours. or you can mod this game and abuse the console commands to turn this game into a sandbox with endless possibilites and enjoy for thousands of hours. the second is only available when you play on pc however. but luckily for you, youre all on steam and you can get it for a measily 5 bucks on sale. to say the game is worth your money is an understatement.",84.3
"too much fun to even describe in words. you can play however, whenever. and if you dont like the path you chose, change it and reap all the benefits of your new powers. flexible, fascinating, brutally glorious skyrim is a brilliant product of bethesda genius",394.5
"skyrim. its an elder scrolls game, which means youre going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game. the combat system, if you want to call it that, is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous elder scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards. however what bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in. dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration. so despite its flaws id strongly recommend this game. there is however a lot of snow. you probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow.",663.9
"pretty good, but get the legendary edition, dlcs are about 45$ . . . .",20.6
"once you see the ending and fool around with the graphics mods a bit theres nothing to do. people who played this game for longer than 50 hours is the same group of people as those who play second life seriously.",95.9
"the elder scrolls series has given us a number of masterpieces over the years. morrowind will always remain etched on my brain whereas oblivion has offered a vast world i found myself immersed into for hours at no end. following up on footsteps of such giants is never easy. and yet the 5th installment of the series, skyrim, still managed to impress and ensnare me.",70.6
"finally, a simulation that reveals the true history of the world, free from the corruption of big government! never trust a library again!",216.9
"break the game after modding in everything from nicer weather to unoffical gameplay dlcs. and naked people, of course. loot everything thats not bolted down, enjoy varied foods ranging from delicious cooked veggie soups to fresh picked giants toes. marry your housekarl. realize after sprawling around in this giant sandbox for 30 hours that you still havent done a thing to progress your main quest.",203.2
"this game gives us an amazing and terrific feeling from the world of skyrim! a huge world with many places intresting places to explore... many choises to evolve your character. graphics gameplay and soundtrack are all very impressive and its one of the best games i have ever played!!! mods will add unlimited value to this game... skyrim is really a pc exclusive game...",28.3

"if you played any of the elder scrolls previews instalments and liked it, you are going to love this game. it improves a lot of the flaws of the previews games, adds a better menu system and has a lot of stuff to do and most quest are really enjoyable.",0.1

"simply the best rpg ever. the scale of the game world is immense and its open world nature allows you to either follow the core story or simply go walkabout and never feel as if you are missing out on anything. as if the vanilla game isnt enough there is a vibrant modding community allowing you to extend the game and provide enough content to keep you coming back for more for a long, long time.",345.5

"this game is a terrible port of the consoles. i cant understand why people love it so much. the controlls are terrible and also you cant roll away in a fight, there is no dodge button nothing. the story is mainstream, you start off as a prisoner and something happens so you will be free. there is no autosave in this game, if you havent saved for 6 hours and you die, well your bad because have fun replaying those 6 hours again. if you play a game would you really like to worry about saving every half an hour? or would you rather just enjoy the game with checkpoints? this game is no fun whatsoever. i cant recommend it to anybody. if you want an adventure play dark souls but not this.",7.1

"even though bethseda has done a lot of degrades to the elder scrolls series, in skyrim, they have made some improvements. one of those being the graphics. i hate discussing this topic but vanilla skyrim is absolutely gorgeous. i also enjoy the crafting of weapons and armor. the moment when you slay the last daedra to get the last daedra heart you need for a dadric helmet to finish off the armor set is priceless,in the sense of acomplishment is amazing. the main quest are fun, and i have put hours into side quest as well. even with these improvements, some dissapointing things in skyrim need to be adressed in my review.one of which being the npc conversations. in morrowind the npcs were engaging and there were many more selections of speech, which added to authenticity of the game. another thing about skyrim that dissapointed me was the quest markers. in morrowind there were no quest markers and your had to adventure and observe your surroundings in order to complete the quest, which is what made morrowind such and outstanding title for me, and made it much more immersive. in conclusion, while bethsheda studios have done many outstanding thing for the elder scrolls series, there is also much more room for improvement. i give the game a 9/10 whoop there it is.",67.4

"theres a learning curve to properly modding skyrim, but once you get it down, this game is ... imho, the greatest pc game of all time. certainly the best rpg. my advice: use mod organizer instead of nexus mm. watch gophers mo tutorials on youtube. mo leaves your skyrim install folder in virgin condition, and makes it easy to switch between mod sets, as well as manage your save games and other features. my must have mod list: * unofficial patches (for skyrim, dawnguard, dragonborn, and hearthfire) * skyui * climates of tamriel * static mesh improvement mod * skyrim hd * enhanced lights and effects (elfx) * audio overhaul for skyrim 2.0 * amazing follower tweaks * convenient horses * immersive weapons * immersive armor * high quality world map (with roads) * xenius character enhancement * ultimate hd fire effects there are many more great ones, but those are my core mods. skyrim legendary is a masterpiece and contains endless hours of immersive content. at $13.59, its one of the greatest values in the history of gaming.",170.2
"one of the best games of all time with intense gameplay and heart pounding moments. i recommened it to eneyone",139.9
"yet another good yet buggy game from bethesda. it looks like a prettied up version of fallout 3, and i like the mideval norse flavor. im still not sure who i want my character to be, though. and i really need a new graphics card to fully appreciate it, i think. based on my limited playtime, id give it a 4/5 stars.",107.0
"you just get lost in the world of skyrim, through beuatiful graphics (on ultra) and intense boss fights as well as a really good story. be a mage, swordsman or archer, or a combination of the 3 and you are in for a wonderfu time. (had it for 8 days, played almost 50hours)",92.7
"i have many more hours on the console. got this game the day it came out and have loved it since that day back in 2011.",22.1
"i had a girfriend before i got skyrim. i left her for a higher power. 10/10 would leave that bi**h again",13.2
"amazing, the legendary edition is the best though.",107.1
"goty 2011 - epic all the way ! inc. one of the best scores and main themes for a game sons of skyrim. do not hesitate... this is one of the few exceptions, where the contet you get, compared to the money you pay, is most definitely in your favor.",338.5
"probably one of the best games i have ever played and will ever play. its just so fun and the story and the gameplay never get boring because there are always things to do and new ways to improve your character and the realism towards the game is cool too",63.2
"very fun and addictive, and including all of the workshop items people keep uploading its an experience that will keep on going. for me this was a fun adventure through the land of skyrim, able to do whatever whenever and for that action to affect many other thing on your journey. the game lagged a bit and crashed a few times but that was probably due to my crappy computer. defenetily a great game to pick up even in years to come.",38.3
"for the small amount that ive played so far its amazing ive never played any of the elder scrolls games but its an awesome game their is so many quests and imense detail :)",135.1
"theres a lot of love for the elder scrolls series, and as someone thats played daggerfall, morrowind, and oblivion, i have to reluctantly say this was my least favorite of the series. the story line does not compell me, nothing in the game really gives me any real reason to care about the overall plot. the dialogue is stiff and feels archiac in the modern age of cinematic gaming. and worst of all, the gameplay hasnt evolved, aside from a pretty skill tree id say its regressed in a lot of significant ways. the combat is the worst part of all, i was so excited to kill a dragon for the first time and it was easily one of the most bitter disappointments i experienced. it doesnt react to your attacks, it just sort of unceremoniously coils over and disintigrates into ash. theres no rewarding feeling in any of the combat, and to me the fact that these titles havent evolved since 2001 indicates to me a philosophical issue where the developers feel theyre unable to make a truly great game. i did put about 40 hours into the game which is generally seen as a paltry amount for any game in the elderscrolls series, but it was enough for me to know it wasnt a rewarding experience.",28.7
"compared to oblivion this is an improvement, but it still has its faults. most of the rpg elements have been dubbed down or removed. the gameplay itself is fine but they have added aspects like regenerating health to make it more appealing to a wider audience. the games modding community, like oblivion is a blast! you can get rid of these casualized aspects with a few mods, also the game looks absolutely beautiful, im excited to see fallout 4 run on this engine! if you want a good time buy this but if you want and es game with more rpg elements, go get marrowind. not saying to avoid this game but if youre looking for something more complex this isnt that appealing, should you buy it if you loved marrowind and/or oblivion? of course! just beware. 9.3/10",121.2
"this game is so much fun. i have played this game so much, its not even funny. i have around 100 hours on the xbox, and you can see how many i have on here. it is a great game for anyone. i highly reccomend playing it. warning highly addictive",39.4
"i cant even play i bought legendary and normal on 2 accounts and yet it doesnt work ive tried everystep on the help page",5.4
"you may think. why do you dislike this game? you have a  of hours invested! well, bad design, but above all, dumbed down design. skyrim world is beatiful, its great to explore and... thats all. the whole story is dumb and you dont have any weight in the world and what happens in it. the combat is pretty much a clickfest, theres also this balancing mechanic that was inherited from oblivion, it was improved but still sucks (you want to fight some bandits with elite gear because of reasons?). the whole dragon thingie, works in the first encounters, then it drags down. its not really emergent or special, just another enemy type that doesnt really have some strategy to it. this whole modern elder scroll makes me sad, we miss you morrowind.",31.4
"the reviews are right, this game is a must have. i wasnt really into morrowind or oblivion but this game is awesome.",54.2
"i do not believe this is a game...its a life experience.",293.6
"i have a dream... that one day i will see the ending of skyrim.",106.5
"look at the metascore..nuff said. get it and stop making excuses.",254.4
"best game ever! this game will give you hundreds of playtime, side-quest and amazing story line. absolutely worth of money but dont forget to buy all dlcs - they are better than basic game :d",29.6
"i initially bought and completed this game for the 360, but like all elder scrolls games this gem truly shines on pc. with the incredible mod community skyrim feels like a whole new experience. 9/10",34.1
"this is an rpg if you like playing medieval games that involes a lot of fantasy this is for you",87.4
"this game is absolutely amazing. spent hours and hours on it.",16.8
"this is probably one of the best games that i have eve rbought, if youre thinking about buying this, dont hesitate. its one of the best!",211.8
"for once in my entire lifetime im going to be serious here. this game is neck-deep in bugs, the voice actors are overused to the point of where i get all too common irreversable headaches. the a.i. is completely ed and the combat system needs to be tweaked. with all the community support with mods this can and has been reversed on many levels, but knowing that bethesda neither had the time nor the funds to make this game the way they wanted, i can indefinitely say with no hesitancy that this game is no doubt the best game of the 2000s. there is no rating that can tell you how amazing this game is.",209.8
"this game is a wonderful game for people who like fantasy, rpg, and open world games. the world of skyrim is so large that its hard not wanting to explore it, and its just amazing how many side quests there are and some of the items you get from the side quests, like doing the daedric artifact quests they are really entertaining and hectic side quests. you can also add some thing into your skyrim world with all the mods here on steam and the nexus mod site. theres no end to the greatness of skyrim. so if you cant decide whether or not to buy this, all i am going to say is buy it now!",32.6
"maybe im an extrange case, but i never get tired of starting a new character again and again, with +300 hours on console i never reached level 40. here is an advice for console users: if you ever get bored of skyrim (exceptional case) get it for pc and explore the broad range of possibilities that mods add to it. once a month i check nexus webpage or steam workshop and add a few mods.",221.9
"this game is truly epic. i have logged 100+ hrs of playing time, and did not get bored once. so much to see and explore and to do...always just one more quest to complete, one more area to see..........superlatives are used too much these days but i would still call this game awesome!!!!",110.8
"at its core, skyrim is a fairly solid game - rather a lot of bugs, to be sure, but still an enjoyable experience. more than six or so voice actors would have been nice, as its rather weird running into, for example, shopkeepers that have the same voice as a quest-lines primary antagonist (though i would like nazeem more if he had alduins voice). where the game really shines, though, is the modding community - most problems that you can think of in the game have been either fixed or bizarrely exaggerated by a mod thats out there, somewhere, and thats without going into the handful of mods that add things with tommy wiseaus voice.",694.3
"i love this game, never bores me; i can constantly come back to it time after time.",209.9
"great game, a lot of fun. can be a bit tedious at times though if youre searching for absolutely every little thing like i am. [i have a tendancy to ignore the main quests to go exploring....kinda makes the game a lot longer than it already is....]",128.2
"absolutely the must play of the elder scrolls series. the increased customizeability and better game play take the series into the next level. a blast to play, and a blast to mod with. recommend for any fan of rpgs",366.9
"one of the biggest games ive ever played. with over 100 hours of gameplay possible, along with the steam workshop mods, skyrim is well worth the price.",30.9
"what a great game: - beautiful graphics; - great story; - good gameplay; - epic soundtrack; if you played any of the past elder scrolls and it did didnt appeal to you i think you will enjoy this game even more! 10/10*",360.8

"what can i say nothing really ..... this game was gifted to me by a good chum the end",1.9
"it is skyrim, be prepared to live vicariously through your person in the game!",183.8
"dont get the game without mods or dlcs!!!!!!!!! dlcs= awesomeness mods= infinite awesomeness!!!!! :d :d best adventure fantasy game second to none and i have played diablo, and the witcher, and dragon age!",10.9
"so much fun, get hearthfire dlc to make your own house and adopt childrew",30.1
"if it wont start on youre pc try removing some addons it helped me",13.0
"i owned this game on the ps3, but it was stolen. i didnt pick it up until the fall sale and i really made a mistake waiting as long as i did. i didnt play the game for at least a year and i was sucked back into the beautiful world that only elder scrolls can do. the map is absolutely gigantic. the combat in the game is great, but doesnt match the difficulty of morrowind. thats okay for me because you do run into some challenges. the quests are great. i find it difficult to follow the main story because there is so much other stuff to do. overall the game is absolutely amazing and would recommend it to anyone!",96.2
"if you dont like this game then you are a complete failure as a human being.",327.1

"a little bit of something for everyone, and theres a lot of somethings to go around. you could spend most of your time just doing side quests and exploring the rather large land that is skyrim. or you could blow right through the main storyline. whats that you say? youve spent countless hours in the wilderness and defeated any and all who crossed you? never fear, brave adventurer - the community has provided plenty of mods to keep you going. everything from new weapons and armor to new questlines, to difficulty tweaks making the game as easy or as challenging as you want. theres a little something here for everyone. now if only theyd add co-op...",203.4

"do you need a recommendation? really? buy it you .",31.3
"prodigious! (i had to look that up.) so much better on pc. faster, better looking and allows mods. easily one of the best games ever made.",29.3
"awesome standalone, but mods can bring it to a whole new level as well. can be tasking to a pc when heavily moded, but worth the trouble. bethesda also delivers the deep story line that they always do.",241.6
"lovely game, however i dont have the time to dig myself into the game. too time consuming.",15.9
"must have for every gamer in the world love the workshop and al the cool mods modders keep up the good work",41.6
"mods, mods, and more mods. i was hesistant to buy at first. it was fun, but i had already played the game. i put in near identical hours on the xbox version, but i wanted to play the game with mods everyone is talking about. stop reading, just buy the game.",82.9
"one of the most entertaining and addictive games out there. thirty bucks is underpriced.",404.5
"awesome new edition to the elder scrolls series. the only things bad i could find about the game is that it is to easy, in the other games like oblivion and morrowind it was a challenge even at lower difficulties in skyrim i had to turn it to master to actually have problems killing the npcs/animals. the other problem is that they took away a lot of the magic system",820.3
"one of my favorites. this game has everything and you can spend well over 200 hours on it without seeing everything. play the main story, side missions, be a thief, assassin, companion (fighter) or a mage. vampire, werewolf, you name it. plus with mods for absolutly everything in the workshop everyone should own this game.",94.5
"this game is by far one of the best games that i have ever played. i have always been a fan of fantasy rpgs, so i knew right away i would love this game. the game by itself is outstanding, but by being moddable, it has surpassed all of my expectations. 100 out of 10 points!",23.6
"having played 90+ hours of skyrim this past week, i figured that i should write a review on it. first of all, i had to said this is an amazing sandbox+ rpg experience. i am someone who enjoyed doing side quests as well as misc quests as a mean to earn more money. i got to say that till now i had not finish the story as there are so much more to do. i was pleasantly surprised initially when i see people with over 2000~4000+ hours of gameplay time. all i can say is skyrim had just that much content especially if you include all the dlcs. i mean just building a single house took me more than 2 hours, not to mention the fact that i had to design and decorate my own house. it pretty much a chore that feel great after you are done with it. i am also barely done exploring skyrim after 90 hours in, the combat are extremely fluid and animated especially when you do a sneak attack. there are many other great elements in skyrim such as pick-locking which can be extremely frustrating but fun to play around with. i had never been this impressed with a rpg before and i definitely think skyrim is by far the best i had played so far for this price. i definitely recommend this game to every rpg lovers, you wont ever regret it especially if you enjoyed other rpg such as the witcher as well as fable.",147.3
"this game cannot be recommended enough. probably one of the best games ever. especially modded version.",182.3
"this is such an amazing game with so many hours of gameplay and a very high replay value. love the economy and crime systems. great game. highly recommend it.",39.3
"this game is the most beautiful open-world game ive seen! the voice actors are great, and the music fits perfectly! highly recommended for anyone whos a fan of rpgs.",0.8
"one of my favorites rpg games. i fall in love with tes, first with oblivion; then i meet morrowind and i just love it more than any other game. and finally i play skyrim in my xbox 360 and have a 100 hours save. but the best part was when i bought it, last summer sales; with all the mods, my own xbox 360 save and a better graphics this is just one of the best games i ever played. thanks bethesda!!! good work",448.6
"i highly recommend this game for people who seek fun and adventures in video games. so many different ways that you can go from the start. gets out my inner dragon.",119.8

"700 hours in - 5 times completed everything - modded to make it prettier than nextgen games.. yep this might be good... brb need my 6th completion! ;)",679.6
"skyrim is the best elder scrolls game so far, with the expansions it has gotten even better. i felt that esiii: morrowind brought more to the table for its time than esiv: oblivion but believe this game has done even more. i have enjoyed it on console, on pc and gone through the dlc which is worth the extra cash. the only thing missing is co-op/multi player but elder scrolls online is running now, although i wish they would have done things a little differently on that game.. even if your not an elder scrolls fan or follower the game is a nice play as it allows you to customize yourself and play in many styles to allow a change up. i did have a few technical issues following the main quest line but just shifted to side quests and other things until i found out how to fix my save. they could have done a litle better on updating to debug some of the common issues or allowed a form of abandoning quests to reset them. overall id say 9.5/10 for what it is as i cant complain about missing features that just werent supposed to be in the game although i think they coulda just put out a co-op patch/expansion to allow us to play with 1 friend or something which would have enhanced the gameplay alot and expanded the games popularity.",19.3

"offers endless hours of fun, whether it be completing the engaging story missions, the countless number of side quests that keep you occupied or just running about killing everything that comes into sight. skyrim includes numerous armours, weapons and items, with the ability to craft many of them yourself. this collection can be ever expanded with the almighty world of modding, one of the best things the elder scrolls series is known for in my opinion.",225.9
"the fifth game of the elder scrolls franchise. skyrim is a unique roleplaying , action and adventure game that you could never compare to any other title. you start out as a prisoner going towards helgen to be executed , but luckily a dragon comes to destroy it and you manage to escape. from there on you make your adventure. you can do anything you find interesting such as doing side quests , the main story quests , exploring the huge lands of skyrim or leveling up your skills. the main story isnt that long , but the side quests will take around 1000 hours to all be completed. the elder scrolls v:skyrim has a high replayability or if you ever get bored from the vanila version , get mods from the skyrim steam workshop or from the skyrim nexus. you wont go wrong by buying this game, even if its published 2011.",103.7

"i have been a big fan for the rpg. countless hours wasted playing the previous game, oblivion. skyrim has been one of the largest, uniquest and funnest games i have ever played. the elder scrolls is truly, without a doubt, the best game series of all time.",95.2
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",248.6

"bethesda does it again in this fantasy action-adventure! the elder scrolls v: skyrim has earned its place as the successor to the elder scrolls iv: oblivion. 200 years have passed since the events of oblivion took place. the high king of skyrim has been slain by the leader of a rebellion and youve found yourself in the same horse-drawn carriage as he, ulfric stormcloak. headed to almost certain death, you arrive in the small town of helgen where the chopping block awaits. filled with skeevers, skeletons, witches and wizards. vampires, werewolves, daedra and even dragons! skyrim is a game that accommodates novice video gamers all the way up to the most experienced. beautiful scenery as well as an abundance of quests will keep you busy for months. that doesnt even include all of the hardwork and dedication the mod creaters over at the skyrim workshop are putting in to bring you even more content! this is definitely one for the collection.",93.0
"best gameof 2011 by fair. the graphics were amazing the voice acting incredible. sooo much stuff to do if your are new to this game",334.5
"a fun and extensive fantasy/adventure game. many people complain that it is too easy, however, they do not understand that the game is less about the hardness than it is about the story and adventure. for a more complex battle system, dark souls may be a better pick, for a more comfortable and sprawling game however and a more relaxed and freedom based atmosphere to go with the adventure, skyrim is for you.",338.5
"within an hour of starting skyrim, id decided this was the pinnacle of the elder scrolls series; 144 hours in, im not so sure anymore. there are diminishing returns in the game as the quests become sparse and your character becomes an unkillable god that can strike enemies down with a single blow. morrowind for all its flaws felt so much larger and more open somehow. maybe im just older or maybe all the locations and journal entries and achievements arent quite the same as being forced to roam a giant world and make your way with no knowledge of what was to come or what was left. regardless, its still one of the greatest games of all-time and i dont think anyone will consider their time wasted after they wander the hills and mountains of skyrim.",354.4
"incredibly fun, good storyline, interesting sub-questlines, and amazing modding experience.",57.9
"for anyone looking for a game to sink a couple of hundred hours into skyrims the game for you. good story. fantastic world to explore. tones of content. one of the better rpgs ive played.",254.8

"the skyrim is a move that you have to pay twenty dollars for down by the docks. i paid fifty for this but it was also pretty good.",55.9
"skyrim is a great game. you dont need me to tell you that though, its metacritic score is through the roof and im sure youve had at least one friend gushing about it. the reason skyrim is great isnt its amazing graphics or fantastic story. skyrim is great because it lets you play. so many games try to force you down linear corridors, and try to tell you who you are. skyrim lets you be who you want to be. want to be a criminal, wandering the wilderness and killing passers by? go for it! want to be a brilliant wizard set on saving the world from dragons? you can do that too. there are limits of course, but the elder scrolls has always done a great job drawing the line. not trying to do too much and making sure the game play is still solid, but catering to as many people as possible. ive been playing the elder scrolls series since the first in the series and theyve all been great, often ahead of their time. skyrim is the best to date, and the pinnacle of the open world game.",82.6
"what can i say about skyrim at this point that hasnt been said already? there are still times, over two years since release, that i find myself wanting to go back and play. i dont discover something new every time, but there are certainly still discoveries to be made.",183.3

"i know many many people will be against my perspective about skyrim... but you made me play 2 hours of really boring  besides fighting a dragon which was cool... but then you made me climb this big  mountain. when i got to the top i found a bunch of monks and they taught me to shout ro! boo haaa. this mixed with the port to pc feel leaves me with little desire to play this game. if you played 300 hours of oblivion their is no rreason to go here. graphics are better but that is about it. however the quality of the game is great, great polish... for me story is everything, im sorry skyrim doesnt quite hit the mark in that department.",24.5

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"skyrim is a fantastic games. things i like: i am a rather busy person and by big issue with some games i play like wow, guildwars(1 & 2), is to play those and get anything out of it i have to set a large chunk of time aside. with skyrim i can hope on, play for 15-30 minutes then go back to whatever else i need to do. dlcs: having exandable game content is a great way to keep a game intesting. availability on steam workshop: having an easy source to add graphic packs and everything else the workshop has really increases the game experience. this also allows people with system that can handle the game itself enjoy the game while allowing others with beefier systems the ability to really make it awesome. things i dont like: <this space intentionally left blank>",573.6

"sorry for my english, but.. not caught in the beginning, but later fascinated very much. this world does not want to leave, do not want to play other games as the atmosphere is wonderful and the world can coexist with other. about fine: after some time - without mods in any way, they are diverse, funny, mysterious and full taste, and all i want to decorate and diversify this world that attracts you more. and how many do not play and you get a lot of fun. of the shortcomings can be identified imperfect pumping system skills, as has circulated quickly certain skill, you can easily kill any enemy of the rat to the dragon, but it is the little things and this is purely my opinion. play, try, skyrim worth the time spent, its a wonderful holiday!)",435.7
"i love the open play of this game. the world is visually pleasing and wonderfully created. its nice to have a main quest with hundreds of side quests. there is so much to do in this game if you love to explore. it is an rpg players paradise. i definitely recommend this game.",304.1

"one of the best games ever. 10/10 would reccommend to anyone who enjoys open world rpgs.",428.6
"a very good open world game with loads of content even without the expansions. if i was being picky it doesnt have the depth of morrowind. this is rectified some what by adding mods that disable fast travel, get rid of location markers with a minimal compass, needing to drink and eat, disabling the main quest until needed and adding alternative starts. this just adds more immersion to this game. the vanilla game isnt rubbish just that modding it really puts it into another level. i can sink quite a few hours into this and whole heartedly recomend it.",196.8

"game was great although, i must admnit to you all that the story from oblivion to skyrim is the exact same..just with different visuals, dragons instead of oblivion portals, alduin instead of mankar camoran, you also meet them both in the respective paradise plane, alot of remade sceens from oblivion, thoh better graphics, but i have to say that the lesser graphics from oblivion, added alot more mystery to the game, the quests were more mystic, it added alot more depth, so i do overall reccomend the elder scrolls iv oblivion, much much more",439.3

"skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played. i highly recommend it for people that like action, adventure based games. it has nice graphics and there is thousands of mods, texturepacks and things like that out there that can make the game special for you. buy this incredibly awesome game, you won`t regret it! i promise!",147.1
"great game, first off i recommend mods as they add new experience to the game. second of all, youll enjoy the new open world the company bethesda has created. for those who have played oblivion, the interfaces is a bit different but as you play you will get use to the changes.",54.0
"funny how if it happens in usa the world changes. when the usa are killing innocent children around the world and destroying houses in afghanistan this thing is pumped by the  media. usa is the true terrorists, they kill every day..  usa all the world nows what you are up to. oinly the people who uses their brain wont allow the media to change your thoughts.  overpumped media , usa has such an arrogant selfish media and society.",46.5
"what an amazing game! for all rpg fans, a must have! you can play it in your own way, no stupid locked classes. immense world and lots of missions (and submissions) to play. great music in landscapes, battles, etc. you got a great map to explore and many adventures. if you want other things you can simply download new-mods in the workshop! ( there are also other mods online, but keep in mind, not everything is trustable! ) or if there arent fun things, you can create it yourself with the creation kit. tes:v is a really fun game! my metascore: 9.2 / 10.0",114.5

"looking for a 10/10 aaa game? then youve come to the right place. even without modding, this game is incredibly good in all aspects, sure, there are of course bugs here and there, unpolished things, unfulfilling rewards from finishing major quest lines, repetetive quests, but these things dont really matter, because youll get hooked any way. add modding, and you have a game with unlimited potential!",1373.0
"its to broken of a game for me to recommend buying it. i understand it is a large game and it would be hard to fix every bug, but come on! ive run into more bugs playing 7 hours on here and 20 on ps3 than ive ran into all other bugs in every other game combined. i wish i could recommend it, but the fact that you have to go into console command more times than you have to save makes the game leave a bad taste in your mouth.",145.4
"this is a great game, definetly recommed this game to anyone. ps buy the legendary version you use less money",213.3
"i did not like oblivion although i played it quite extensively but skyrim is much better that 160 hours passes so quickly, there nearly no boring missions, and the quests blends very nicely in the story! there is a lot possibilities to customize your character as well as choices you can make during the story, thus a lot of way to play the game. when i played the game near its launch i had several issues with quests and had to rely on console commands to unblock my progression on several occasions. the dragons tends to become weak a little to early in the game and that is a little sad for a game revolving mainly on their intention of taking over the world. i really recommend this game to any rpg fan, it is the most complete and richest heroic fantasy rpg i have played so far and it is a ton of fun! ps: and there are now so many addons to tweak the experience !",244.6
"amazing game. if your computer can handle it, the graphics look amazing. i would not recommend playing vanilla, add some mods! spice it up a bit! the gameplay is good, controls are good, has 1 to 1 headtracking. hours and hours of fun. if you are reading this and you have completed every quest in skyrim ever, i congratulate you. if you have just bought skyrim, i encourage you to finish the main questline at your own pace, not right away. anways, the game is great, totally worth the money.",25.5

"ok, first let me say that i generally dont play alot of rpgs and absolutley hate anything involving knights, wizards, magic, castles and dragons. my birthday in november coincided with the games launch and someone gave it to me and it sat on my shelf for a couple of months before i even tried it . (the hype was pissing me off and i just had to see for myself) this is the best open world rpg/sandbox game ever made! (and im considering it for one of my most favorite games of all time) it is simply the most immersive game i have ever played . i had 70 hours in before i even strted the main storyline, which was a clear indicator to me from the start that the game lets you advance in anyway you want and advance your character in any style you choose. has the best levelling system and never felt like a grind at any point.the combat is fluid , the inventory and menu screens were simplistic, the world is huge with a rich totally interactive enviroment, and the graphics were breathtaking",111.7
"300 sunk hours speak for itself. and when you finsished the main game and all its dlcs make sure to check out the awesome mod falskaar, which adds another complete region for free (available on nexus mod manager).",214.9
"skyrim is an open world rpg in the popular elder scrolls series. skyrim does a good job on improving on oblivion by removing the disappointing levelling system and with more handcrafted dungeons and other locations. combat in skyrim is immensely fun and is definitely the best it has ever been in the elder scrolls series, the graphics are also significantly better giving the different races a far unique appearance. mods are incredibly easy to use now thanks to the steam workshop which gives skyrim far more replayability and allows for graphical and gameplay enhancement. unfortunately some areas of the game including magic has been simplified. theres far fewer spells in skyrim than there was in oblivion and morrowind and also fewer weapon types. the ui is also horribly simplified possibly from the consoles but luckily this is easily fixed with mods. overall skyrim is easily one of the greatest rpgs in recent years and a game i would definetely recommend.",310.5
"this game made me shout fus-ro-dah in real life to see if it would work; unfortunately, it didnt. but, i found the game immersive and a lot of fun and i got that going for me which is nice. 11/10",33.4

"this game is a must have for all of you elder scrolls fans out there or just fantasy people. its hours of quests and fun with spells and potions. plus the workshop mods are pretty fun to use  well :3",32.1
"skyrim... skyrim... where shall i begin? overall its a beautiful game, but it feels like it has been dumbed down in ways that i find a little bit depressing. it is a great improvement from oblivion, aesthetically and has more sophisticated mechanics, but the ai seems... really bad. the children also all look the same and have a very annoying voice, towns are underpopulated and many characters are marked essential instead of existing in a true world of choices. however the game is so much effing fun! it is a gorgeous world full of possiblilities and crafting, of sweetrolls and songs and mead. of giants and dragons, and a lot of personality. i give it an 8/ 10. not a perfect game, but a fun and immersive one.",365.1
"late to the party, bf4 has less bugs than this. souless fun, and i enjoy games like this. oh well.",1.3
"amazing game, if you like open world environments then you will love this. the dlc is amazingly well thought out and the adventure never ends.",159.0
"this game has been awarded several goty awards, and for a reason. skyrim is more than full of content, epic dragon slaying action and an entire world for you to engage in a story of your own. also: i used to play oblivion, but then i took an arrow in the knee.",219.4
"i played daggerfall, morrowind, oblivion. this is the best elder scrolls yet. a totally immersive open world experience. arguably the most accomplished game made to date.",8.7
"is in my humble opinion the best open world game to this date. while the main story might not be too exciting, the world, its environment, the sounds, graphics and the granted mod support for skyrim make real life almost obsolete.",195.8
"excellent game, well rounded! i love the elderscrolls series, especially skyrim due to its immersion, expansive open world, lore, and gameplay. ive spent well over 100 hours on it and plan to increase that!",197.1
"even more than three years on i cannot get enough of this amazing game. if elder scrolls online doesnt suck i will play that when it launches too.",331.8
"skyrim is one of those games you could play constantly for weeks, or even months and its still fun. then even after you get bored of it you can return months later, start a new adventure and have just as much fun as last time, if not more. throw mods on top of it, the game just gets even better. the open world exploration is fantastic and there is always something new to discover, its truly an adventure game and i recommend it for anyone who likes fantasy games and open world games.",511.5
"at the beginning, we can deplore the lack of skills that we found in oblivion or morrowind. but quickly, we forget all that, as soon as we wander in this very immersive part of tamriel.",782.6

"the awkward moment when you accidentally steal something and everyone hates you for life.",175.1
"i highly recommend to fans of rpgs and the elder scrolls in particular and even if your not you should still give the game a chance as it is packed with quests and cool features. it does have some issues though such as performance due to the fact the game is poorly optimised and there are many bugs aswell. as always the really good part about a bethesda game is the modding community i highly suggest you take a look at skyrim nexus and check some of the cool stuff people create.",179.0

"incredible game, astonishing immersion and epic storyline. i played this for more than two years and i got to say i still feel like i could do more. if you get bored, there is a ton of mods, which are, in my opinion, the best part of the game. i used to think mods are useless and bad for the game until i tried in this one.",0.3

"as i write this, only 117 hrs on record. one of the most entertaining of the elder scrolls series as far as exploring and finding new things at every turn. i still miss daggerfall (they need to bring back ships, improve spell creation, etc.) and it feels like skyrim has fewer things to loot than oblivion... but with the right mods this game is superb. id say this makes my top 10 list but with a few crippling bugs and with some need for improvement on the crafting/skill/balance area, it will stay toward the bottom of that list for now.",139.8

"very few single-player games can draw me in for many consistant hours in a row, but this game does it very well! there are many different ways you can approach a situation in skyrim and that is one of the many reasons it keeps bringing me back. the lore is made out well and the quests are more thought out than, just go kill this many guys. the atmosphere and the music is spot on and lots of drama to be stumbled upon in the game too. is this game flawless? no.. but with the push of a button, ~ and a few commands, you can fix your problem or even make the game more interesting. spawn in more enemies to fight as one example. or perhaps you want more in this game? stop by the workshop and see what you can find. its so easy to add mods to this game!",140.0

"it is by no means a bad game, but it is quite possibly the most overrated game of all time. i really do not get what the big deal is about it because all it quite literally is, is the actual same engine as fallout 3 just without guns, with spells, and medievil enemies and two different colors of graphics: black and gray. and a few dragons. the combat needs no explanation because it is the exact same melee combat as fallout 3. entertained me for about 15 hours and that is it. and for future reference bethesda, try making your fallout games and their spinoffs so that we dont spend about 75% of our time looking down to search around for coins and potions and stuff. and not every single thing in the game needs to be able to be picked up. nobody cares about picking up the ten thousand bowls and books and toenail clippings lying around, especially since most all objects serve no purpose and the game can be played through without picking up 99% of the stuff lying around all over. and please stop using the fallout 3 engine. it is old as dirt and it gets boring fast. still fun games, just need a totally new rebuilt engine for fallout 4.",6.0

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"the fifth installment of the elder scroll series is honestly one of the best games i played. first off, if you are fan of - rpgs medievel action magic/spells awesome mods/mods of almost anything get this game. if i were to give a brief description of the game itself, i would say this. skyrim was the first elder scrolls game i played, and before then, i had no idea what the elder scrolls was and i didnt care. however, when i saw the gameplay of this game, and trailers of it, i was surprised of why didnt i try oblivion or the older games, as skyrim looked so beautiful and awesome. skyrim is a medievel rpg taken to whole level that makes the game feel alive, colourful and wonderful. its one of those games where you could just get lost within the world of quests and gameplay and scenery. it has a unique touch and flavour that makes this game enjoyable still to this day and will still be for a long time. i would go further into detail of the game, but once i go further into detail, this review will be so long, plus skyrim is a game that cant be described entirley with words of its awesomness, you just need to play it to understand how great of a game it is. 9.5/10",67.8

"having spent many hours (days, weeks :-) playing skyrim, i finally feel qualified to report that it is without doubt one of the best games available on steam. the vanilla game is very good but where this addition excels is in the mods and the modding community attached to it. with over 8,000 mods, you can play as anyone from an immortal god sent to save the planet, to a serial  and murderer intent on destroying it (i have been both). and anyone or anything you can think of in between! be warned though, this one will consume you and your time. having cut me teeth on tes iv oblivion, i had high hopes for this sequal and it did not disappoint. if you consider yourself a true gamer or have ever wondered what it would be like to really live another life (within or outside the law), skyrim is a must have!",463.8

"what is there to say, other than that this is one of the greatest games of this genre and potentially the best game of the year? learning from the formulas of their previous elder scrolls games (as well as from fallout 3), bethesda has put together the pinnacle of the open world exploration/fantasy game. whether you desire to do battle with dragons, conquor lands in the name of an empire, seek out treasure in ruins or just simple wanderlust, the overwhelming amount of options available to you in terms of how to play and what there is to do and see is staggering. absolutely phenomenal. everyone has to play this game.",205.1

"elder scrolls always provides the ultimate rpg experience in terms of replayability and skyrim is no exception. it also provides one of the freest game environments, you can do pretty much whatever you want, and the full game experience is not defined by completion of the story. very strong modding tools and a very strong modding community that creates the best user made content of any game.",434.4

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"skyrim one of the best elder scrolls games if not the best game in the series. skyrim is an outstanding game with immersive visuals and atmosphere. the music that plays during night and day and even the music when exploring dungeons and nordic ruins really sets the atmosphere. skyrims graphics are amazing especially with the free high resolution texture pack installed. now enough of that lets get on to the story. skyrims story is amazing and is very immersive. it goes from slaying dragons, to fighting the undead nords of skyrim known as draugr. bethesda has put an amazing back story for almost every quests and creature in the game. skyrim will have its amazing storyline to the occasional side quest such as visiting the college of winterhold and joining the imperial legion. one of my favourite side quests (and im sure most players will agree with me) is the companions. but in the end it has an amazing twist. but thats something youll have to find out yourself. overall skyrim is one of the most amazing video games i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing 10/10-silver reviews",218.2

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of those games that ultimately grants you the freedom to do the things that you can only do in your imaginative mind. for example, you can kill people in bars, villages, castles, stands, anytime you want, however you want. killing by doing a finishing touch is my favorite part of the game. you can have a pet, wife, build a house and do a lot of varied things. though what makes this game better is the mods, you can do tons of things with it and do a lot of hilarious crap, stunts, sex, movie scenes and other crazy stuff. this game just never ends and theres always things to do even if you dont want to do quests. dragons, monsters, spirits, horses, women, potatoes, and stealing things craftily are all huge features in the game. now, finally, dont be like me who waited to buy this game on sale and not pay the full price of it. because it is definitely worth your money!",67.0
"what can really be said about this game that hasnt been echoed by everyone who has played this game and liked it. the graphics are vibrant and detailed. the world is massive and filled with personality (well, when youre on quests that involve those characters anyways). the gameplay is tight and vastly improved from the clunky mess that was oblivions combat system. the mods add hours among hours of gameplay to the already expansive experience. all in all, the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazing game that will devour your life and lead to hours and hours of fun, so id recommend this title highly, with eveything given to you and how much this game will last, its well worth the price. not even mentioning the dlc, which extends the amount of fun content with vampire lords, a more extensive houselife, and a return to an island off the coast of morrowind. buy it, assuming you havent already!",174.6

"i had not played pokemon games before--i was under the wrong impression that they were just for children and then there was a lot of media attention on fire red and leaf green--i was going on a long trip so i got fire red. it takes a lot of memorization skills to play pokemon games well so adults can enjoy these games, in my opinion. for those who havent played before, pokemon are actually very intricate and there are different types of pokemon so you have to remember their abilities and what types can easily beat other types and you switch pokemon in battle depending on their strengths and abilities. of course the graphics on this game are very, very good. what i liked best was the ability to get ingame help and for some reason it just really tickles me to see the little hand pick up my pokemon and move them to or from the storage boxes. i also like the fact that when i turn the game on it rehashes the last few things i did before stopping gameplay last time. this is really good for me because i dont get to play everyday and if too much time goes by, i do forget my last moves. i also have pokemon crystal for gbc and, i think it is a little easier...so if youd like to try pokemon, maybe that is a better game to learn first...both have been very fun and entertaining for this adult gamer. gotta catch em all...",7.7

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",248.6

"as a long-time elder scrolls fan, i was very skeptical of skyrim at first. in fact, i didnt play it for 3 months after its release. oblivion was dumbed-down for consoles, and the pc version suffered for it. skyrim, on the other hand, is somewhere between morrowind and oblivion, despite still showing obvious signs of being a console port. its got a lot of content - you can spend hours just exploring, and that alone is great fun. the addition of dragons and shouts to the game is great, and taking a dragon down can be very satisfying. the main storyline is decent, and the various factions are fun as well, but thats not what youre here for. youre here to explore, discover, fight your way through hundreds of bandits and creatures, cave dive, dungeon crawl... all of it is endlessly entertaining. one last note - the modding community is very active, and that alone will keep me playing skyrim for a long time. if you get this game and dont mod it, youre missing out.",331.0

"fantastic game. theres so much stuff packed into it that youll still be stumbling into new stuff to do 200+ hours into your first playthrough. countless mods and community-made expansion packs make the game just that much better. theres even a massive unofficial patch for many of the more irritating bugs. skyrim is definitely one of those games that truly shines on the pc over any other platform because of its sheer versatility.",240.3

"skyrim is an amazing game, filled with all sorts of adventures and exploration, made by bethesda, who also made the 2006 and 2008 games of the year. the game has an absurd amount of things to do, and there are few games that encourage you to explore and participate in the world as much as this one does. many people can get their moneys worth out of this game, but its particularly tailored to those that like rpg and open world games. additionally, this game can have a large amount of bugs. even with this drawback, id recommend this game to anybody - particularly if its on sale.",327.6

"i just finished my first play-through of the game with no mods. i am a fan of the series and this one delivers. the game is very open-ended and you get what you put into it so your experiences will vary. i will compare my experience between oblivion and skyrim: gameplay- combat has been improved and leveling feels more natural. terrain feels impassible at times. the map is huge! visuals- although the visuals have improved, i think oblivion had more revolutionary graphics for its time. i also feel that oblivion with its forests was a more beautiful game and skyrim seems a bit too bleak and barren and lacks color and details sometimes. (you can probably fix this with mods) interface- has changed and it took some time to get used to the quickslots. the menus are clearly designed with a controller in mind, but it is quick and efficient to use once you get the hang of it. plot- i dont want to spoil any of the plot, but i will say that i liked the factions and how they tied to the lore. very solid plot. dragons?- yes there are dragons! yes they do get boring very quickly. overall- one of the most entertaining and replayable games you can get on the pc. i look forward to modding it and replaying the game with a different character.",133.0

"when i first entered the world of skyrim, i was immersed in a fantasy setting where i was quickly thrust into a position of power and entrusted with the responsibility to save the world. this is where the fantasy stops. similarly to any human suddenly gifted with immesurable power i proceeded disregard the responsibilities of my newfound abilities and proceeded to instead enact horrible deeds on the citys guards and townsfolk. it begins to become painfully clear that skyrim is not as much of a fantasy game as it is a digital exression of the depravity of humans when given the means to enact their deep and twisted desires. an excellent existential simulator questioning the depth of vileness to which a human soul can delve into, skyrim poses many deep philosophical points such as tyrrany, racism and the uselessness of having a %based pickpocket system if you have quicksave and quickload and reaching the ultimate conclusion of f*ck it, if you kill dragons you must be right.",147.5
"this game is terrible. the woodcutting has no depth. you simply need an axe, and a pile of wood. and the wood is really obvious too. i thought this was an exploration game. but its not. the wood is lazily placed wherever, with no need to actually search. and theres only one kind of axe too. like what were they thinking? once you get an axe, its just reppetitive wood cutting. almost zero replay value. and no role playing aspect either. your woodcutting has no effect on the game world. i mean you might as well just listen to bon jovi. the main story is pretty weak too. its just cut this wood and cut that wood. and there is a complete lack of variety in the different wood you can chop. you would think that in a rich fantasy world such as tamriel there would be all sorts of enchanted wood. but you would be wrong. in conclusion: lazy developers, non existent writng and wood development, and no replay value. better off buying woodcutter simulator: 2014. huge dissapointment. maybe elder scrolls online will right these wrongs, but im not holding my breath.",402.6
"when taken in total, it must be admitted that the elder scrolls v: skyrim does not deviate much from the established elder scrolls formula. however, the painstakingly-designed world in combination with the retooled leveling system represents the most polished version of that formula to date. theres something to be said for sticking with what one knows and refining it, and in skyrims case, theres a lot to be said for it. - gamecritics not much of a skyrim fan, but played some time on this game with mods which makes everything better 91/100",27.3
"i would not recommend this game to others for a few reasons. mostly because as an open world game i didnt find it nearly as engaging as people make it out to be. also the professions are pretty overpowered? i guess would be the word. since ive only played through the game once i was just running around doing quests and they took some time. however, once i decided to level blacksmithing specifically the game became terribly easy and i ended up one shotting the final boss. however, on a positive note, i will say that if you enjoy modding etc. the number of options to change your gameplay for this game are almost unimaginable. i am basing this review simply off unmoded play.",102.5
"the elder scrolls universe is the most richest, filled and complete thing. it would take 4 hours to give a minimum explanation and days to give a full explanation. the music is very relaxing and makes you feel like a true nord. <-- had to sneak it in, sorry. every elder scrolls installment has had music to grip you in, and leave you amazed. every flaws this game has, can be forgiven by itself. that is litteraly something you would never see in a game. if you were to inspect every little detail of this game, (probably would take a year) you would be guaranteed to miss some things, so much openworldiness. 10/10 replayability, you can replay this game over and over and over as a different race, each discovering things you will never forget on each character, making you super op. that is why this open-world playground can achieve, and every single npc has a humongous backstory, if you are willing to look into it. a little tiny quest can have so much backstory, leaving you jawdropping on how much lore it has. this game made it to my top 10 games list, at #2, almost beating just cause 2. buy now, or regret doing so because you would miss out on a giant journey, that would make you rethink your life choices. (kind of.)",428.8
"i admire this games diversity and its ability to offer more experiences thru its modding community. i would recommend it to anyone, what it has to offer is so good and so unique it sets a standard that im sorry to say nowadays is quite rare.",50.7
"i think that skyrim is a a game with a lot of potential, but sadly all of that potential is in the hands of the modders as the developers seemed to lack any desire to properly port this game to the pc. the game itself is bland on almost all levels. melee combat turns to smashing the mouse button as fast as you can, the story is drawn out for how little content it really has, and the overall game feels like a poor port. shadow bugs, lod bugs, quest scripts breaking, and numerous objects/textures which look really bad without the help of mods. mods can fix a good amount of the games issues, but many of them will be impossible to fix without complete engine overhauls. on top of all of this, much of the landscape, architecture, and caves are recycled, which just adds to the blandness of the game. i would recommend this game only to people with the intent of intense modding.",366.5

"skyrim is so much better on pc because of all the random mods you can add to make the game more funny and more interactive.",25.8
"ok, i have played this game through multiple times, and i have played more hours than steam shows because at first i was only playing it on the xbox 360. then i realized how much better the pc version of the game was! so since that realization i have been exploring the land of skyrim on pc only. now, on the pc you get access to extras like high resolution textures and many many mods. modding makes the game almost endless. so if you want a great looking game that is also a great playing game then i recommend skyrim. there is so much to do & different ways to do it each time, and its one of the games i return to when i get bored with the other 120+ games on my account.",385.6

"i deffinately recommend this game if youre a fan of fantasy rpg games. there are so many options and possibilities as you level up and progress the game, that you will deffinately have a unique experience and character. and thats one of the things i really like about this game. the character that you create is yours and only, because you have the option to choose whichever perk you like in order to make a unique and different person in the world of skyrim. plus, there are so many quests to do, and every single one is different. some are easy, some are hard. some are serious and some are quite funny in my opinion. :) deffinately one of my favorite games. (p.s. the graphics are amazing)",171.4
"since i bought and played the game, i realised that this is my favourite role play game (short rpg). ive always liked rpgs like the warcraft series, and played the mmo. but skyrim has elements that i didnt find in world of warcraft: the feeling of importance of your character in-game. that is a rpg, and thats a rpg i love to play. by the way. i recommend skyrim for all fantasy / medival / rpg fans that plans on buying the game or are just reading this message. thats what i have to say, and thank you betesda. ill play the prequels someday.",784.0

"all the way around, a fantastic game. im not usually the gaming type, but skyrim sucked me in like nothing else. i think the main reason for this is its massive map and the enormous number of possible quests. all things considered, it makes sense why it just recently became the 20th most popular video game in history. if you want something to play for hours and hours, and enjoy prgs, this is definitely the game for you!",258.2

"this game suprisingly really cool! it really give me the feels that i really dive in in the world of skyrim,thanks to the open world system. the open world system for me is too open because i can steal someone belonging in the city and then they call me a thief,or just shout in the face of the jarl and suddenly i became their enemy,or just hurting the buffalos farmer,they will brand me with a bad title,but thats a great point of this game,open world. the story and mission is soo many,so for you who like exploration so much,i really recomended this game for you. ive been playing for 20 hours and still at level 13. all i did in that 20 hours is doing exploration,hunting down the dragons,and searching the power of shout the atmosphere really cool,but the music i think is too repetitive. overalll i recomended this game for player who likes rpg,adventure and action",30.4

"ive never got past the first main story mission because i got distracted by all the other awesome stuff this game has got to offer. do yourself a huge favor and buy this game.",124.4
"this game is a great rpg set in the a different world in the nordic era. you start by creating a character of any race who, spoiler is dragonborn (a man/kat/lizard with dragon blood) who, as the old tales have foretold, has come to kill the world eater alduin and bring peace to the world, or at least all of skyrim. all while you are on your quest to kill the beast you will be tossed into a civil/religious war where you must choose a side, the stormcloaks, the rebels who are fighting for the right to worship talos, a god whos worship was banned by the imperials after the aldmeri diminion invaded, or the imperials themselves where your goal is to quell the rebellion activley brewing in the different holds. that just covers the base game, if you buy the dlc it gets even better. 10/10 must buy!",96.5
"skyrim. remember the name -- for its the name of a game that captured something that few ever have; and few ever will. its personality, cultural status; popularity among the casual to the elite -- its a game that no review can do justice. i have played this game for many years; purchased when it first released; and ive never put it down longer than a few weeks at a time -- you can get lost into the game as a vanilla standalone or reinvite it an infinite amount of play throughs with mods. over 200 hours in this game; and ive never made it beyond the half way point of the main story arch -- that is how easy one can get lost in this game -- as immersion goes; no game can touch this; and perhaps (with the pending doom of eso) -- this may be the last elder scroll title to even attempt this sort of play style -- if you are reading this review; to help you decide wether or not to purchase this game -- then you have failed yourself; you have failed humanity -- why did you wait so long to be apart of this wonderous world? if you are robbed yourself of so many hours of magic; dont rob yourself of a minute more by reading this review; go buy the damn thing already!",307.9

"overall thoughts - the legendary edition is a great deal. it is unfortunate that the game doesnt live up to what is was hyped to be. for some reason i was never able to really get into the game as others have been able to. i have played many games in this genre, but this one is particularly boring. the world is beautiful at first, but it gets very dull after about 30 minutes. the mod support for the game is great. there are alot of different mods for you to choose from if you are interested in that sort of thing. the combat is fun, but you do more running around than actual fighting. gameplay 4/10 - nothing special here. the combat is generally boring. the dragon fights are fun but far between. environment/graphics 4/10 - awe inspiring environment at first, but you will soon be fighting to stay awake in this dull, bleak, dreary environment. story 7/10 - the story is decent, all i can say really. length 8/10 - vanalia skyrim has a lot of content for you to explore. however, you might find some parts of the game repetitive and lacking creativity. mods give the game replay value which is the best aspect of this game. overall 6.5/10 - get the legendary edition because it will come with all of the dlc which will add more replay value. if you are looking for a game with a large amount of content and replay value, then this is the game for you.",16.7
"skyrim. years later and many charaters later, i still play this great game. sure the story is boring, and the two primary quest structures are terrible. sure the dialouge isnt very good. sure there were numorus glitches. its still a great, open-world game. i still throughly enjoy clearing out dungeons, killing monsters, stealing money, helping the common folk, bare knuckle brawling in pubs, and the tons of other activities this game has to offer. every new character is an adventure, and many times ill find something new about the game, even after so many years. i highly recommend this game. this is a truely great game.",2.3
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a great game, and even with the mighty console commands available, the game takes a long time to thoroughly beat. i cant even begin to get into the fact you can mod the game to extend the fun even further, because frankly that would just give me far too much to talk about. even with all i just said though, i believe there is currently a problem with skyrim on steam, because when i tried to play it on a different computer, it didnt show up in my games list like it always has in the past, and then my friend purchased the game, the money was taken from his bank account, yet no purchase verification from steam was sent to his e-mail, and the game never showed up in his library. an hour since the initial purchase and still not even a verification e-mail actually. i would simply recommend doing a little research to see how many people are having issues with skyrim (or perhaps even steam purchase problems in general at the time i am typing this) before making the purchase.",56.0

"i really love this game. its got a great story line with tons of things to do that never gets old or boring. the extra dlc helps with giving you more options of things to do, giving you a whole different side of things here. i was a little disappointed with the amount of quests available in the dlc. it doesnt seem like they have a lot, you kind of buzz through them fast. but there is a lot of exploration, lots of things to kill, great story line to them, and exciting. i just wish there was a lot more quests to participate in.",36.3

"skyrim is known as one of the best games since it has won over 200 awards. not a lot of people remember the original elder scrolls but they dont remember/know how good the original elder scrolls are. this comes to skyrim, a very long game. if you buy the offical prime guide there is 1134 pages, no joke its real. you play as a prisioner that by luck escape from a dragon who destryoed the town ur in. the game is like a medival time scenery. you can literally do watever you want, even kill someone for no reason but youdo get a bounty from the nearest city which is not very fun considering if theres 5 guards fighting you. since this game is extremelly long, only like 2% from all systems actually beat this game 100% and they may have around 2,000 to 6,000 hours, yes its that dam long. so hope you enjoy this game and remember, pickpocket,kill,and rob everyone (just kidding, dont do it unless you want skill points)",318.1

"its technically a never ending game. there are a pool of races that you can choose to be for the game as well as hundreds of thounsand of mods that you can play with. travel distance from one town to another might be far, but there are definitely some caves or fort to be discovered. however, if you dislike to play it steps by steps, there are numerous command that can level you up instantly, tons of gold, instant quest complete which is highly not recommended. nevertheless, the main quest and side quest can barely to be finish in a short period of time. this game does consume a hell lot of time, but it will stay on for years and you wont get bored with it.",201.2

"after umming and arhhing about a thumbs up or a thumbs down, honesty got the better of me. yes, the graphics are a delight, but the gameplay is a sticky mud pie, the combat awkward and unresponsive to input controls, there are way too many mini-quests where you have to go out and slay beast or animal and then report back, wasting so much game time on irrelevancies, and the game totally failed on the replay stakes. ive been trying to go through it again, having learnt from the mishaps of the first run, but it is not holding my interest -- quite the opposite. if you just want to roam an endless landscape in awe of the graphic artists, then this is ideal. if you want a play a game at the same time, leave it alone.",77.3
"skyrim is a masterpiece - period. its also long and im not exaggerating. the numerous amount of side quests can have you exploring forever and a day, as its meant to. the game is designed to be enjoyed, not to be rushed through. you are meant to go explore in this vast world, interact with the numerous characters that you encounter, be fulfilled in combat and feel like the dragonborn you are meant to become. the main storyline is fantastic and is well worth the journey. all the other stories along the way are just magical... a never-ending fable that urges you to keep going. everything in skyrim is just stunning. i seriously have so many screenshots of so many amazing views. i feel like a part of me plays just for the game photography and that isnt an exaggeration in the slightest. the music composed by jeremy soule is just an epic masterpiece.",326.3

"i punch a chicken, them everyone want kill me. 10/10",204.4
"i dont actually own this game but i apparently have 34 minutes in it. its good i guess?",0.6
"summery in a few words - the best elder scrolls to date. even those who loved morrowind and liked oblivion will love this one. though some pc specific ui would have been nice. like implementation of hotkeys. still the sheer number of content will surprise you....... guarantee",76.0
"game becomes very boring to quickly.. everything you do feels half-farted & lacks any real purpose.",7.8
"pretty good. the cookie-cutter world (nearly every building and dungeon enterior is the same) and lame anti-climactic ending hurt it alot. but exploration and combat are fun and interesting.",6.8
"a great game its open world and well i could go on for ages because its a awesome game",111.0
"ive played dagger falls, morrowind, oblivion and now skyrim. each one is better than the one before. there are some outstanding mods for skyrim that keep me playing. a great fps rpg!!!",186.6
"hey doushbags, how about making this game for mac?!! ive wanted this game for a long time, and have no console to platform to buy it on, and im stuck with a mac and dont have enough money to buy a windows!!!!!!",0.8
"this is a great open world style rpg, that is very immersive. in this game you fight dragons, barbarians, vampires, witches and so much more, all within the first 10 hours. this game is here to impress, with a great combat system and choices that actually mean something, e.g. do you join the stormcloaks or the imperials?, this is a tough choice as either can change the game quite a bit. another great thing is that you can do things at your leasure, so if you get bored doing the main sort of story, you can start a sidequest or two like the thieves guild or the dark brotherhood quests, which are a very fulfilling part of the game. no matter what there is always something to do, with dungeons refreshing every few days, and if you start playing with all of the dlc, well you have a heck of an adventure waiting for you. if you want my opinion of a score out of 10, i would give it a pretty much perfect 9.5/10.",114.1
"amazing graphics, made me fall back in love with playing on my pc",43.7
"a must for everyone pretty much. extremely unique environments with every minute feeling fresh and new. get it as soon as possible - no hesitation whatsoever!",104.8
"i simply love this game. i bought it about two years back on my birthday for my xbox for 10 dollars at gamestop. this was the first rpg type game i ever played and enjoyed it immensly. but, just a few monthes ago i started to switch over to the p.c. to give it a chance. the first gamei bought was this and when i found out about console commands (just use them for fun) i figured out this game has it all. great story, combat, and the graphics are absotuley stunning. and the fact that i could get mods to addon to the already massive world i just got happy. overall i reccomend this to anyone that loves a strong rpg and loves tes series.",164.3
"what part of elder scrolls dont you get? if you dont own this game - youre doing it wrong.",225.0
"this is one freaking awesome game. fill the sky with dragon blood. burn or stab mother$%#@s who get in your way. get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",240.4
"alongside with dragon age:origins definitely the best games for me.if i had to choose one game to keep on my pc and delete everything else,skyrim is my choice,no doubt!",20.1
"i recommend the game but i dont recommend steam, as i tried to get the lock pick pro mod and then i had to subscribe to the creator then had to make a thing to have as to get the mod, and i still cant seem to get it,,wtf, i dont need the trauma of trying to do what steam wants me to do for something that should be simple !",271.6
"its good! ive put on many more hours on this than it looks (playing offline mode) so many mods make this replayable many many times over.",192.8
"just the greatest rpg ever created. i recommend picking up dragonborn and hearthfire dlc. dawnguard is good too but only buy when it is on sale. also peruse the mods. there are some real gems in there.",7.4
"this game is crack. it will consume your life. you will spend hundreds of hours playing this game and still be coming back for more. easily one of the best, if not the best, game ever made. but buyer beware: your social life will disappear once you start playing this game.",24.9
"220hours in and i still havent completed the story plot; too busy stealing, vampire slaying, crafting badass armour and watching the borealis from the ramparts of the blue palace.",220.9
"definitely one if not the best game i have ever played. the elder scrolls v: skyrim, or as it is called in short, skyrim, offers a vast land full of opportunity, bandits, mages, warriors, and a civil war for you to pick a side and end. the world is so full of activities it is almost impossible to name them all. the story is great, the side-quests are not only individual, they are sometimes in some sort of lineup of those that are similar. even if you do run out of quests, which would take you more or less 100 hours, you can just make up your own, such as kill every giant in the game, raid a city, try to get as much bounty as you can in one place, the possibilities are very well near endless. skyrim devours your time, but its plenty worth it. i definitely recommend this game.",80.9
"amazing game, lots to do, if you have never played this game then you have never lived.",96.5
"prepare to experience your new obsession. -bethesda, on daggerfall, 1996. nearly twenty years of development and gaming granduer have brought us to this point. since we first saw arena in the early 90s much has changed, but one thing has remained constant... you dont play an elder scrolls game, you experience it.",226.8
"this game is absolutly astonishing; the graphic quality is amazing; the storyline is malleable, because you can do the storyline whenever you want, so that you arent 100% required to do the campaigns; and the complete objective of the game is incredible. i strongly only reccomend this game if you have a good computer and if you are able to wait about 6-8 hours for this to download, but ill tell ya, its totally worth it.",11.3
"if you do not own this game. what the hell is wrong with you",457.5
"i played skyrim and the giant hit me and my character ragdolled into the stratosphere, i knew it was the work of mehrunes dagon because that wasnt how physics worked. he was like satan only not and then i saw demons in the game saying they wanted to take my heart and i knew this game was haunted because ghosts and skeletons were in a dungeon.",173.2
"this game is way too addicting, but that is mainly because it is just so amazing with the way that it allows for fantasy style gameplay integrated with thousands of mods. if youre a fan of immersive rpgs, modable first-person environments, and/or amazing scenery (especially with texture mods), this is the game for you. gameplay can be adapted for people who like anything from simple slash-and-bash games to more elaborate role playing, and therefore, as long as you dont have some unexplainable need for guns, this game can bend to your every whim. it does take time to get used to though, as this is nothing like tetris.",249.9
"really good game. better than oblivion. worked and improved a lot of aspects. huge time sink if you keep looking for things to do. it is truly your adventure.",490.7
"god, yes. although combat gets a bit stale after sinking in over 500 hours (dont judge me), the world is so massive and detailed itll keep you entertained for months. recommended!!!",307.5
"walked into cave, got mauled by a bear. 10/10 would play again. ps: my old account has over 4000 hours on this game. mod it and have the best time of your life.",57.7
"skyrim is an amazing game with a lot of replayablility. the vast amount of styles that you can play keeps you entertained for hundreds of hours, especially with mods. skyrim does have some bits that may annoy you from time to time but nothing groundbreaking. this game is truly a masterpiece and should be experienced by everyone.",347.4
"so i think this is an amazing game, but it depends on what kind of gamer you are if youre 1st person shooter this isnt for but if you are an rpg gamer ( role playing game ) this is for you but im a big sience fiction fan so i love this so its up to you but just look up review videos if you are not sure but i say it a great game !!!!",55.2
"favorite rpg and one of my favorite games of all-time. leveling is fun, good story, combat is ok, and mod support!",54.7
"fun rpg. have spent a lot of time playing. even if the story isnt the most engaging ive ever played, the world itself is extremely broad. as its a bethesda game, there are always a few bugs lurking about, but the various mods around the area should be able to fix that easily. would definately reccomend.",189.1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"great great game, constantly coming back to it. even better with the mod support, which adds more playabilty to a game that already seems close to infinately playable. ive played morrowind, ive played oblivion. but skyrim really grabbed me.",281.0
"the elder scrolls is one of my favorite rpg series and skyrim is no disappointment. an open ended world, great voice acting, deep character customization, solid gameplay mechanics and the freedom to pursue the kind of character you want to play make this a choice game for any fans of action rpgs and there has always been a great community surrounding the series with talented modders who take the game to a completely different level, creating a deeply replayable experience.",747.1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim. is alot of fun plain and simpel, for anyone who loves to get lost in a world where you can walk for an hour without finding your self at the same place 2. it is a game where playing for a 100 hour is short. it had alot of bugs in the beginning but i only had a few over the now 300 + hours i have spent in this game, and with all the updates most of the bugs are gone. and for anyone who thinks this game dose not look good, there are alot of mods that make it look beter. this game is one of the best rpg out there a 9 out of 10 game.",388.7
"i was made into a midget and was impaled by a spear thrown by other midgets that were blue. 10/10",131.9
"what is there to say about skyrim that hasnt already been said? even after the game has been around for a number of years, thanks in part to an amaziong community this game continues to flourish. far from perfect due to wooden and oft repeated voice acting, the exploration and fabulous feel of living in the world are more than enough. if you havnt tried the game, grab it in a sale, and set aside 100s of hours of your life. oh, and make sure you grab the hd textures =)",91.3

"skyrim is the game that keeps on giving. it already boasts a great amount of content right out of the box, and its dlc offerings are fairly robust as well. the truly great thing about skyrim; and just about all other bethesda games, is the modding scene. this game receives mod updates constantly; and while quite a few are middling in their quality there are about as many that are awesome in comparison. skyrim is a huge game and experience and can be dangerously addictive. be careful not to let it swallow up your free time; its been known to be that way for me from time to time.",361.8
"easily one of the top games of 2011, if not the number for sinleplayer anyways. they added some great new features to the franchize. like dual wielding spells and weapons or spell and weapon. i have yet to finish the whole main story even with hundreds of hours played. yet with what i have completed it is a great story probably the best or second story wise. oh and then the mods, thats what really makes this game worth every penny. you can make this game from 2011 look as if it isnt coming out til 2014. i doubt even the new consoles could run my modded copy with its 250+(need speacial mod to have over 250) @ its tremendous 80 80gbs. no matter what people say all the dlc is a must have besides heartfire.(can get pretty much the same with mods) just do yourself a favor and get the legendary edition. anyone who misses this title missed the best game experience money can buy. 11 out of 10 lol. p.s. only thing i wish is they stuck with the old spell crafting system from oblivion or even better yet morrowind.",590.7
"a fun game were you can change the path as you want more or less",98.1
"very good sandbox+rpg. if you like to grind, collect loot, sell your loot, do quests, kill bandits, hunt animals, make weapons, make potions, pry into the lives of npcs, ride a horse, kill dragons, etc... this game is probably for you. bad points about this game? well... it evolves very slow, you will be facing for a long time same kind of enemies, wearing the same armor until new one is unlocked and you will discover that really there is not point to work in some areas/specializations if your are not totally focused on them (so think very carefull at start the kind of character that you wan to build). the history of the main campaing lacks of epicness... i feel some sidequest are more enjoyable/fun than the main story.",60.5
"its got a 94 meta critic review. what else do you need to convince you to buy this game? oh, you do need more? well then. i mean jeeze there are dragons and witches and assassins. just buy the game already. i have, for my xbox, pc, and ps3. just get the darn thing. you know you want it.",151.9
"skyrim is as open ended as a game has ever been. ive logged over 100hrs and am yet to even get deep into the main story line, and theres just more and more to do. plenty to do, and excellent mod support makes skyrim my 2011 goty. so play skyrim!",324.2

"bethesda did it again! amazing game. beautiful graphics, and the music.... oh the music! that being said, it is a bethesda game, so expect massive and multipule bugs and glitches. the mod community supported by the nexus and steam workshop help to solve many of these problems and add many optional additions to the game including races, items, homes and quests, let alone to say many more neat things. if you ever were a fan of the elder scrolls franchise, than this is a must. i also recommend getting this game on sale. the legendary edition is worth it and could save you money for extra content.",431.4

"skyrim is sprawling, generous, gorgeous and ambitious. it does what few games can: thoroughly follow through on its ambitions. it could be possible to play only this game for the next year and still not discover all of its mysteries. ive put in more than a 100 hours into this game and still not even halfway done through the main story quests. fantastic game if youre looking to immerse yourself into another realm for a good few hours at a time.",153.4

"love this game. i played alot on my 360 but breaking down and getting it for the pc was a great descision. i already am a big fan of tes games dating back to daggerfall but this one is just splendid... and thats just the vanilla game. just about anything you want to change can be with the tons of mods on the workshop and nexus and it makes the game seem even more personal because you made it just how you wanted it. before modding i would give it a 9/10, after a solid 10/10 its a great game in its own right but with the addition of mods it goes from great to amazing.",329.4

"to date, this is still the most enjoyable and diverse game i have played, i have played around 10 different characters, 10 different ways of approaching quests (started in different cities), leveled different skills, and every character was a new experience, apart from the fact that you do the same quests, sometimes the order in which you do them, open up new quests, or you can do the actual quest itself differently which results in the outcome being different.",534.1
"this was the first elder scrolls game i played. i really like it, but i feel they concentrated heavily on the scenery/graphics rather than everything else. i had to do a lot of pretending while playing, and a lot of modding when i bought it for pc to make it generally immersive. i wish there was a kind of but not really option in the middle of the yes/no recommendation. its one of those games where ill play it for a really long time and be incredibly into it, but then i end up being completely untinterested suddenly and will have to stop playing for several months before i become re-interested in it.",160.6
"i do highly recommend this game for anyone, even novice players of rpgs like me. it is in the classic bethesda style, with little tooltips that pop up with everything you havent used or clicked on yet which is a slightly intrusive but-not-too-intrusive, well-used way of teaching you how to play. if it isnt in your steam library yet, youd better be about to buy it.",211.2

"skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time, this game is pure art, the role play is great if you are a nerd like me, however if you dont plan on role playing and you just want to play an amazing game then you can unlike other titles like fallout this game does not punish you and it is not a very hard game, i played it in master for most of my stay in the land of skyrim. this game is the kind of type game where it is not about the end its all about the journey. i have played a lot of rpgs in my day, and in most the quests have been bland and the main idea was to explore however this game can be both the quests are great, the story is great the map is amazing, yeah there may not be as many random encounters like fallout, however when exploring you will allways find something new, and as we are pc master race we also get the privlage of mods that add alot more to the game which is amazing, i mainly enjoyed some of the modded quests, and horror quests. if you dont have this game by now f*cking buy it jez 10/10",212.9

"lots to do. lots of exploration. tons of mods-can enhance just about everything if you so desire. main quest is decent. some of the factions arent quite as good, storywise, as they were in oblivion but they are still pretty fun. the combat and leveling is a bit better than previous games. nice perk/skill up system. overall a good game.",87.1
"this is by far, one of the best games to hit the gaming series, people may know this game for its qwerky jokes and viking themes, yet it is so much more. it offers well over 300+ hours from the base game branching of to atleast 1000+ with mod support and dlc. elder scrolls v: skyrim lets you play the way you want in the most expansive and adventurous worlds ever. have fun and enjoy slicing, stabing, burning and hacking your way through this amazing game :d",387.6
"i personally think this is one of the best open world games ive played so far, aside from oblivion and morrowind. skyrim, to me, seems to be a watered down version of an elder scrolls game, but with much better graphics of course. its fit more for console gamers, but this is still an awesome game, i actually like playing this game with a controller to be honest. if you want a more in depht, complicated elder scrolls game, buy oblivion or morrowind. i also like the fact that this game has a steam workshop where you can download mods for your game to alter your experience, whether itd be graphics, new hair styles, weapons, quests, just about anything you want to add to your game. definitely a must have if youre a fan of open world fantasy games that let you do or go wherever you wish.",249.5

"even though this game is seven years old now, skyrim is still my all-time favorite rpg adventure. what it lacks in default graphics it makes up for in mods and overhauls produced by the gaming community, making your skyrim equal (if not better) to most games on the market today. as far as content goes, if youve finished every quest, explored every cave, and cleared every dungeon, then there are plenty of fantastic quest mods out there and i doubt ill get bored of skyrim any time soon. be sure to check out the skyrim nexus for the latest and greatest mods to keep your game looking fresh. sorry for the rant.",166.3

"i had been skeptical for a long time before buying this game due to its extreme popularity, but a few months after its release i picked it up and found that the hype was well-worth it. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an immmensely immersive world filled with a ridiculous amount of sandbox playability. 100+ hours in and id barely scratched the surface of the main storyline and gone and done a ton of side-quests. add to this an exceptional modding community and you have a great and refreshing game that it sure to provide a ton of replay value. critiques include dialogue thats made to be immersive, but the lack of variety in random dialogue only hounds the fact that this is a video game instead of a live world, some texture and model issues that can be easily fixed with new mods (if you have a good computer), and some random gameplay and quest glitches (also fixable through some community patches). overall the this doesnt overly detract from the mood of the game, and this entry in the series has definitely made me a bigger fan of the series in general.",14.2

"i figure since i have enough games to tower over a 6 foot tall man, i should at least give you the one i enjoy the most on my computer. the main reason i love skyrim on the computer is because there is always a way to get new content, without having to wait for bethesda to spoonfeed it to you. i think that skyrim is one of the besy rpg style games to date, and its modding community only adds to it. if there is one game im not ashamed to say that i own more than 1 copy of, and have dumped well over 700 hours total into, its skyrim. its a game that every story-loving gamer should own, and is a prime example of an open world done right.",197.0

"10 reasons why i love skyrim: 1. in combat you can have a lunch break: eat a truck load of bread, cheese rolls, apples. dont worry, your enemy will wait. 2.the shout fus ro dah has two uses: in combat and removing your braindead ai partner out of the way. 3.can achieve suborbital flight thousands of years ahead of spaceflight (aka get hit by a giant). 4.there are more dragons then soldiers in cities. 5.carry trillion arrows and gold - no wight. carry about 10 scales: overweight bi*ch. 6.bandits have better equipment then guards. 7.can kill hundreds, cant kill a captain of a camp. 8.dont have sleep for years, rest 8 hours - well rested bonus. 9.all people think you are a psychologist: they tell all of their problems. 10.save a town from a dragon attack, the next day none of the residents give a damn.",75.3

"having played over 1,000+ hours on console and now having picked up the pc version and getting to play around with some of the mods, i can now without a doubt say that this is my absolute favorite game... ever. this game has me at a loss for words to explain its amazingness, it truly is a spectacular game. graphics wise it is ever so slightly outdated but, not to the point where it is a pain, just some really low res textures here and there. the gameplay is incredible, out side of the melee combat which is a god-awful ms1 spamming pile of crap, that is compromised mainly of aiming your courser to make sure it hits and watching their health bar as you spam away. the in-game elements such as the magic and the shouts are very fun to play around with for example, one of the starting shouts, if not the starter, unrelenting force, allows you to ragdoll people to your hearts content, whether it be a bandit, or even giant naked men. anyways, more to the point, this game is tons of fun if your someone who enjoys deep rpg experiences like myself, if you are someone who likes more fast-paced and more linear games, or basically any genre that isnt rpg, id still say give this a try, you never know.",85.5

"my friends are all out playing dayz, and what do i get? skyrim duty this has to be one of my favourite ever games, although i admit my playing hours do not back that up so much. none the less skyrim is nothing less then brilliant. ive never really understood the meaning of immersion until i played this game, the sandbox freedom coupled with the sheer beauty of the landscape, the lore that follows the series is incredibly detailed and just enhances the entire experience. the quests are incredibly varied, though the dungeons do become a little repetitive at times, and as good as the voice acting is, the ai do repeat themselves a lot throughout the game. a friend of mine recently introduced me into the realm of modding skyrim textures and it doesnt stop there. the texture mods, though load heavy for pcs, are absolutely stunning, they turn what was already a beautiful game into something that makes real life look like a 2d scroller from the 90s. there are an huge range of mods from quests to map additions and even to realism mods, making the game virtually unable to bore you. i could go on and on about how this game deserves your attention, but i cant be bothered, so i will leave it like this: if you enjoy sandbox games, and you have not played any elder scrolls game before, give skyrim a go! 10/10",65.3
"the appeal of skyrim is its immersive open world that offers countless hours of exploration and questing. compared to older entries, the gameplay has been streamlined for a casual approach. constant micromanagement of attributes and preplanning of skill advancement is a thing of the past and you can just play without the worry of accidentally ending up with a dud character. while skyrim offers arguably the most enjoyable gameplay of the series, it lacks the depth of morrowind and has much weaker questlines than oblivion. the ui is also frustratingly atrocious. thankfully, the thriving mod community can address these fallacies and allows you to literally tailor the game to however you want. skyui and the unofficial patches are addons that everyone should get regardless of how they play.",498.4

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",248.6
"usually i dont write reviews but im making an exception here. all in all, this game is pretty solid. its not the relevation everyone hyped but it is a somewhat pleasant surpise in the ever-ongoing casualization of games (easier, less story, less playtime etc...). with 60 hours i completed all the quests i wanted and for todays game standards this is very high (ac2: relevations took me 9 (boring) hours). it has an amazing open world to discover, so may skills and perks, and you can learn them all :d (i destroyed the game with sneak, invisibilty and 32x assassination damage). some of the side-quests are really good (thieves guild, markath). the main sortyline starts amazing, decreases steadily and after a boring ending the main quest just dissapears and everyone is moving along despite their world being in uttermost danger a few minutes ago. there are an incredible amount of dungeons to explore but they all looks similar, the enemies are almost always the same and the are only 2 types of stoopid riddles. also, the number of spells is really low, like 25 or so, and they are not creative at all. tldr; play this game if you - love open worlds - dont mind hundreds of collect this and kill that quests - get a boner on high quality graphics - like dragons, because you will see them a lot - dont mind the crappy main storyline",65.6
"now, dont get me wrong. skyrim is an amazing game... ..when it works. it worked for about 15 hours after i purchased it then the main menu got glitched. whenever i start the game it doesnt show continue, new game, or anything. it just infinitely loads. ive tried everything i can think of, uninstall, reinstall, google... nothing i had this on the xbox 360 since the day it came out, and am still playing on my save on there. but on the pc it is just broken, atleast for me.",43.0

"-skyrim; im not sure how i can review this, never having played older tes games, but i can safely say, after a better playthrough, this is a good game. -gameplay is pretty varied, ranging from full-on combat, using magic, or my all-time favourite: sneaking. -combat... isnt brilliant. it isnt stiff like a rock, but still a bit rough. it has some dinamic though, like executions, different attacks for different directions, and special effects like extra damage on undead, or freeze damage on stamina and magicka, etc. -as for quests, i feel like the game really shined in the guild quests, the companions, college, and thieves. but was lackluster on early-game story missions. that being my opinion though. -side missions are interesting at least, but some are/seem boring and occupy space on your journal. -the leveling system works a bit weird, differently from what im used to. by getting good at a skill: one handed, destruction spells, lockpicking you gain overall exp, then you use tab and click level up, not fully fond of it. -overall, id give it an 8/10 since a max rating has to be a perfect game for me, and i have not found one yet. -leave your feedback below. thanks",42.5

"great game, endless stuff to do, everyone who likes rpg should try this without a second thought",33.4
"this, so far, has been my personal favorite rpg. if you feel like this game is a little boring, there are mods for it in the workshop or at skyrimnexus to increase this games experience on how you play it. be careful on which mods you get, some mods may cause the game to crash if you dont have the dlc or if they are conflicting with other mods or have not been updated yet. and now elder scrolls online is on the way, i wonder what would the online version of this rpg be like.",489.9

"i think skyrim is a well thaught out game and very detailed. great job bathesda! i really like open-world games and medieval adventure games, so this is a great game for me.",466.7
"been playing since the day it came out and i am still finding new thingto do everywhere i go. well worth any price you pay for it.",197.9
"yes! so many playthroughs i have done, and after beating the game several times there is still more to do. side quests make the main quest count look minimal, and fights require skill and the ability to plan things out ahead.",163.9
"skyrim is my favorite game of all time by far. every pixel, every dialogue, and every single quest had 110% effort put into it. the enviromental graphics look visually stunning. people upload screenshots of amazing views from mountaintops and forests as if they were scenic views from real life. anyways, i definitely recommend this game. great work, bethtesda softworks. 6 out of 5 stars. -dovahdude",267.7
"the ctd bug is a bit annoying, but the game itself is a great game. i would recomend this to anyone who enjoys a good rpg.",563.5
"if your computer can handle it, youd be crazy not to buy this. very fun game.",123.4
"it gets really boring...really fast...and the combat is really really stale.. also, when your first impression of a game is why the hell is everybody killing me over a chicken, you know you havent done a good job.",1.6
"so many differant playstyles, stealth,combat,friendly,. ive recently began playing it again and it is amazing so many differant wavelengths and opportunitys 10/10 also play this with mods which then make it more fun xd good playable fps on average computers so dont worry.",16.0
"the best open world game made so far in my opinion. mods make it even better.",571.6
"this game is just so awesome and fun, i bought my version from eb games for $47 bucks, its the legendary edition (contains 3 dlcs and in-game extras), but yeah like i said before, awesome and fun game, i absolutely recommend buying it! ;)",28.0

"very fun love all the sidequest and added on dlc quests my rating 10/10",58.7
"been out for a while now but i still come back to it! if youre a fan of rpgs and havent played this one yet, pick it up. this game is worth hundreds of hours by itself, and when you add in the massive amount of mods that have been and are being created for this game, skyrim is something you will come back to. definitely worth it the price.",266.2
"this game is the greatist game i have ever got i started only thinking this looks good but boy was i wrong. the story is massivly addictive. and you can always find or go somewhere new no matter how many times to restert the game. then you add all the mods in to the equation and the possabilitys for the gave become endless. the grates game i have ever had.",305.2

"one of the most beautiful open world rpg i have ever played, the music, the enviroment, the characters, everything is awesome! the only bad thing is that the game is too good and addictive.",44.3
"there is no other game that i can think of that comes close to this in scale or atmosphere. a huge volume of mods to accommodate every whim, or should i say fetish and if you have the pc power you can improve the visuals from the what is essentially good up to gorgeous. a big thanks to the modding community for improving what was already a great game  cant recommend this enough.",94.7
"this is the kind of game that even after 200 hours i keep finding new stuff. play on harder diff if you want more fun!",238.5
"if you know me, you know that i play an awful lot of this game. lots. o____o so to be up front, this is a very biased review. i love this game. i love playing it on pc. its great, after a long day at the office, to sit down icewater in hand and start running the road from falkreath over to markarth and up to solitude. its just a blast dealing with what you find on the road. im not delivering any great new information to anyone after how long this game has been out but i dont even really play much else i love this game so much. instant adventure! c:",108.5
"all people should play this game........ now !!!!!!!!!!!!! best game since 11.11.11",92.2
"skyrim: the best fantasy rp (in my opinion). if you like fantasy, rp, individuality, and choices, this is the game for you. thanks to steam, nexus and a special thanks to all the developers, we players can get even more out of the experiance of playing skyrim. as a female gamer i find this helps meet might individual needs and style as a rp. im still new to steam. but so far it has been a blast. so far i have nothing negative to say. at this point i am a 100% costumer.",574.1
"the most fun time spending game i have ever saw when u understand the basics of this game its just sucks u into it :) 10/10 !",345.3
"300 hours in skyrim with more yet to play thats for damned sure. so many things to do... go questing, do some dungeon delving, snipe bandits with arrows, stare at the aurora borealis, drink mead, smash the draugr into bonemeal, pester the local giants, steal some items some shop, discover some ancient dwarven place, stand on a snowblown mountain side, help the local village with a pesky dragon, pick some ingredients and brew up some potions, craft some weapons / armor, drop your armor in an icey river and take on a sabercat in your skivvies. plus theres a lot of mods to check out. this is a great game with many hours of gameplay. highly recommended!",423.6
"i love all the elder scrolls games, this one though is by far my favorite.",46.5
"very simply put , the best game ive plaed in years. there is somthing here for just about everyone. so many hours of enjoyment for the money invested , the best bang for you buck on steam. this is a must have!",241.0
"simply fantastic. 9.9/10. two annoying things: 1) the leveling up is a bit unbalanced. at higher levels i became completely unstoppable, smashing dragons in 2 seconds each, even on normal difficulty. cant remember the name of the last dragon but he was also hacked to pieces in no-time; so much for the grand ending. 2) many quests are still repetitive. i can understand that it wouldnt be easy to add even more scripted content, but i am not fully satisfied yet. some quests are also a bit too long, or rather the dungeons or crypts or whatever are too friggin big at times. looking forward to the next one!..",137.3
"i went out and killed an entire village dressed as a chef with steel boots and gauntlets using lightsabers that came out of my hands. 12/10 best game ever",23.6
"at one point i had three copies of this game, and no, i wouldnt play them simultaneously. now that skyrim development is wrapping up, its a good time to comment on the extremely enjoyable time i had with it, starting from character customization to random nonsense in the overworld. this game was able to reach a very diverse audience and i would regard it as the aaa minecraft even in terms of what you can do and how the player can add to the experience. with the workshop and mods still going strong, dont expect this game to ever be forgotten, but readapted for coming generations of gamers. until elder scrolls vi maybe...",62.4
"i actually liked this game, but it was no oblivion. i did love the whole norse thing, though, cause im obsessed with that culture and mythology. none-the-less, this was a pretty good game, even if there are a lot of bugs and the horse looks ...",84.2
"if you havent played it already, theres no need for further speculation. best rpg in the milky way, period.",91.9
"came across my first enemy and immediatley made them a chicken. 10/10",20.9
"this game is absolutely amazing, not just for what it is, but for how much bethesda left the doors open for modding. playing this on pc is such a different expeience from playing on the ps3 or xbox 360, that it litterally is an entirely different game. every time i find myself beginning to get bored with it, i just look for new and different mods to change it up a bit, and im pulled right back into it again :)",296.5
"make sure to pack heavy because once you enter the world of skyrim, youre not going to be leaving any time soon.",120.8
"great gme overall, great side quests that are kind of more interesting than the main story and good looks will make you want to skyrim all day.... fus ro da",82.9
"great game lots to do! if you love rpgs this is your game!",65.6
"its an awesome game, long quests, great value. ing get it",65.6

"as a friend put it. visual amazeballs.great fun, immersing. set time aside, this game demands it!",1.8
"elder scrolls skyrim is a really fun game i suggest to any gamer out their",14.9
"i get lost in this game, espeacially when adding mods! over 200+ hours in on console, gunna pass that on pc :d",127.7
"despite being released a couple years ago, this game still remains an excellent play. i find myself picking it up every few weeks on xbox to play vanilla, and steam to just mod the hell out of it and get some laughs. even if youve never really played a game like skyrim before, there is hardly a learning curve. with plenty of positive reviews already out there im sure mine will get lost in the mix, however if you are contemplating buying this game, do it. but dont go crazy with mods right away, beat the storyline, kill your first dragon, fus ro dah someone into the side of a wall and watch their body go crazy. then install any mods you want, you can even kill thomas the train with your 20 foot man-meat if thats what gets you going. easily a 9/10",25.1
"this game is just awsome - i cant get enough. 9.5/10",110.5
"its good, recomend to anyone with a lot of free time",34.0
"this game is quite good. the story is believable (for a magic and monsters story). it really gives you choice about what to do, as a lot of bethesda games nowadays do. the thing that would make this game better would be a little more variety in weather. i know that the province of skyrim is home of the nords and they come from a cold place, but by the end of the game you want to finish so you dont have to look at snow and gray all the time. its a rather bleak affair. even so, this game is a great one especially with the modding community doing so much to help improve the game. highly recommended.",93.2
"this game is so good, it should be mandatory. its just unending fun.",390.2
"great game, no other game like it and it has its plus because you can do more than you think in skyrim. totally worth ever penny.",357.4
"has to be one of my favourite games, highly recommend modding it for a much more unique and interesting playthrough. god bless.",444.0
"doesnt matter how leveled you get, how many skills you legendary how many perks you learn, how many quests you take, how many daggers you smith, how many swords you enchant, how many potions you brew, how many spells you learn, how many scrolls you use, how many guilds you join, how many dragons you slay, how many barrows you loot, how many skeletons you explode, how many locks you pick, how many daedra you meet, how many daedric artifacts you collect, how many bunnies you wabbajack, how many cheese wheels you steal, how many jarls make you thane, how many houses you buy, how many followers you recruit, how many atronachs you summon, how many shouts you learn, how many times you jump off of high hrothgar, how many civil wars you win, how many times you kill alduin. orcs still call you a milkdrinker.",648.1
"probably the best game i have ever sunk my mind into.",99.3
"i found skyrim to be immensely enjoyable. right from the word go you are able to make a character from multiple races and alter their appearance as you wish. after the tutorial you are released into the vast, beautiful world of skyrim. as you travel around the land you will experience breathtaking scenery, from snow-covered peaks to glowing caverns, and many unique caves/dungeons/ruins which contain a multitude of enemies from spiders to dragons. you can spend your time mastering the many skills available or completing quests, which there are a ridiculous amount available. in doing so you can gather equipment to allow you to create any kind of character imaginable. if you enjoy an rpg with freedom of creativity, dynamic combat and awesome scenery the skyrim is for you.",845.9
"huge, in depth and custimisable..... the elder scrolls skyrim is one of the best rpgs in history with and in depth skill tree, lots of races to choose from and over 150+ hours of content. note:the reason i dont have many hours on skyrim is because i used to play it on console but now i play skyrim on pc the way it should be played with loads and loads of mods",5.7
"skyrim has everything you want in a game. good visuals, good story, good combat, and a great amount of variety. this game does a great job at immersing you into this world and keeping you there. it has dragons, werewolves, magic, vampires, otherworld gods, dark elves, mystery, robots, tragedy, humor, awesome loot, and epicness. what you experience is based on how far you want to venture into this world and on top of all that, you have the steam workshop to add even more.",173.7
"ive put hundreds of hours into this game on the 360, and decided to get it on pc. the mod community is great and there are thousands of great mods that add new immersio to the game. my favorite game of all time just got better. 10/10",52.3
"its not like you dont already know you have to buy it to fit in. excellent, flowing, and well produced. killing moves can be a bit rough, and the physics engine is a bit wonky. downgraded from prior elder scrolls games as far as complication goes, and while there could be a bit more grit, its landing a solid 9/10.",483.4
"i really dislike this game.. i dont see what the public sees in it.. graphics maybe? but a god awful slow character with slow dynamics and mines that dont have ores in t hem? yea this game was an awful game to play. just awful.",19.8
"yes, its a good game. ill just write whats not good in this title. its like a huge total conversation mod for oblivion. the inventory system is a joke, hard to find items, makes you lose a lot of time. and i played it for a good 10 hours. its fun, but nothing more, not good enough to make me want to finish it.",9.5
"this game will eat up what little free time you might have, it is very very good.",125.1
"what can i say its elder scrolls 9/10 but with good mods 10/10",194.5
"this game is great value for money - especially with the three added dlcs of dragonborn, dawnguard and hearthfire. it can be a bit annoying to arrive back in whiterun and be instantly hacked to pieces by vampires, however, they do have some great kit that you can nick off them once youve given them the good news. being able to choose between following the set storylines or just wandering around the world aimlessly gives many variables to ones gaming experience, and of course the plethora of mods just adds nice customised play. having the mods easily accessible via the steam workshop is highly convenient. awesome game, awesome experience - play it now!",101.6
"got stepped on by a giant and went to space. 10/10",170.4
"although it has a seemingly complex storyline, and a useless tutorial, the graphics and the freedom you have in-game are absolutely amazing. skyrim also has a huge modding platform, allowing you to download various mods to keep you entertained.",47.7
"i love skyrim, i always had, even more now with the nice texture mods and all the extra quests and items",12.5
"this is a very immersive and fun game to spend hours playing. the sheer amount of content makes this game one of the best value propositions in gaming, in a very long time. this is a masterpiece of a western rpg, simply a must buy.",63.6
"nyan cat loves the elder scrolls skyrim it is an epic legendery awesome 666/666 10/10 buy it or i am gone kill you in game! ok?",534.4
"kill your enemies then rob them, what could be better? killing dragons and robbing them, thats what.",49.9
"i dont need to say anything about skyrim or other elder scrolls games. they are not compared to other games. other games are compared to elder scrolls. skyrim doesnt deny its origins and is a faithfull part of tamriels conturbated story. skyrim is epic. that would be enough to say but lets say something else as well. it b brings life to the northern side of tamriel as never done before and puts you into the role of the dovahkiin, the dragonborn, a hero, as those sung by bards, born with blood of the dovah, the dragons, and sets you in an adventure that you wont see anywhere else. you will brave the lush fields, snowy pastures, crowded cities and ancient tombs and dungeons of skyrim, where a battle for control is in place while dragons from the past are coming back to life. you will battle thru the guts of dragons and draugr, vampires and werewolves, and help comrades, thieves, assassins, companions and so much more that cant be said and done in these few lines. you are dragonborn and all the secrets of the world await for you!",151.1
"one of the best games ive ever played. back when i was a mere console pesant i had over a hundred hours clocked into this masterpiece. but now that i see this game on pc im never going back. from the beautiful views of the moon and mountains to the faciel expressions of the people in the cities. smithing and potion making has never been this great in any other game i have played in the past as well as the different perks that come with the races. all in all, i would recoment this game to my friends. stay fabulous people, -wordsmith",116.9
"this game rocks, large open world, no need to follow the main story, great combat, incredible detail, doesnt need a top of the line computer to run (actually runs better than my minecraft does 9_6), slay dragons, an anazing world to play in, npcs that are more than just props, giant spiders, vampires and werewolves. whats not to love about this game?",898.9
"skyrim....197 hours of play...... need i say more.",269.3
"very fun game, easy to drop a lot of hours in before modding.",73.4
"id hereby want to officially thank the modding community for endless replay potential. shouted a guard into a river, 10/10.",168.5
"excellent overall gameplay with countless hours of exploration and discovery. large modding community with regular dlc and patches. well worth the money especially if one can pick this up on sale.",940.7
"this is insane game, dont know how to start and i dont know how to end. it has and endless quest, pc version is the best i have ps3 version and i coudnt finish one quest because it keep crushing.",195.7
"i can not reccomend a game that has got more bugs than any game i have ever played and bethesda does not distribute patches to fix game breaking issues, they let the community do all the dirty work & keep all the profits for a broken piece of crap product.",52.0
"you need to play skyrim because it is a awesome game. and now you can mod it to. hahahahahahaha!!!!",521.3
"i like the pve (player vs entity) battle for example, fighting dragons. its just so fun :d and dangerous if you arent decked out in full diamond-emerald armor 0-0",56.9
"amazing i love this game!!! pair this baby up with creation kit and you can do anythingggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!! omg buy it while its on sale. i gt it for xmas and i love it <3 <3 <3",321.2
"just started to play the game i dont think i love it but i dont hate it. bought the legendary edition for $20 which was so worth. i reccomend buying this on sale if you dont own it allready.",33.0
"great game with a vast open world. if you havent played this yet you need to.",64.9
"skyrim has a pretty good environment and really nice ambient music. there are a few interesting quests involving the lore but most of the main quests are just go into this dungeon and get this relic or shout or whatnot. you would get a lot out of this game if you like exploring, even if there isnt much to do past looking at cool, varied landscapes. also, if you like modding scenes then this is worthwhile to look into. the steam workshop is really good and easy to use and if you want even more depth you can find more mods online. if its under $10 and youre an explorer or fan of modding then check it out, otherwise pass.",75.8
"needless to say, i <3 tes games... all of them, so if youre looking for an unbiased opinion, you need not read further. im not going to sit here and ramble on about skyrim as though this were a review, because its not; its a recommendation. so here goes: buy this game! awesome, yeah? i will give you a few points to go on though... first off, the game is huge in every aspect. not as large as other tes titles with regard to world-space, but more than large enough to get lost in. the amazing part about this, though, is that among the massive amounts of audio, texture, and other various resources, the game weighs in at ~5 gigs. no joke. second, the modding community has really put some excellent work in out there. so while i can spend a few hundred hours on it getting every single achievement and doing most everything that i wanted to, i can come back way later and start playing what feels like a shiny, new, awesome game!",1351.3
"talos... akatosh.. divines...! bring me a game that isnt  next time!",2.4
"the sheer size & scale is immense,plus the level of detail thats been put in means that after 70 hours im still not bored or have explored half the map! well worth buying :)",102.0
"a game so huge that you may have to play more than 400 hours!!!!!",478.0
"if your looking for bad  game with non stop adventure, well then your  is in the right place!",137.3
"this is the single most immersive game i have ever played. the actual gameplay is fantastic, the leveling system derived from gurps is stellar and you can explore the land all you want and still find something new. skyrim is, without a doubt, legendary.",177.9
"one of my favourite games of all time. have you played elder scrolls before? no problem. skyrim is full of fun references to earlier games. its a little different from morrowind and oblivion but still extremely good. i dont feel like ive wasted any money buying this, nor do i feel like ive wasted a single hour. the game is beautiful - i can stop in my tracks and just admire the world. there is so much to do, so many quests: main quests, faction quests, side qeusts, misc quests - youll never be bored. you dont like being bound by quests? no problem. theres no obligation to follow any quests, its possible to just explore and live the world. the levelling is easy and the game offers many different ways to play - rogue, warrior or mage to name a few.",619.1
"skyrim is the best game that i have played for the price (bought it on sale 7.59 i think). over 300 hours of gameplay literally and limitless mods and advances.",67.6
"playing through a second time, awesome game with endless mods to only make it even better",16.3
"skyrim is a pretty godd game, it came out in 2011 but you caninstall enb graphic mods and stuff to make it look like 2014 game. also it has a pretty good storyline. takes time to understand everything but its worth playing",141.1
"this game is one of the best game in the history of gaming. incredible story line, great graphics & to be honest... great everything! i really really recommend playing this game, its worth the time and certainly worth the money! 10/10",65.3
"forgot you couldnt look at the sun irl cause of this game now my eyes are broken 10/10",477.6
"dragon born character is so over powered it is not even woth buying this game !!! had to use walk-through on internet to build the house, it is not possible to work out steps from game. storyline is confusing. use soul gems to power your weapons. too much running from point-to-point.",6.3
"game is very entertaining and would totally recommend it to all rpg/adventure players!",82.2
"its fun i reccommend all the tator tots play this game.",42.4
"its okay it fills the space it passes the time its got predecessors which are superior in every way except graphics",112.8
"this game, with the online version coming out, is just everything i wanted after i played morrowind and hearthfire. i loved the improvements from the last games, in terms of graphics, npcs, getting rid of that follower (i hope. havent fully completed it) but if you are going to play it, watch out for a lot of talking. still a good game, and got a great background and fun too. i love tripping over in the inn in helgen by accident. i laughed so hard. but im ruining the story. go buy it!",122.8
"bad storyline, lack of depth, still has a leveling system, difficulty is scaling is pathetic, why should i want kill alduin? what did he ever do to me? didnt he save my life at the begining of the game? thanks alduin for saving me but know i hate you and have to kill you. and what happened to mysticism?!?!",49.3
"this is by far my favorite game. you have a huge open world to explore and it just never ends. quest after quest you will find yourself playing it more and more which isnt bad! 10/10!",71.2

"it is one of greatest game i ever bought it. i play for unstoppable hours and i love it! the elder scroll never disappoint me.",45.8
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"its nice until you realize just how empty and shallow it is.",127.1
"its a really gripping game which due to all the mods available is still capable of having modern graphics. there is a great story and many different sidequests awaiting completion. i would thoroughly recommend this game to most people and i know that it is one of my favourites.",72.6
"while the game is critically acclaimed the combat gets repetative. however the game is still fun because of the rpg elements such as gear, leveling and finding dragon shouts. i would recommend mods because they can flesh out the combat and make the world more appealing/realistic.",467.2
"this has to be the best game i have ever bhought... its a game for almost everyone... plus it has tons of mods in the nexus!",317.4
"skyrim is legendary. its an open-world, with a fantastic freedom to the storyline that makes you want to play the game again and again, and i have at least 6 times now. its epic and will definitely be on my top games list for a really long time.",160.4
"vanilla game is cool but mods are where this game really shines and you should definetly get at least skyui.",418.0
"the elderscrolls series is one that will never let you down. skyrim did not disappoint and for a series that had already raised the bar so high thats saying something. breathtaking visuals and endless gameplay where you can play however you want. tons of mods and great community as well. in one word epic.",304.2
"its like lord of the rings, harry potter because of the magic and minecraft because of mining, smelting and gathering. 10/10",46.6
"this could quite possibly be the greatest thing ever invented by humans. ever. period. exclamation point.",533.5
"i know its 4 years late for me to write a review but i still meet people who have never played an elder scrolls game o_o! so for those looking at this...just buy it! this game is a masterpiece and we need more games like this. not to mention with the addition of mods makes skyrim that much better. somehow here on steam people have left negative reviews on skyrim. i dont even understand how skyrim can have a single negative review aginast it other than trolls buy the game 10000/10",442.1
"is this the greatest game ever? i would say it is way up there in the running. immersive story, good gamplay, hack-and-slash combat, deep and vaired npcs, and hundreds of easily installed mods combine to make this an extremely satisfying play experience. there are still several bugs (many have been fixed by the community and are available as mods), but these can be easily overlooked, and are not gamebreaking. my only wish is that i could have played it on a better pc so i could have seen the full expereince of the graphics. conclusion: play this game. no excuses.",285.5
"skyrim is a open world game fill with adventure and places to explore there also many fun mods that add alot to the game you should not wait to buy this one!",39.3
"get a great computer for this game. then get every reccomeded graphics mod there is. then fap to the pretty colors.",309.7
"this game is amazing even with or without dlcs, but for mods or other content i should recommend getting to legendary edition. i havent even hit the limit of completing all the side/main quest so it makes the game make you play 500+ hours. i honesly would recommend this game to anyone that a fan of roly playing gamer or not a fan of them. for a 2011 game its still better then most games now.",116.5
"never played an elder scrolls game before this but was tempted by the hype of eso so bought their anthology and its more than lived up to its reputation - i cant say enough great things about this game. anyway im hooked so back to questing, exploring and decision making",129.3
"great game, no need to explain. everyone knows this game at this point.",116.2
"for me this game is the standard by which i judge all other open world rpgs. almost endless quest paths and character development are possible. the level of detail and the amazing mod community are also a huge plus.",145.9
"this is a beautiful, amazing, and incredible game all around. its my new obsession!",240.3
"dovakhiin, you are the mightiest of all, the best of the best, (unless you kill a chicken) you slaughter dragons no problem, and you murder every good and bad monster, with a wide array of weapons, spells, and shouts, this easily outsells other crap games. be an assassin, knight or a dangerous magician, who knows. with almost full mod compability, you just cant stop playing! 9.5/10, some bugs still remain (and 1 of them is gamebreaking) but, download the unofficial patches, and most of them are awaaaay.",107.4
"not much of an rpg players myself....but my friend bought me this game for my b-day and i fell in love with it the from the start. simply amazing!",144.5
"one of the greatest game i ever owned. it is awsome is every aspect (especially with gameplay, storyline & rpg elements) and definitely a must get for this year.",86.9
"9/10 this is a great game and one of my favourite i have ever played. but im reviewing it on its basics. no mods. it gets a bit boring without mods but you can always add them.",96.0
"there isnt much to be said on skyrim that hasnt already been said. skyrim isnt perfect, but it was my first big game. i wish more games had the intense characterization options as most bethesda games, as it adds another level of fun for me i miss in a lot of other games.",746.5
"skyrim is awesome made in 2011 and still the graphics are amazing 10/10",108.5
"skyrim is a very fun game. i really like not having a preset style of character i can choose to switch from magic to heavy weapons to archery and you choose whatever kind of armor you want. i prefer heavy armor to ignore damage 1 handed weapon in right hand and destruction magic in my left hand. the ability to switch weapons and armor allows you to combat foes that are weak to certain damage and strong to other kinds of damage. the only downfall of skyrim is not realizing how long you are playing. you can very easily spend 12 + hours in one setting.",340.6
"i love playing this game. the depth of lore is immense.",231.7
"lets make short and simple: if you are on steam, and you dont own this game, then youre doing it wrong. wrong. the game is immensley vast, atmosphere is so.. cool. the game will just suck you in. it has loads of contents that will keep you busy for 100+ hours for sure. and mods are just icing on the cake; if youre a graphics-hungry person, mods can make this game look better than most next-gen games out there, if modded correctly. and the sceneries, oh the sceneries, i just feel like sitting on my chair and just keep staring at those vast fields of beautiufl grasslands. totally recommend this game. 15/10. but, but, one and only con that i found is of the fighting mechanics; it is just so bland. nothing else i dislike about this game.",258.0
"you dont beat skyrim, skyrim beats you. skyrim is a near-endless rpg adventure, pick a direction and go and youll always find something interesting. while the combat isnt as refined as it could be the game makes up for it in sheer scale. i strongly recommend taking advantage of all the amazing mods.",413.1
"scream at a man, he dies. scream at an undead, it dies. scream at your friend, he lives. 11/10",108.2
"best open world game that has ever existed. good storyline, good spells, good weapons, and the shouts. this is a perfect game for people to experience a world of endless fighting. you can be a good person of fighting dragons and killing thieves and bandits or a bad person and kill people, steal things, pickpocket, and much more. i recommend this game 100% for anyone.",51.2
"ok..... where to begin.. ow... here this game is awesome !!!! if your fan of anytype of game like good story, good combat, funny dialogue,.....whatever comes to your head....this is it it has good community whit loots of mods, upgrades, new quests and list is on and on...... soo if i could shout  awe sooo meeeeeeeee soo i recommend it for anyone!!",183.8
"to be honest, do i really have to say anything? if you are human and you have money, get this game. dont even think twice, just get it. reating: ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() i dont feel like counting... alot of parenthesis! (alot)",203.4
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a very good game in my opinion. being a person who very much enjoyed the other games in the elder scrolls series i believe this one is another game in the series that adds a lot of great gameplay features and replay value.",740.2
"this a very well made game, it has days of game play, amazing game feel, a huge area to explore, things to do around every corner. you can be what ever you want, a warrior, a mage!, a theif, a necromancer, a mage-theif-warrior, a badass, anything! the story is amazing, in addition to this the game can get extremly imersive! listen, i could go on forever on how this is a great game, so just please get it!",546.4
"this is one of my favorite franchises. the game is huge with so much to do. such a drain on life, but well worth it!",69.5
"i played this game for 2 days non-stop. no sleep. but i think, worth it.",61.8
"very fun. after i finished all of the main stories and content, i did do some console fun so i could just go god-like on enemies. more and more fun over time. constantly enthralling.",169.6
"i had put a couple hundred hours into the ps3 version and just got it for pc. with the wealth of mods, im quite sure this will keep me busy for a long time. this game is probably my all time favorite.",43.9
"hours and i mean hours of play, very good selection of mods every pc owner needs to own skyrim !",1114.9
"excellent game, i like how even after you complete the main story there are still loads of quests to complete, and with the workshop there are even more quests",57.9
"a thoroughly immersive, gigantic and - most importantly - fun game to get lost in for ages and ages. skyrim delivers an absolutely stunning opportunity to build your own story, tailored to your own wishes. on top of that, modding capabilities ensure free long-lasting and highly individual enjoyment.",259.1
"while my initial opinion of this was rather high, eventually i found it rather lacking in variety. bethesda needed more time to work on it, and it shows, with various small glitches in the game, and repetitive dungeons. mods are what make it good. without them, i wouldnt recommend this game.",20.5
"awesome game! open world, choose and craft your story by completing quests the way you see best fits! magic, dragons, and many other creatures and lifeforms to fight and interact with as you travel across the lands of tamriel! hone skills that you want to master and aqquire a deadly skillset to decemate your foes! large weapon varieties as well as a decent amount of clothing to choose from make for an even more immersive experience as you really feel connected to your character, so dress your character as you choose. also, along side a few mods, skyrim just never ends, mods adding in new questlines, creatures, characts, weapons and armor, as well as graphical improvements to make your game look as beautiful as you wish! all in all this game will provide you with hours of enjoyment and you will notice time flies when you play as the lust to complete quests and slay your enemies grows after each quest, you complete one quest which leads to another and so on, highly reccomend this game for anyone who enjoys medieval settings and combat styles, myths and so on. 10/10 :)",126.7
"amazing! i didnt particularly like morrowind, so i never continued to play through the elder scrolls, but skyrim is amazing!",9.6
"this game is the best 100/10 mod it til it crashes i have so many mods definatly worth it you can do anything it came out 3 years ago but the mods keep it going i played 100h and i regret nothing it is amazing",189.3
"if youve lived under a rock for the past 2 years you might not know that this is a good game. has its problems, bugs, ect, but its a great game. the combat system suffers from being either too complicated (as a mage or whatever) or being way too simple (as a basic warrior / archer)",458.2
"excellent, well rounded in every way. imagine got on steriods. 10/10 dlc is amazing as well",89.6
"its skyrim. it came out in 2011 on the 10/11/11 (broken release date) hated it at first; too much like fallout 3 for an elder scrolls game i thought. fast travel a few years later and i seem to quite like the game, dont know what happened. i still prefer oblivion but hey, its the elder scrolls, the series has been going on now for 20 years, you know what your getting in to. 8/10",13.5
"a brilliant game, just gets a little stale if you need to redo the whole story",8.2
"massive lag on my laptop for playing this, id rather play it on console, amazing graphcs and gameplay! 10/10 ~medicshy",7.0
"the game it self is good, but the combat is really slow. this results in you not being able to win a fight if there are more than one enemie. 4/10",8.7
"this game is sooooo much more enjoyable on pc! steam workshop is awesome! workshop keeps this game fresh and not as repetative as the console versions!",47.5
"best. game. ever. i had already completed this game a few times on the console, but the pc i just far superior. i would recommend this game to anybody that likes fantasy/rpg style games. well, what are you waiting for.... buy it today! you will not be disappointed.",21.2
"10/10 would play again, not the main story however. the side quests are where its at",57.9
"100% recommended! best single player game i have every played! period",298.2
"game. of. the. decade. favorite game. 100+ quests. amazing gameplay. good graphics (ultra high, mods) story of a decade. (except for the 40 minute cutscene). legendary customizability. mods of awesomeness. dlc? stellar. 111/100.",54.8
"why bother reading reviews if youre gonna buy it anyways??",117.5
"i absolutely love this game. bethesda is far and away the best gaming company out there right now, elder scrolls and fallout, i could play nothing but these two series for the rest of my life and be okay with it.",54.7
"havent really enjoyed morrowind, turned off oblivion after 5 minutes. played skyrim for 130hrs, i think thats enough said in case of is it good?. with mods this game turns from good to stunning. it never really ends, has cool first-person and really cool quests, but its not perfect. combat gets too easy after a while, dragons are bunch of c***s that never seem to land which is annoying when you just get set on fire and cant really do anything. a part from that, damn solid game, even beaten witcher 2 of which im a total fanboy.",170.5
"this game is amazing. there is so much to do and even when you think you are done theres more side quests and mods to further enhance the game play. two thumbs up.",564.8
"i wanted to like skyrim. for the first 20 hours, i actually kind of did. but the more i played, the more i realized how the characters, the story and the world are extremely uninspired and the quests and the combat are boring. it wouldnt matter to the npcs if i murdered the entire city guard or if i were the thane of every city in skyrim, they would still say the same bland things, performed by an extremely limited supply of voice actors. 50 hours in to the game, whatever quest i choose to do, it feels like im doing a chore. kill x, retrieve y, talk to z. it changes nothing, i just gain bigger numbers and make markers on my map disappear. thats it. the environments are beautiful (though they dont offer a great deal of variety) and the world is vast, but as mentioned, extremely static. no amount of modding can fix that, even though there obviously have been attempts at it. i just cant enjoy this game anymore, not even with all the mods i have installed.",49.9
"this game burned out my motherboard. 420/69 would kill heimskr again",348.6
"in skyrim, you can defy the laws of gravity, send isaac newton the good ol finger! fly horses off cliffs at distances you would never believe! jump up the sides of mountains where in real life, you would probably be gravitying to the ground! the only thing we forgot to add is a  you isaac newton line for whenever you perform one of these anti-newtonist feats! god i love this game. get it for the love of god. 10/10 would defy gravity again.",343.9
"best rpg ive played to date. there is nothing else like it out there. the leveling system is my favorite of all the games ive played because of its intuitive leveling-by-practicing functionality. extremely fun to play with hundreds of hours of content and replay potential.",441.6
"one of my most favourite games from one of my most favourite developers. such a beautiful, fantastic world to explore. skyrim surpasses its predecessor in every way. its like eating an eight course meal of various exotic and delicious foods with everything cooked to perfection and the portions being just right. and if there just happens to be something that isnt to your taste, then theres, almost certainly, a mod to accomodate. you can get lost in this world... all the way up until bethesda gives you another to get lost in anew.",392.9
"brilliant game! having it on steam is even better because of the workshop. make the game a thousand times better.",46.6
"amazing game, the moddability makes it epic! get nexus mod manager though, it is far better. you can get the game to load mods from both the steam workshop and nexus with a bit of work, as long as you are careful about conflicts. cannot wait for tes6, with next-gen graphics and tesselation it is going to be beautiful.",243.8
"just fantastic. 10/10. more play value than any other game on steam. thousands of mods extend play time for months.",107.5
"best single-player game ive played in years. simply incredible.",662.0
"this one took me 77 hours to get 41/50 on the achievements, including finishing the story lines for the thieves guild, the companions, the college of winterhold, the dark brotherhood, the civil war, and the main quest. not surprising to anyone is that getting married is one of the nine achievements i passed on. i wont get that one unless i have every other one from the main game and all its expansions first. i hate giving 10s, but this is the best role playing game ever made, and i dont even like fantasy all that much. it has no chance of being surpassed this generation and likely has no competition outside of its own developers for next generation either. i am not sure what could even be changed for the better, aside from an even larger world facilitated by more horsepower. 2014 beckons.",107.3
"i think skyrim is a awesome game to explore the world. fight bandits, skeevers, dragons. i just love skyrim and what it lets you do.",723.0

"best money spent on a game in a long time unlimited game play due to its modding community. the modding community are alwase adding more and more wonderfull content. i have to agree with best game of the year for 2013.",159.1
"i have only 8 hr in this game so far. starting nice . the enviroment is so good done that you wishes you are living in that world. great gameplay i miss that alot in a few other games. the music is pretty good in this game thought i not like computer games music so mutch. one thing i am getting mad about when you shoot bow. you never get tired when you hold up the bow before fire it as in reall life archer . you getting tired after 25-30 seconds in you arms. hope they gonna fix it. othervise i like the game so far.",77.6

"whats to say, its skyrim. if you like open world rpgs, killing dragons, and/or being a punchcat, its the game for you.",208.2
"definitely one of bethesdas best. an amazing sequel to oblivion, skyrim is an addictive game that immerses you into the realm of skyrim. it is all too easy to get lost in the gameplay. plenty of ways to play this game as well. from an assortment of magic, close range weapons, and archery, and using allies, summoning creatures to fight for you, sticking to the shadows, or wearing gallant suits of armour, you can play any way you chose",613.3
"420/69 you need to be truely mlg to play this game is warning if u ignore dis warn then loominarty will get yu omg",330.3
"amazing. no more words needed. this game has never dissapointed me, i have played it on xbox before i bought the pc verision. and i can tell you this much, this game will never get finished. they keep releasing new stuff all the time, so the game is possibly going to go on forever. 10/10",84.4
"are you ready for the slowest frame rate of your gaming career? well then download and waste 30 hours in bethesdas not fallout 4 game, skyrim. in skymall, you play as the swag god, dovahkiin or dragonborn, who minds you into a different dimmension with his spooky spaghetti squash that he inherited from some dude who nailed a dragon. your main enemy is some shrek looking dragon called alduiin who saves you from getting killed so i dont see why youd kill him but hey bethesdas bethesda. you know whats funny? bethesda doesnt even have their headquarters in bethesda in maryland. anyways, another main enemy is the imperial army, or the inbreds called the stormcoats. after you chop off alduiins uncircumsized , you use it in battle against whatever army you choose, but at the end of the day it doesnt even matter because every ing character looks the same and dont move their faces at all.  you",86.2
"skyrim features stunning and absolutely beautiful graphics, an amazing soundtrack and fun and intense gameplay. the game features a large amount of different quests and things to do, along with tons of customization and places to explore, things to read, skills to upgrade and more! skyrim is an amazing experience that cannot be missed. see if you can acquire a really nice high-end gaming computer to run this on; you want the beauty of this game to really stand out. highly recommended.",52.7
"after spending 400+ hours of playing this game on pc and 200+ on xbox, i can say with an avsolute certainty that this game will keep you entertained indefinitely. add a few mods and you will be reduced to cartman in the wow epidode of south park. if you dont want it, youre a special kind of stupid",423.6

"ive wasted my life on this game, ps3 and pc. ive probably spent hundreds more hours modding and getting mods to work rather than playing. 10/10 would play that. its got dragons and . stole my reccomendation, bethesda pls moar.",338.9
"this game has waisted hours of my life, and i dont regret a second of it. this game is stunningly beautiful and wonderful to play, its a gift to waist time doing pointless side quest and killing mudcrabs. this game will turn anyone into an open world rpg fan and they wont ever be able to turn away from the screen when theyre walking to whitrun to sell their crap or to make iron daggers at the blacksmith.",199.6
"best game ever made. i have just finished my 5th or sixth run through with all the major addons & played for 1350 hours. thats about 3p an hour. need i say more. with the pc version you can give yourself more money & carryweight, cheats, which definitly improves the game. the first 2 run throughs i played without cheats and the lack of money & frequent trips to sell loot became a pain. the flying/pass through walls cheat command is also helpfull when you are really stuck but i would suggest you don,t use it on your first 2 runs. there are only 2 instances where i have to fly.the forums will point you in the right direction if you cannot figure out a puzzle. so are the bug fixes altho i have only suffered a few. i would leave the other cheats alone.",1387.3
"if you are new to this game kill every chicken you see-trust me nothing bad will happen",94.4
"ahh good ol skyrim... i have spent almost 250 hours on skyrim (most hours played on console) but everytime i start a new character there is always something new to experience and watch for the first time almost as if you just purchased a new game. thats a great thing about skyrim. it sucks you into a deep and open experience filled with lots of interesting characters, landscapes, dungeons, weapons and many unique enemies to fight. bethesda really put hard work into this game and they deserve a round of applause. i love how you dont need to choose your class really. the skill trees allow you to mix and match various skills and attributes to your character which is really amazing to feel free to experiment with different skills and just overall have fun. the spells and weapons and armours in this game are astounding. there is so many items to find and spells to cast. i know skyrim has been out for a couple of years now and probably anyone reading this right now knows how truly amazing this game is. but if you havent gave it a try then you really should especially since elder scrolls online is coming out in the next following year. but anyways skyrim is truly and amazing game. i recommend it. and i know this may seem a little generic to say but this game is a masterpiece 10/10 im serious. drako signing out, peace! :d",44.3

"well, everybody like skyrim, everybody enjoy skyrim. obviously, me too, although after mounted level (very quickly, while maximum difficulty, thats a bit annoying), we can feel a certain weariness. but this game is the game of the elder scrolls saga. oblivion remain second in my opinion, even if without him we would not have skyrim. it is also important to note that after completing the game, a feeling of repetition can be felt in the exploration, but i think im influenced. after all, i redid this game a dozen times.",5.7
"skyrim is a really good game bit of a bummer thought that i cant play it on my new imac.",199.7
"skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played. between being able to travel to tons of places, having hundreds of quests, and being awesome with shouts i think it makes it that much better. with the quests, you dont even have to play the main quest if you dont want to. in fact there are several quests you dont have to participate in. its even cool you can choose your own path. like imperials or stormcloaks or neither. i recommend this game to people who love exploring, sneaking around to steal, or just want to kill people because they can. :)",479.4
"you are the dragonborn, dovhakiin his name, fight for peace and conquer a whole world of dragons! build your own homes, concider childs, marry, fight with sword or magical spells, build your own armor or swords, seal them with a magic spell, fight against many enemies, conquer the rebens when youre join the imperial army, or free the land from imperials when you choose to join the rebels, do what you want and go where ever you want, climp hills, catch fireflies or fishes, take quests, fight for the thiefes, or the dark brotherhood, join jovaskr and be a wherewolf, be a vampire to eat your enemies blood, be whatever you want and whereever you want, i can just say i like it if you like it, i dont know, just watch videos, read comments, its a great game and im glad to have it, wheee! skyrim! dovhakiin! be the dragonslayer and learn the voice shouts of the dragons, fear your enemies, freeze them, burn them, kill them all in special scenes, fight for skyrim, conquer the world, and destroy alduin! :-)",299.6
"paying to get trained in skills, then pickpocketing that money back later. 12/10",116.1
"skyrim is a game i would recommend to all players it has amazing graphics a good story and plenty of fun and dangerous quests to play through. the beggining is no different from most elder scrolls since once again the story starts with you being in prison or arrested. but past that skyrim opens you to a new world full of caves,dungeons,cities,camps,and houses all throughout the world. but i also have problems with the game since th pc version is very glitchy. i sometimes take armor off a armor stand and put new armor on it then come back to see the old armor has duplicated replacing the armor i had put on there. you might think oh you now can give that armor to your followers or sell it! but this happens nearly everytime you leave your house and it is very frustrating. the game also glitches on quests causing me to go back to previous game files which is bad and is something that needs to be fixed. but in all skyrim will always be one of the best games to ever be made. i have never seen any game like it and never will. 9/10",65.4

"i have always been a fan of the elder scrolls ever since morrowind back in 2002 and in my opinion this is a great sequel. skyrim is the most stunning game to look at in the elder scrolls seris however some graphical gltiches occur. skyrim has also the best modding community so far as after more than 3 years mod delvepors either in the nexus or the workshop are still cranking out great mods to help enchance the game. in the end you must play this game if you are looking for a great rpg experince or just a great game.",317.5

"if you havent already, buy this game!!! even at 15, skyrim is a masterpiece. the 3 dlc adds more hours to your over 100 hours of gameplay. plus modders never stop making content that improves the game further. this is what got me into rpg games. seriously, you have to buy this. its at a low price, but even better if you can pick it up during one of the steam sales. i cant express how great skyrim is. theres plenty of stuff to discover. just go and buy it already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",218.8

"time passes really fast when you are playing this game. the first six hours went by in the blink of an eye, my character is at level 10 and i feel like i have barely scratched the surface of anything. if you like these kinds of games, you will be hooked because bethesda has managed to create something which really nails it on every level. i am a heavily magic oriented player so i spent most of my time so far in the mages guild in winterhold. for some reason though the dark brotherhood wants me dead and sent an assassin to kill me. i was just messing around with some conjuration spells in a forest and the assassin was killed by this flame creature i had conjured before i even knew what was going on. looted the body and found a note saying they want me dead. stuff like that just happens and it is awesome. dungeons btw are really fun and very well designed. the bottom line though is that this game is basically like oblivion on steroids. if you liked oblivion and spent 200+ hours playing it like i did, you will be addicted to skyrim.",93.9

"breathtaking immersion, wonderful graphics, and endlessly fun gameplay makes this game a prize to own. there are some problems with it, though. to start with, the immersion is so complete, youre disappointed when a feature isnt there, like when a character cant talk with you. secondly, the wonder that encompasses gameplay the first time round just isnt there in later saves, and this can be a huge loss for such an awe-inspiring game. however, if youre willing to try out mods, theres no end to the content you can find. the final issue is how combat and even other skills can become incredibly unbalanced in the latter part of the game. my answer to this is, once again, mods. the community has done an excellent job of rebalancing the game. and any of these slight problems pales in comparison to the wonder and glee that will fill you when you kill your first troll, or join the companions, or successfully evade a way-too-powerful-for-you dragon. this is one of the greatest games i own, no doubt about it.",312.9

"so what to say about skyrim..... just that its one of the best rpg games iv played in a long time(since oblivion now that i think on it). loads of content to keep yourself busy for over 200+ hours and that is without mods! adding mods after the inital playthrough really sparks things off again. you could easily spend 1000+ hours on this game and it would always be new and exciting. the main problem is the combat, it seems very lack luster at times, usualy just mash/hold attack until enemy dies which does get a tad boring.",334.9

"last update received today will not allow me to play skyrim. steam is terrible. i dont recommend it.",662.3
"the province of skyrim might be frigid, but the role-playing game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess. in the elder scrolls v: skyrim, you take up arms against dragons, and your encounters with them are invariably exciting--yet depending on where your adventure takes you, such battles may not even represent the pinnacle of your experience. a side quest that starts as a momentary distraction may turn into a full-fledged tale that could form the entirety of a less ambitious game. yes, skyrim is another enormous fantasy rpg from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within. if you know bethesda softworks previous games, you might be unsurprised that skyrim is not a land without blemish, but rather harbors any number of technical glitches and frustrating idiosyncrasies that tear open the icy veil that blankets the land. many of them are ones elder scrolls fans will probably see coming, but theyre ultimately a low price to pay for the wonders of a game this sprawling and enthralling. prepare for many sleepless nights to come.",230.4
"skyrim is probably one of the best rpgs ive ever played. it never gets boring as there is always something to do, like derping around or serious questing.",96.3

"another great game by bethseda. cant wait for the next one, already beat in on console but it is 100x better on pc, 100% reccomend this game",25.5
"he is dragonborn! *falls of cliff and kills himself* yep that was how my first non story dragon fight went. anyway down to why i have decided to write this review. so skyrim is one of my new favorite games, i love it. i mean charging at a dragon to get that cinamatic kill and thoes times where you miss click and your character decides. *hmmm im fighting a dragon right now and i need to heal so let me just holster my weapon so i can get burned horrificly. so my verdict on skyrim is 9/10 not a 10 because i have moments where the game just says f**k you matt you aint going to take one more step or i will bluescreen you! overall a enjoyable experiance. dragon fus ro dah!!!!! *matt flys off into orbit*",93.8

"this is one of very few games that i find myself immersed in. i sit down to play for a little bit - do a simple quest, rearrange a chest in my house, and, seven hours later, i get out of my chair for a bathroom break before returning. it is so easy to get lost in this game. even though the graphics are kind of outdated nowadays, it is still a beautiful game, especially with mods. the storyline is awesome, especially the sidequests. the attention to detail is unlike anything that i have ever seen in a game. tiny little loose-ends that the average player would never even notice are subtly tied up all around the colossal open world. this is by far the best rpg that i have ever played, and i would definitely put it in my top three games of all time.",71.7

"with all dlc and patches, still very buggy. bethesda abandons its faithful and non-modding players to the realm of issues. all they had to do was borrow from the public. this game could still use better leveling and more creatures. they feel very spaced, rather than dwelling in certain parts. i emailed them once, trying to get an idea incorporated. they did incorporate my idea into skyrim, but i never even recieved an email back. they have zero customer loyalty.",145.8
"i love bethesda. skyrim was amazing. so much to do. does get a little boring if your already use to the mechanics of the game. if its your first time playing a game made by bethesda, this will no doubt be a wise use of your limited funds to add to your library. i highly reccomend this game to anybody. 10/10",226.7

"now, at 80 hours in, it still feels like its just the beginning. there is so much to do and explore that a perfectionist like me would feel overwhelmed at first. that is before you realize that this game was meant to be overwhelming, so that no matter how many play throughs you put in, there is always something new to discover. a lot of it is due to the immersive and dynamic world the developers have created. if you somehow manage to get bored or too familiar with vanilla content, the products of the mod community will keep you occupied for a long time. would i recommend this game to others? of course! downsides: you need a few weeks off work and a diaper.",84.6
"if you want the best rpg out there right now, the elder scrolls v: skyrim is for you. this is one of my personal favourites, alongside dragon age and mass effect (even though i was not satisfied with how the final mass effect ended). it has the same type of everlasting questlines, which i happen to really love. i wouldnt say its a difficult game, but its not exactly easy either. fairly simple to pick up on, too. even the mind of a more casual player could get the hang of it in the first few sessions they play it. skyrim is an amazing game and i would advise anyone who loves a long lasting, epic game to play this. there are so many choices...and it never really ends.",157.3

"significanly better than previous incarnations, with the possible exception of the expansion to oblivion, which was amazing. combat tended to be a joke from the very beginning, which was a problem considering that dragons were supposed to be some kind of apocalyptic threat (i mean that was the plot, right?) and by the end of the game you were smashing them in a single blow. also, i felt some of the plot ramifications of your decisions were unrealistic and tended to punish the player for no real reason. still, these were somewhat minor flaws. i very much enjoyed the game on the whole and wholeheartedly recommend it.",358.5

"fun game with or without mods from steam workshop or from nexusmods (best 1) this game is a must get!",115.5
"this isnt just a game, this is life! no really, i do not know of what one could dislike about this game. whilst it does scream like me as a game title, you cant help but love it as much as it wants you too. the storyline in skyrim is amazingly immersive the first time you play through it. while i played through it i felt a since of urgency to stop alduin and save tamerial from him. the only real downside to this game is that theres not really the ability to be an evil character per example, why not rule beside alduin instead of killing him? why not kill the greybeards once youve the ability to or kill all the jarls and declare yourself king of skyrim? the lack of options in those specific areas are a downside to it. however theres so much content here that youd be an idiot not to buy it. this game is to me, the definition of perfection easily the best game ive played through and then it gets even better with mods. case closed this is a 10 out of 10.",294.0

"this game is pure sex ! i fell in love with it the first time i played it 2 years ago. the coolest thing is that you can add mods if you are bored of the base game and youve been playing it for houndreds of hours. but the game is perfect the way it is : it has great graphics long campaign and intriguing storyline also addictive gameplay",111.9
"enter the snowy world of skyrim, where dragons swoop down every now and then looking to kill you just because they can. build your character and then install a bunch of mods before losing track of what you were even trying to do in the first place! a must buy for children of all ages!",126.8

"my favorite game of all time. this game really throws you in a world where you can be what you want to be.",75.0
"although i am not much of a pc gamer, playing skyrim was one of the best decissions of my gaming career. a massive open world, so many choices, and some decent acting, as well as countless adventures that you can send your dragonborn on; what more could you ask for, dlc? well, skyrims got dlcs in spades. theres hearthfire, which allows for the adoption of children and the construction of 3 actual mansions that dot skyrims landscape. then theres dawnguard, which brings in a force of legendary vampire hunters and a group of true vampires. and finally, theres dragonborn, which takes across the seas, of the coast of morrowind, to the mysterious island of solstheim, which in itself, is a huge enigma. face countless enemies, find legendary treasures, and save tamriel from a rising terror, formed from legends and stories of heroes and brave warriors. are you of dragon blood, or are you a snibbling, whining milk drinker?! i give this game a 9.8/10, for shear creativity, decent acting, and such a broad world that you can explore. :d",230.2

"epiiiic! i got this game two years ago on a different account, so my current 14 gameplay hours is a lie. this game, is so freaking awesome, you can replay the story line several times as different role-play characters. its such an open world game, you can do anything really. theres no building, but theres skills and smithing, etc. the combat mechanics are great, the graphics are great, especially on ultra (if you can handle it without lag). i always come back to this game to live out a different life each time.",15.0
"a beautiful game, with a rich and deep backstory. with inconsistant writing, watered down mechanics, entire skill trees that are utterly worthless, and poorly done perk system, useless magic, anticlimactic battles, huge streches of nothing, and so many fetch quests. there is one reason youd ever bother, and thats mods. unfourtunantly mods cannot fix what is a fundementally dull and unintersting game, that might as well not even have a leveling system. i have never played the older elder scrolls games, but lemme tell you, this game will make you wary of them. i can honestly say that the hundreds of hours i put into the ps3 version were entirely wasted. if you must have this game, go to the nexus site, and download as many dencent mods as possible. the game is far better when it spends more time crashed than letting you play this shallow pool of a game.",162.6
"honestly, this is one of the best games ive ever played. intense, innovative, and extensive gameplay wrapped up in an extremely well written engine, smothered in dialogue, enhanced with realistic random events, fighting, marriage (ing in certain modded situations), exploration, collection, magic, quarrel, war, and all of it topped off with an amazingly dedicated, hard-working, creative modding community (not to mention the visuals!). ive been playing this game for three years straight on and off steam. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is in my top five best games of all time. everyone should definitely get a chance to play this game.",8.7

"awesome, hours and hours of my gaming life absorbed. mods extend that to the nth degree. played it as every archetype you can imagine and its a new game.",152.3
"this is truly one of the best games i have ever played. an epic tale that allows you to play it however you want to. along with steam community and an entire modding community behind skyrim, the possibilities and adventures are endless. if you have not tried out the epicness of skyrim, i recommend picking it and living it yourself.",92.9
"bethesda delivers in the next instalment of the elder scrolls series. this emersive adventure allows the player a massive amount of freedom and choice as he or she takes the role of dragonborn. charge in to battle as a hammer wielding berserker, or kite your enemies as a masterful mage. lurk in the shadows as a theif or an assasin. the choice is yours. the possibilities are endless. above all, take the role of the savior of skyrim, choose your side in the epic civil war and bring an end to the terrible regn of the dovah, the dragons.",135.4
"awesome game, definitely pick this up if you havent already.",73.1
"bit shorter than previous elder scrolls and in my opinion not as good a game as morrowind and oblivion, but much more advanced gameplay and graphics and still amongst the best rpgs made.",32.1
"this game is absolutely amazing, not just for what it is, but for how much bethesda left the doors open for modding. playing this on pc is such a different expeience from playing on the ps3 or xbox 360, that it litterally is an entirely different game. every time i find myself beginning to get bored with it, i just look for new and different mods to change it up a bit, and im pulled right back into it again :)",296.5
"the best rpg ever made. it the most immersive, emotional, intense, highly interactive, incredibly deep, intertwining, moving, story evolving, character building, spell casting, axe swinging, bow bending, potion drinking, poison making, weapon smithing, metal casting, dual-wielding, quest making, home owning, dragon shouting, undead slaying, bandit bashing, child adopting, marriage making, sneaky, re-animating, breathtaking, stunning, book reading, dimension travelling, brightest, darkest, ore mining, stealing, companion making and enemy destroying so of a  i ever did come across ... i cant recommend this game enough, even if this type of thing doesnt interest you, i guarantee youll love it. good luck getting on with your day to day tasks ...",29.1

"fantastic game. re-playability value is very high.",194.5
"good game, but needs a good amount of modding to be great to the level of morrowind. 4 of 5. (the ease of modding is a plus) only flaw is that its a bugthesda game, with bugs present even now.",168.5
"if youre playing an elder scrolls game on pc and not doing an absurd amount of modding - youre doing it wrong.",517.9
"there is a plethera of content that has kept me engaged and craving more since ive started playing. anyone who has a decent computer and an urge to adventure must buy this game.",197.5
"one of the more open ended games that i have seen that still follows an interesting and complex story line. overall and amazing game that is a lot of fun to play.",457.0
"fun game and when your done with the main story line you can use the workshop to get extra stuff in yur game",181.0
"i just cant get enough of this game, im always want some more. and you know what? this game actually can offer you some more: -a lot of quests and ways to solve them; -beatiful locations to explore; -random game events between npcs and monsters which is interesting to watch (group of guards vs badss dragon, wolves pack attacking an npc, etc); -huge amount of mods, most of them just make grass greener, armor shinier, boobs bigger and turn horses into mlp characters, but there is some mods that can comletely change the whole game. you still not satisfied? theres 3 dlc with dragon riding, another dragonborn, new shouts, vampires, wolverines, crossbows, dirty orphans which can be adopt, your own house which you can buy or build, and also marriage (not a greatest decision in your life, but still) waiting for you. and achievement hunting, of course! trully 10/10",93.5
"its pretty and the fighting is streamlined compared to other tes games so as a stand-alone open world action-rpg, its fun. but it is definitely the worst elder scrolls game. skyrim takes a wood chipper to the delicately crafted lore of the series and then lays about five or six internet memes at its grave. you fight the same damn enemy for about 4/5s of the game, the leveling system and ui is so over-kill simplistic that it actually makes it harder to work, the shouts are hilariously stupid and feel like a bad mod, the music is unfitting and comes out of nowhere so randomly that it kills any mood. the main quest is absolutely terrible and bounces between characters that are either overly dramatic or completely uninterested in the games biggest focus, dragons. it basically has the presentation consistency of an elementary school play. if previous elder scrolls games try to humble you with the scale of the setting, skyrim tries to jack you off. and a little too fast to be enjoyable. if youre a fan of the series, im sorry. if youre from reddit, have fun.",54.9
"the game itself is a masterpiece of storytelling, mechanics and lore. just cant believe how compelled i am to always come back to it. i started on xbox and loved it so much that i bought it on pc too and gave that modding thing a shot. cant tell you how great the modding community is and the endless possibilities it provides to the gameplay experience. a definite buy!!! fun, fun, fun!",104.2
"this is a great game.... get it and play it. do it now. i am only writing this to fullfil the review requirement of the steam thing... it is a great game though.",223.1
"timeless game. you could probably have over 700 unique hours of gameplay.",86.7
"well... if your girlfriend / boyfriend dumped you... start this game ! lol ! you will be trapped in an amazing game ! and if you google skyrim mods.. well you can play this game for at least a good month (non stop of course !!). a nolifes dream comes true...",141.9
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"one of the best games ive had the chance the play with nearly endless possibilities regarding your faction / quests / mods and even more. an open world that gives you the chance to play your way and do whatever you feel like doing. im never gonna get tired of skyrim, too many possibilities and quests.",261.9
"if you like going where you want when you want and free of wielding any medieval weapons without class restrictions, this game is for you. ive played elder scrolls since daggerfall and the team did a great job with the combat and dialogue aspects. the levelling in skyrim is simple and very logical. you have to play twice this game at least, but i wont say why :)",565.5
"this game is awesome, only thing im really annoyed about is not the game, but steam itself. i bought it yesterday for 40 blimen dollars, and now its on sale for about 12 bucks, its ridoucouless, but its the way of life and i shouldve been patient on my part. i still recoommend this game to everyone interested in a free-roam hack n slash type game.",65.4
"vedy good game and vedy big. addictive but gets boring after a while because theres simply so much to explore. hopefully in the next elder scrolls the leveling system will be alot tougher so you dont get bored by completing a quarter of the quests and being level 70 odd",297.2
"this game is one of my top 10 favorite games. the elder scrolls has always been a fantastic series and this game is no different. the graphics are completely breathtaking, the gameplay is refreshing and fun, and the story (along with all of the side stories) are fantastic. i rate this game a 9.5/10. if you havent played it, i suggest you give it a try!",22.0

"still finding new stuff in this game even now. just buy it.",60.1
"game with many possibilities, 9/10 . basic version of the game is good rpg with huge open world and many things to do ( well, too many sometimes, it can be boring after a while ), but with mods we can changed literally everything, and i mean trully everything. new items, new quests, improves graphics, improves every aspect of the game itself - basically new everything. and all of this works quite simple and without any problems - also i recommended using nexus manager, it could be harder first, but trust me - its very easy to use and with it we could install hundreds of huge mods.",202.0
"amazing. simply amazing. not only when you get done, but from the start. amazing.",60.1
"my second favorite game ever especieally when modded =)",164.0
"shouting at watermelons isnt the only aspect of this game. seeing how far you can assassinate a guard from without getting caught isnt either. a very indepth storyline, amazing graphics,magic powers, and stupid people are.",18.1
"you can play this game over and over again trying different builds (though i mostly end up being a sneaky archer and swords man). this game never gets boring, and if it does somehow, theres a ton of addons and mods you can choose from (my personal favourite in terms of user mods: helgen reborn). over all this game will fill many hours, as long as you fully play it (meaning not just rushing the main quest). there are many nice side quests that are often better then the main quest (the thives guild quest imo for example). the dlcs dragonborn (having started the elder scrolls with morrowind, i especially enjoyed dragonborn) and dawnguard add to the many quests and play time. a great game!",153.3
"this game is very enjoyable if you like rpgs and a rich story. i have played many hours on it. there are a few mission bugs that do sour my game experience but not enough for me to stop playing. its an amazing game. highly recommended.",185.6

"very fun game. here is a quick list of pros and cons. pros ~unique talent system (at least to my experience) ~a lot of dialogue, lets you have an rpg-friendly gaming experience ~fast travel; you dont have to spend countless hours traveling from point a to point b ~addicting character customization cons ~repetative quests; go halfway across skyrim, kill or retrieve something, travel back to turn in ~boring combat system ~too many dragons lol",69.2

"one of my favorite rpg open world fantasy games! world is really big and just fantastic. i love the style and gameplay of this game. quests are really fun and you are never bored while playing. i really like the style of playing because you can play as warrior or wizard style. also there are skills/levels for character which you decide which one to upgrade. world is huge! fantasy level is normal because you can kill also normal warriors/people instead only monsters/dragons. story line is really sick! only the problem is on start of game because you need to walk a lot but later when you discover all the places and towns then you can use fast travel option. game also have a lot of side quests and hiden places to complete and discover especially if you buy legendary edition of the game then you have a lot of new quests. like i said, its one of the best rpg games so i reccommend this game to all rpg and fantasy lovers. game it totally worth of money! 9,5/10",74.2

"the epic atmosphere that wraps this chapter of the tes saga is stunning, allowing the player to dive into a magic world on the edge of a crysis felt never before. the gameplay is quite simplified compared to the previous chapters, nonetheless it still gives a special insight into the fantastic lore of the elder scrolls. 10/10",292.8
"i hit a mammoth and it flew 100 feet in the air. 10/10 would play again.",0.6
"there is probably not much to add to the massive accretion of skyrim opinion, but ill give it a go anyway. i have probably in excess of 200 hours sunk into this game and i still enjoy it. many of you certainly have two, three, four times that many hours in it. people love it, and those who dont usually love to hate it. my guess is not that many people are completely indifferent to skyrim unless they just dont play video games at all. its just another bethesda game in some ways, but its the best one theyve ever made. there have been mods for other games theyve made, but the skyrim mod community is probably one of the most lively that any game has ever inspired. even so (and many will disagree), skyrims a great game even without mods. im intrigued to see what bethesda will do next. eso holds no sway over me, but fallout and skyrim have me wishing for the next big bethesda rpg, and they might just keep me occupied until it surfaces.",56.3
"one of the immersive rpgs i have ever played, i instantly fell in love with the graphics, infinite playability and the massive amounts of mods for quests and lore friendly material. if you have a couple hundred hours to burn and want to be sent back 1000 years this one is for you!",189.5

"so far im really enjoying it. the story is immersive, and i honestly feel like an adventurer when im slaying enemies in cold blood and stealing their loot. do be careful with the workshop, and dont have too many mods activated at the same time.",43.8
"ive put more hours into this game than any other, the breadth of content avaliable thanks to the massive modding comunity is skyrims greatest strength. if you play this game with vanilla settings then it doesnt hold up and you can see that its showing its age, however with a wealth of readly avalibale mods you can create on of the best looking games on the market, tailored exactly to your tastes and if you find any of the mechanics of the game are substandard you can be sure someone has modified it to be to your standards. the game however is plagued by crashes and freezing issues with some of the mods either helping to stop them or causing them in the first place. its a huge issue and a decent debugging tool is noticably absent which makes pinpointing issues a herculean task. with hours of work and following multiple guides you can get a stable and beautiful looking game unmodified this game should get a solid 7/10 a fully modded games will surely get a 9/10 from anyone who is willing to put in all the hours of tweaking",379.3
"excellent game overall as positives outweigh the negatives good points: fantastic visuals, breath taking views of the landscape. missions in dungeons are thrilling lots of replayability well written out lore feels almost like a sim rpg bad points: stale dialogue missions can get boring overtime rather glitchy",50.9
"this is a cool game there is dragons and magic and swords and everything.",312.5
"well, ill need to start with the bad things... skyrim has one of the worst combat mechanics ive seen, a pretty nice amount of bugs, many boring repetitive quests and not-so-spectacular main story... but... what it has can outshine those things... it has stunning visuals, a vast and beautifully thought-out world, nice characters and soo much content (and thats actually excluding all the mods) for your moneys worth... well, im usually not the person who will recommend the game with all those bad things, especially over because of nice visuals, but this game just wants you to play it... it will usually suck you in, and wont let you go, and i guess thats the most important thing...",19.3

"the epicness of slaying a dragon that can kill you in one blow.",371.3
"an amazing rpg! bethesda really did a good job on skyrim. i love open world games and skyrim did not fail me. the fact that you can fight dragons is awesome and how you can gain their soul for unlocking shouts was a cool idea from bethesda. the weapons were also a blast to play with. the amount of weapons and armor you can enchant really made the game fun and how you can use magic spells instead of using a sword or a mace really changed the way you played the game. if you wanted to go for a long range weapon, you could pick a bow and arrow to take out your enemies, or if you are more of the stealth type, a dagger would be a excellent weapon for you. this game is also amazing because it looks beautiful! with the high resolution texture pack, it makes your dovahkiin sexier than ever. when you play skyrim, you never know what to expect and what random loot you will find. i am the dragonborn wearing a hat with badass horns! im dovahakiin known globally youre nobody at all!",305.2
"you dont even need to see this. youve already made up your mind about this game. admit it. fine, i suppose ill make a review. so, skyrim. not many games like this, since theres steps from breathing fire onto a dragon and cooking a soup. huh. so, its the 5th in the franchise of games ive never played, and i must admit. i really really like it. its pretty. good. yeah. recommended. gameplay mechanics. waving a sword in a enemies face waiting for them to bleed tomato juice. fabulous. or for them to get smashed in the back of the head by a bear. always nice.",360.6
"its almost ludicrous to write this. if you are reading this right now, wondering, hmm, should i buy this game? than you really need to get out of that rock youre under. this is the game of the year. this game provides countless hours of gameplay, along the path you want to take. its enthralling, every part of it, from the main quest, to the side quests to the enviroment, which feels as if it were living and breathing. if youre still reading this, just buy the game. you wont regret it.",125.4

"epic role play game with tons of bugs and outdated system. i still cant figure that out why this game is so popular (even among normal players), because with those defects, this game should only be a fans-only game. the only perfect part that i cant complain about is the scenes. i believe there are no game scenes can be more immersive than skyrim. recommend to any the elder scrolls fans, rpg maniacs, modders and players who interested in making a perfect rpg by adding mods to a semi-finished rubbish.",241.3

"only downside to this game is no multiplayer (i just want 1-4 player local co op to play with friends, not the entire community *teso*). also a linux port would have been great to have. oh skyrim... definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. if you dont like the default fighting mechanics stop complaining and get a mod. dont like graphics? get a mod. get a mod is my answer to almost everything when someone says something about skyrim because the mods allow you to make it yours.",90.3

"absolutely amazing. can spend a lot of time in this game and never get bored with it. especially with all the downloadable mods.",49.7
"skyrim is a beautiful, gigantic world full of diverse towns, dwemer ruin labyrinths, dragon lairs, and ancient tombs. almost every location feels unique and hand-made, filled with tiny details and nuances. however, everything else is a letdown. stripped of stats, the only enchantments you can put on equipment (or stats on found equip) are elemental damage/resistance, damage/skill boosts, or stat drains/boosts. magic and skills are very shallow and have zero scaling, resulting in mages being underpowered late game while meleers kill everything in 2 hits on the hardest difficulty. the games best aspect, exploration, soon becomes unrewarding when you can craft & enchant better equip than can be found anywhere. the main questline, which will take you about 40 hours, is your typical you are the chosen one story (but still has some memorable moments given how much traveling you do). sadly, skyrims world is trapped in a mediocre, dumbed down, dx9 console port.",89.1
"this game is absolutly brilliant i recomend to anyone that has a sense of adventure. this game ratedd 10/10",138.8
"i recommend skyrim because its one of my all-time favourite games. i really love the open world element to the game. add that along with your ability to master just about any skill makes it a great intro to rpg games. the game can seem complex at times, but its easy to learn. you can role with tons of different builds, making every playthrough unique. the dlc only adds so much more. the game is so broad, that the vanilla gameplay alone can add up 500+ hours. include the workshop content into this wonderful game, and you have another several hundred. theres also a huge nexusmods community. if youve got the money, definitely put it into the elder scrolls v: skyrim. you wont regret it.",144.2
"an unforgetable adventure and by far the best adventure rpg ive ever played. my favorite es game",80.2
"boring as heck. huge world and lots of walking around with fetch quests. combat is so simplistic, hold the triggers and thats it. same boring monsters. dungeons with 2-3 mobs and thats it. what a snooze fest. cant believe how overrated this game is. these open ended games are getting too massive for their own good. spent more time getting to destination than playing the game. thumbs down. dragon age a ton better.",12.0
"skyrim had me for a loop the first time i played and at first i didnt quite understand the game. this was back when i first started playing on the xbox 360. now! i love the game to death and it takes its place on my throne room as the most immersive, adventurous, badass game i have ever placed my paws on. this game takes everything that previous adventure rpg games have done right and made massive improvements on them. the game is purely amazing! the only criticism that i can give is the ability to get stuck on objects from time to time. this can become a bit annoying when your trying to platform from place to place and you end up stuck between a rock and well...a rock. regardless of this issue the game holds up strong to its reputation and continues to be a powerhouse. i can only be hopeful that the elder scrolls online is as amazing as its predicessor.",207.0
"dragons, destiny, dungeons, and drauger. a massive, immensely immersive world. fully upgradeable, moddable, configurable. and most important of all, the cake is not a lie, not in skyrim. this is easily one of the best games i have ever played, and i consider it one of the great games for the ages.",515.4
"worth plenty of money. a bit bland. lots of content. but you must play with mods. they make it a truly great game.",146.5
"wonderful game, if a bit buggy and filled plot farts. on the plus, its fun and gives a sense of thrill to adventure out into the open world, fight monsters, get treasure, the choice help people or hurt them... its quite the experience and i always enjoy every minute i put into this game. on the down side, underdeveloped plot in some areas, especially in side quests, left me wanting more out of it all. the textures can be blotchy at best sometimes, and sometimes the game is just downright broken. despite the major hurdles -which we all know most elder scrolls games are fixer uppers in the end- its still an amazing adventure, and being a es fan since morrowind, i am proud to say this game is worth your time and money. ive spent hundreds of hours on the xbox360 verison. c:",98.3
"this is a review you can trust, do not listen to any other review besides this. as you can probably see, i have played this game for 275+ hours, and i still have not done everthing there is to do in the game, not including mods. the game is full of rich content that still blows me away. yes, the graphics may be a little outdated but the game is from 2011. if you are wondering if you should buy this game, do it. the game is almost endless, and if you do get bored of the game once in a great while, then just download a mod and it will make the game exciting again. if i were to rate this game i would have to rate it a 9.4 out of 10. this is not a 10 out of 10 because of the bugs and glitches, sometimes you have no idea what to do next, the graphics are a bit outdated, and when you beat the game you can get a bit bored (until you download mods).",302.2

"compared to oblivion this game isnt as good. skyrim you would think being the latest open world installment in the series would be the most unlinear, unpredicting, and most rewarding yet. sadly it falls short of those three aspects! the game puts you down the same path over and over, the battles are actually boring, the loot has no real feeling anymore. i feel like everytime i play i get bored very quickly, even with mods this game just does not feel like es. the elves now look like aliens... argonians look less like lizardmen and more like something you would find as an enemy in a swampland. i bet half of the people that have played this game didnt even realize there is a civil war going on! morrowind, oblivion, play those.",279.4

"the elder scrolls v: skrim still never ceases to amaze me i higly recomend this game to anyone who is looking for an adventure or who wants to hunt and murrder all those before them. i would give this game a 97 out of 100 due to the graphics not being the best for a game made in 2011 but however what this game lacks in graphics makes up for in gamplay. this game is the kind of game that will draw you in for hours and every part of the massive map is detailed and will make you want to explore it and find the secrets and treasures that come with the doungens and villages that you will explore. so far i have put hundreds of hour into this game on the xbox-360 and now that i have played it on the pc it still amazes me the stunning detail tamerial has to offer its players.",89.2
"the game is just ok. this game has so many bugs in it its ridiculous. this is the only game i know of where if i am looking at its wikipedia site, i specifically go to the bug section to see if what happened or what i want to do is a bug or not. i told myself id beat this game when i started(not just the main questline but all quests) and im close enough to completion (non dlc) that im done. i felt that i was bored throughout the whole 100+ hours it took me to complete it. i would tell myself just keep going and get it over with so i can move onto the next game i tried mods but it didnt make it any better(except for skyui)",119.7

"what can be said about skyrim that hasnt already been said? in short, prepare to be sucked into a world that will quickly consume your time and keep your attention in the vast world that is skyrim. the game, coupled with the extensive steam workshop is more than enough to keep an intrepid adventurer busy for many weeks and months to complete every quest. in a day where games at retail price are not value for money due to how quick they can be completed - skyrim delivers.",76.6

"the elder scrolls v has such a beautiful world that rewards you for exploring, with lots of interesting quests and loot to be had. the combat doesnt have much depth, but is still fun. (especially if youre a mage!!) environments can be beautiful, but textures, shading, and mesh quality are all lacking. it also lacks the complexity of the older elder scrolls games, a trend of the past few in the series, but it is still an amazing experience. but dont forget the mods! mods can make the game so much better, both mechanically and graphically. even without mods, though, it is an incredible game that will suck up tons of your time.",195.6
"this game is great by itself, but for the glorious pc master race enthusiast, the many mods available make this game even better.",33.3
"best game ever ! this was my first elder scroll game and from the very beginning i love it ! the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is great, but the best part of skyrim is the inmersion ! you can do whatever you want, be the main story or the sidequest, you will always have something to do. you can spend all day and not get bored in this game. the dlc are nice additions, although you already have enough content with the main game by itself. and if by any chance you get bored, theres always the mods community making news stuff ! when i cracked this game i liked this game so much that i bought it because its a masterpiece. its that good. seriously, stop reading this and go buy it and play it :) !",60.6

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim comes with the same minor, but frequent glitches that players of the previous the elder scrolls games have seen, but those cons can certainly negligible with the overall experience it provides. the sheer beauty and design of the world sucks the player in, and truly grants the feeling of being part of skyrim. the music is fantastic, and the combat and animations are better than ever. the near complete freedom of exploring easily gives a really lengthy playtime, and surely is worth the price of the game, if not more. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the few games that i actually look forward to dlcs and wish to see what more the world of skyrim can offer. hunting dragons have never been as epic.",343.5

"this game is great, but has its drawbacks. it feels more like an adventure game than an rpg, its more about doing than filling out level sheets. which i must say i prefer. i found it tedious in oblivion to allocate skills into things i ended up not using because i didnt know the plot of the game the first time. it didnt feel like i was playing a game, it felt like homework. skyrim is simplier, but its streamlined nature is what makes it so enjoyable to play. i feel like im going on an adventure, and getting stronger using skills that come natural to me. the characters look pretty, and the open world is really quite astounding. i found myself simply looking at the scenery, knowing that someone had to envision it. it is probably one of my favorite games, but i dont like to compare it to the other elder scrolls games, because it breaks the mold with a new leveling system.",74.7
"it is indeed a good day for high adventure, but lets cut to the chase. dont buy it...yet. its a remarkable game, but the community will be getting tools in january that the devs use so the mod community will produce some truly genius additions. the 1.2 patch has bugged all the dragons and magic resistances, with hopefully a fix next week, as dragons are the topic of the day in skyrim. on the shiny flip side of this coin though, it may well be the only rpg youll ever need. if you rate fallout 3 as one of your favourite games, you owe it to yourself to try it. its more streamlined and varied than oblivion, making it a delicious combo of the 2. quests are easier to navigate and the variation in play style is remarkable. youre rewarded for your particular play style and the adventure suits whatever style you desire. my wizard has morphed into a sneaky wizard warrior with a springle of assassin and is alot of fun to play. longer review to come, but outta space :)",116.1
"its skyrim......if you loved oblivion, morrowind, then you will love skyrim. if you have never played any of the bethesda titles, be prepared for a submersion into a world beyond imagining, with lots of history and a future you are destined to be a part of. enjoy playingthe hero going it alone or with companions. master magic, martial, and other skills which will aid you to explore and fullfill your destiny as the dragonborn. all additional content is great and you can add mods to the main program to further improve or even alter your gaming experience. i highly rommend the dragonborn hideout.... but hey thats me..... anyway hope you enjoy the game :)",435.2

"bethesda has done it again with another success, graphics, gameplay, leveling up, dragons, a nerds best dream but also a gamers dream, they got everything that was good with fallout and oblivion and ll the other games and crammed them together without stuffing it up at all as there is a good balance between weapons you dont really find level 1 swords when your a level 60 which i love and the dagon shouts just add a new strategy in combat with fusrodah or the blink ability from dishonoured just for you to use in that tricky dungeon the puzzles are a bit of a challenge but not much and the pc version just does it right, mods, graphics, loading times, everything. im rating it 10/10",10.7
"i am forever a fan of this franchise. i never played the previous games, but jumping right into this one, i was immediately immersed in the world. the mods available today, even without enb, make the game look like it was released just yesterday. performance friendly mods even exist. the game always has something to do and if you enjoy exploring and enjoying the world in which you are emersed and having a free scneario to do anything you please, this game always delivers, and the franchise will go down as one of my all time favorites.",649.7

"if you dont own this game then you have issues... unless you dont own it for fear of losing your real life to it. this game has infinite content, awesome characters, endless things to find, and fun gameplay with a wide range of difficulties. this game doesnt take itself too seriously and the setting of skyrim is awesome. slaying dragons, fighting in huge battles, and raiding temples and tombs is endlessly entertaining and you constantly feel that you are buildingyour character even 20 hours after youve beaten every god damn main story quest and dlc. the graphics and music are beautiful as well! this game does have tons of little bugs and glitches, but considering the scope and size of this game, it doesnt matter one bit. skyrim is a great way to lose 40 hours of your life.",66.2
"skyrim has one of the best graphics of the games fron 2011 in my opinion. this game is not like the most games. you dont have to follow the mainstory, you can do other quests if you want, you can make yourself stronger. its up to you what you do with your character. i really like that. its refreshing. there is so much to do in this game, many choices. you can become the great hero, a very skilled thief, an assassin, you can become the greatest warrior and you can even marry someone. i would recommend this, just because of the nice landscape and the stories.",419.2

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is another great addition to the serie. it is everything a fan would expect. the story is incredible, the lenght of the game is awesome, you have plenty side-missions and you are left with a lot of different ways to play the game. the 2 main problems why this game doesnt deserve a 10 are the fact that the graphics are way out-dated, they look just like oblivion. it sucks that games nowadays are stuck having to develop with 5yo consoles. i think they shouldve done what bf3 did which is make the game on pc with ultra graphs possibilities and release an xbox/ps3 version which can run only at medium graphs. the second thing is the skill tree really isnt computer friendly, we can clearly see that it was made for console and it sucks. of course theres also a few minor bugs, but nothing that will ruin your gaming experience. overall this is a must buy for any rpg fans and even for people who never played any elder scrolls!",18.7
"oh, skyrim. what a great experience. you start playing this game and you will never complete it. you will continue returining to skyrim many times. you will spend countless hours exploring, hunting, killing bandits, and many other cool things. add mods to the mix and you can customize and enhace the core game towards the perfect rpg. if youre a true gamer, you should never live without missing this one.",100.3

"i have been playing the elder scrolls v: skyrim for almost two years, thanks to my sister who introduced it to me. as a begining gamer, i would like to make known that i dont like this game for the popularity it has gained, but for the experiences i have had with it. the elder scrolls v: skyrim has always fascinated me with the increasingly complicated storylines that always seem to tie together, and how you can see it effects the gaming realm you live in. for example, during the game, the people are dearly afraid of some sort of prophesy that claims to be the harbingers of the end times, as one guard puts it after one of your first dragon encounters. in these end times, you watch how the civil war rages on, how your encounter with alduin changes everything, and so forth. mainly, i recommend this game because of the intense graphics, the beautiful landscapes you can discover above and below ground, and especially the strange artificats you find throughout your journeys. i recommend this game for people who want the adventures of delving into ruins without leaving their computers, or the ones, like me, who have trouble commiting to a goal and just seem to want to wonder through the land searching for artifacts and more beautiful landscapes to gasp in awe at.",14.3

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"rather than writing a regular review, lets go with a first impressions and ill extend this review once i get further into the game. so i spent almost 2 hours playing the game, so this is more or less just a first impression. anyway i played a lot of fallout 3 and oblivion, one beeing the previous gane in the series, the other being from the same developer, there are similarities, but also improvements above those games. that being said, there are several years between the games, so its understandable that skyrim looks better and is better optimized. there is the same problems that were present in tes iv and fallout 3, the combat is not great from the 1st person view (especially with melee weapons). the 3rd person view is not great out of box. the game looks great (even without mods), the voiceacting is much better, basically anything can be moded in the game. as i said this is a first impression, but so far the game is very good.",21.4
"this might possibly be one of the greatest rpgs of all time. i would buy this in a heartbeat and im sure some of you agree. this game will always be remembered. the modding community has kept this game alive and still going strong for nearly five years. if you want an open world rpg thats immersive, has an amazing soundtrack, and want to be lost in the large amounts of lore this series has to offer, get it. its the game for you. you can also expand your experience with the dlcs. unlike its console ports, tesv features an unprecidented amount of mods that can add hours and hours to the total play time. i took a moment on plenty of occassions to take in the views from throat of the world. its on of the only games that has a truly beatiful (and mod-able) skybox, with stars and moons giving light at night, along with nice shadows cast in the trees down in falkreath. i also killed braith, hiding her body on a building (hiding) 10/10- like far cry 3 with bows -ign",29.7
"this game is amazing. very well orchestrated music accompanied by beautiful graphics makes this game the best fantasy adventure i have played ever. the gameplay is slow and gritty, with three main classes: thief, mage, and warrior, all equally fun. the variety between one thing to the other is immense because of subtlety. for example, weapons ranks are based on their material, and every material makes the weapon change but not by too much, making it more realistic, although there could have been more variety in these weapons. there was one side-quest which the key item was a sword, there were books on this and to get this started i was pumped, but to my dismay it was a regular shape. there are few varieties in crafted weapons, which is my only negative comment, other than the occasional glitch. i give the elder scrolls v: skyrim a 9/10",116.8
"i wouldnt have expected any less from the elder scrolls series. its a great game that has a little something for everyone. the sole thing i didnt enjoy as much as i did in oblivion is that the game turned into more of a dungeons and dragons type thing as for the better part of the game thats all you seem to be doing. luckily, the daedric quests are great fun and provide a bit of much needed variety.",2.4

"when i first played skyrim it was on the ps3, by far i would recomend it to any one to play much better on pc why, well simple mods better gaming experience sounds,graphics, ooooohhh and dont get me wrong yes u can cheat but  cheating and that console  it just ruins the game the story the movie.. any ways skyrim on pc play very much i recomend it.....",556.3

"elder scrolls skyrim... probably one of the most anticipated titles in a long time... everyone wanted a peice of this game.. it spawned numerous internet memes but all of that aside, its truely a great great game. the graphics are breathtaking, the combat is amazingly indepth and fun, the quests and storylines are moving and incorperate you in ways you didnt think possible. i could go on for hours about the gameplay but there are thousands of reviews about how great this game is... ill sum it all up on one sentance for you. bethesda has done it again... its just amazing, you must play this game. (fps / rpg / adventure)",151.7
"this game is getting old now but its still fun to play",540.6
"awesome game. 10/10 amazing gameplay, fun resources and endless opportunities",98.1
"this game is very awesome and fun. but, you can steal things and kill random people. its like you really play as your character because you can go on quests, buy a house, get married, adopt children, things like that. you can be good and help people, give people money, you can even rescue certain people from dieing. you can also be bad and join the dark brotherhood (a group of assassins) and the thieves guild. you can pick peoples pockets for money or valuables or steal from thier houses. their is also a war campaign. you can join the stormcloak rebellion and fight for worship of talos, a nord god, or join the empire and fight the stormcloaks to stop worship of talos. its fantasy, so no guns no grenades nothing like that. instead its all swords, axes, armor and best of all magic! its fun, but hard and if you are a younger player, dont get it. too many bad rolemodels. but some positive ones. but its my favorite game!!!",212.2
"visually dissapointing. however is fantastic with mods, most of which are available from steam workshop.",20.0
"9.4/10 skyrim, this, i can truthfully say, is onle of the best games i have ever played. the immersive feel of whenever youre trying to bow down enemies of your guild with a bow, the role playing of drinking beer i n a bar, the fear that you feel when you see a troll. all of these factors make skyrim my favorite rpg. the sheer quantity of things you can do, the ways you can play, you way you can look! when you play skyrim, you feel like youre really choosing your own path, more than just an alternate ending, or a certian team. you choose what you do; and how you do it. ive never played a game like it, you really get to know it well, get in to routines, without it ever seeming repetitive, you just enjoy knowing where to run, or how to hide. even when you do get to know skyrim, complete the quests, max out your skills. you introduce yourself to the vast modding comunity, both on the nexus and on the workshop, you can get so many different types of mods, being able to see that dragons wing in more quality, or adding a whole new hold on a far away island, you never run out of mods to explore. these things are what add to why skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time, a must buy for and roleplayer, explorer or combat-lover",79.3
"i have played skyrim for approxiamately 80 hours. i would recommend this game to anyone who likes rpg and open world games. the main story quests are not that interesting but add flavor to the game. the side quests are engaging, a good idea for powerful items, thrilling, and most importantly enjoyable. most addons for the game are exciting and add something to the game. i would download skyrim skse if you plan are using more than only two three addons. some of the graphics through out the realm are bad unless you get an addon for that specific graphic. some of the spells are interesting but other have no purpose. choose wisely i would say. there are a few glitches but they are minor that i have seen. over all i love it.",57.1
"skyrim is a fun game and it is for consil and computer",72.5

"the xbox ones graphics really do this game justice. the graphics are really good. i would highly recommend it.",4.2

"best of the best. very interesting storyline , tons of quests , tons of fun , dragons , trolls , magic , chickens .. the only single player game where you can spend 1000+ hours and have unlimited fun . community is great and support this game by unofficial patches and bugfixes. if you feel bored you can download mods and have even more fun , there are 1000 of mods for this game . 10/10 , buy this game and support the developers.",279.0

"i dont easily get stuck to games, skyrim though, the moment i started playing, i was stuck. and not for just a week or two, i played this game everyday for several months, always finding new things to explore or quests to master. sure, there are minimal bugs at times, but none of them makes the game crash or deleted my save files. if something, they can even be rather funny at times! simply, fantastic game. if you are looking for a real gaming experience, this is the game for you.",56.1
"a great open world game, but begins to lose its charm after playing long enough. really holds its replayability in the massive modding community on the nexus. the vanilla game could use a lot of work on storytelling and character development, and has trouble finding truth to the claim of being an rpg. would definitely recommend buying for the gameplay, massively detailed open world, and modding capability.",87.1
"i launched this for 2nd time thinking of completing 2 more missions, and then i played it 13 hours without any break. 10/10",52.1
"a very fun game that fully immerses you into a prodigious world i have yet to find the end of. there are so many places to explore and complete. i havent progressed much in the main storyline due to an extreme interest in the plethora of sidequests that better explain the world, bring to life the characters, and strengthen my own i would highly recommend to those who like adventure, fights, role playing, and long, immersive hours of gameplay",59.1

"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",71.8
"day one of skyrim on pc: this is pretty good. cant wait to tell my friends about it. day two of skyrim on pc: ah look! mods! ill only use a few. day three of skyrim on pc: 150 mods for graphics isnt enough i need more. here we go killable children. thatll do nicely. day four of skyrim on pc: i have adopted child slaves fighting dragons in a battle arena. another one dead. back to the orphanage. day five of skyrim on pc: we dont have any more children for you to adopt. player.additem 64b33 1500. u wot m8. day six of skyrim on pc: this is getting out of control, im going to make a new save. repeat...",33.7

"skyrim is one of the greatest games of its generation, just like its predecesssors morrowind and oblivion were. skyrim is expansive, immersive, and fun. while the game certainly has its bugs and shortcomings (the graphics could have been better) it remains one of the most enjoyable games availble. skyrim also has a very large and talented modding community which serves to further extend its gameplay potentintial.",236.0
"i would recommend any elder scrolls game to any gamer. it has nothing to do with visuals, tho skyrim keeps up the beautiful visuals and artistic diversity of the series. this, like its predecessors, has a huge amount of replay value built-in, with unlimited skill combinations, a mind-boggling amount of places to discover and explore, and countless quests, even without bethesdas top-notch dlc. factor in all the free content from the mod community, and an elder scrolls game can entertain for years.",681.4
"completely lives up to the hype, and beyond. a gorgeous love child of fallout 3 and oblivion, the world is massive, believable, and intricately detailed. even at $60, its worth every cent. this game pulls you in and spits you out a week later, leaving you wondering where the time went. and then you remember: you spent it in skyrim. also: horses.",68.5
"probably one of the best all around rpgs as far as im concerned, the story line is awesome and what really sets this apart is how in detail you can choose the path of your character.",4.6

"theres a huge world to explore just past the 29.99 fee",97.0
"the best rpg i have ever played and could possibly be the best over all game i have ever played and that is saying alot since i have played alot of games. it is a must buy for any one and a great deal for $30. the edition to mods makes it such a even greater experience too. i have the game running ultra with 56 graphic enhancing mods and so story, armor/weapon, skin mods too. with the graphic mods it looks fantastic and even with out it looks great. the music, story, graphics, gameplay, and really every thing is awesome. just buy it.",37.2

(also, i have over 40 hours on this game but i guess my offline time doesnt add to my profile?)",102.4

"scream n shout simulator 10/10, would shout again",27.8
"if you do not own this game already im afraid i cant tell you more than: go and buy the freaking thing. enormous immersive world, enjoyable plot, extensive character creation, very deep and fairly detailed backstory and dragons to boot. all of this sums it up nicely why you should stop reading this now and start shouting some mudcrabs to death. i would rate this to be as nice smelling as a warm pizza with your favourite toppings.",128.8
"great game. very intriguiging story plot. good game for people who like magic, swords, and story. tons of side-quests as well that make the game very fun and almost endless. nice music soundtrack also sets the mood. i suggest playing with the volume up high and probably at night so you wont be disturbed. its very annoying to be bothered while playing this kind of game. overall great game. my scoring would be a 9.5",167.9

"i had this game on my playstation for a while. eventually i had the guts the start the game up, knowing the glitches and all thinking the game would suck major balls. was i ever this wrong? no, never. this is the best open world rpg ive ever played. the glitches can be annoying, yes, but the game was amazing and it never ends ever! eventually i bought it on the pc and did a fast run, took me only 15 hours. this game will keep you interested for a long time. there are so many quests, there are quests within quests! after one questline thinking i wouldnt find something else to do, something else pops up. some questlines i thought would be boring as hell! eventually these questlines get interesting. so many items to get, so many achievements! there are even the 16 daedric artifacts to collect. get this game. you will not regret it.",60.2

"incredible rpg. the gameplay lacks very little, if not nothing. the plot is great, with enough quests to last a year, and enough dlc and mods to last a lifetime. if you like rpgs, or any sort of fantasy actionadventure game, get this. low on money? buy it for less the 5 dollars during a steam sale.",78.4

"this is one of the buggiest, most broken, most unfinished-feeling games i have seen in a long time. it would take a very special game to make me look past all the (really glaring) issues and still have fun, and skyrim is one of those games. it captures the feeling of adventure, of exploration, of excitement over the smallest things, more than most any games ive ever played. wouldnt call it a masterpiece, but its most definitely worth your time and money. (plus the game is extremely moddable, so youre getting a potentially limitless amount of playthroughs without it feeling stale, not even mentioning the entirely new games people have made with the engine. bumps up the value quite considerably, in my opinion.)",144.1

"what can possiblly be said? this is by far the best elder scrolls game yet. many of the more annoying features from previous games(i.e. rapid transport, poor waypoint systems) were finally addressed with skyrim. while the game is hardly perfect, character for example are still very 2-dimensional and shallow regardless of how important they are supposed to be, overall the game is an excellent play, made all the better by a steller mod community and the presence of the dragons.",349.0

"what can i say, its the elder scrolls! if you liked the previous in the series chances are you are gonna like this too. this is set in the nordic style region of skyrim, a bitter, cold and harsh climate full of quests and killing bad guys just cos. some might rant about its flaws but no game is perfect and as it goes this is pretty good. you can determine the outcome of a civil war by picking sides, there are many other side quests to take part in as well as marrying and owning property, lots of caves and places to explore not to mention the main quest line. a large amount of playtime if you wish to do the main and side quests and even more play time if you want to explore everything and find little easter eggs and things. the graphics unmodded are now a bit dated but still quite stunning and there are some great mods available for the game. i had this originally for xbox with no dlc but saw it was on sale on steam so brought the legendary edition and gave my xbox copy away.",80.2
"this is a spactacular game that never fails to keep me on my toes, as even when adventuring, you can get all kinds of messages from people, daedra, and all other sorts of things can happen. not to mention the mods! the mods play a huge part in making this game 60x better than its huge amount of awesomeness was! i highly reccomend this game!",237.8

"i am finding it hard to put into words just how impressive the elder scrolls v: skyrim is. i will try to be succinct. the game world and rendering engine is absolutely beautiful. the most common screenshot i take is simply of the awe-inspiring vistas found throughout the world. the world is also incredibly atmospheric - while wandering the frozen wastes around winterhold, ive never felt so alone in a computer game. combat and magick are similar to what weve seen in past tes games, but skyrim comes with a few new pros. there are a few cut-scene-style execution kills; instead of a straight 1-100 scale, you can now take perks which improve your abilities in various ways. this is a good addition, but some of the perks need to be re-scaled. skyrim has expanded what it means to be a role-playing game in the modern era. the world is livelier than ever, and you can do things like sit in an inn and listen to a bard sing; get married (not just a 10-second erotic cutscene!);",600.3

"even at 354 hours ( at the time or writing ), i can safely say i have not completed the game. there is just so much content with the game that you can multiple playthroughs and never end up the same way. after you beat the main quest there is still so much to do that it doesnt feel like the game ended. it takes after oblivion in the sense that you can dedicate a lot of time into one guild, whether it be thieves, dark brotherhood, or the champions, or just focus on the main quest and have a race with a friend to see who can finish first. i personally would recommend this to anyone with a powerful enough computer, one that is about three years old should be able to handle it. the quests can pile up and seem overwhelming with the amount to do at times, but other than that pesky nuisance it is almost perfect to anyone looking for an open world adventure of a lifetime",388.2

"one of the best games ive ever played! you can put so many hours into this game without knowing. i recomend just starting off with no dlc or mods until you feel you know enough about the game (not story wise, but gameplay wise, because some mods can affect it). as for dlc, i would get dawnguard and work through that, then get dragonborn because dragonborn can mess things up a little (i may have killed all of riverwood because of some damn cultists). it doesnt really matter when you get hearthfire, but get it as it adds the nice touch of adopting some kids and making a hom for you and your family. enjoy :d (i know you will)",200.1

"if you loved morrowind (like i did) , youll probably be let down by skyrim. skyrim for pc is a console port with clunky, unintuitive, uninformative uis / menus. the voice acting for the hundreds upon hundreds of quests is seemingly done by only two persons. one for men quest givers and one for female quest givers. every person sounds the same as the last. at first glance the game seems wide open. a world to explore and all of that jazz. however, after awhile you start to realize that skyrims world is one huge maze full of caves. where the player is seemingly always running (constricted) down some brick road or another, from point a to point b. brick roads everywhere to guide you on your journey!! dont think about straying from the path because youll run into an intraversable mountain almost instantly. oh and caves... skyrim has alot of caves. they should have called the game cave explorer instead. every cave is very restrictive aswell. youre on a set path, no options... only dead ends to ensure you get back on the correct path. skyrim is but a husk of what morrowind was. kind regards, david",335.3
"ive said this amidst all the hype when it was initially released and ill say it now; its not as good as oblivion. its still great, i love it. the addition of wyverns fills the void of lacking variety in the environment. ive not played the dlc but it allegedly adds a lot. i recommend it.",22.2

"skyrim - simply a masterpiece, initially there were a few bugs to work through and the odd save glitch that can be catastrophic for your game...however this doesnt manage to blemish the most epic single player rpg experience to date. graphics: from the lush waterfalls, the haunted forests of the witches to the snowy mountain peaks, its a beautiful game in its entirety. mods are also available to enhance the default graphics even further. gameplay: magic spells feel great to use, the fling back from a lightning spell when you blast an enemy is great...the summoned creatures also look great. melee/range weapons also feel great to use, as if they were the real thing. sound: voice acting is great, a huge step up from oblivions monotonous boring voices. i didnt find the main song to be as epic compared to oblivions, however that is a matter of personal taste. the rest of the ambient sounds, background music is top notch and really adds to the immersion. overall 9.5/10",107.0
"this game is absolutely astonishing. the amount of detail, time, effort, and emotion that developers have put into this is breathtaking. its full of surprises and easter eggs, and subliminaly tells you more about yourself. 100% worth buying.",43.8

"legendy edition (with all the dlc) is (overall) the best fantasy rpg of all time, and i _love_ fantasy rpgs. the dlc really adds a lot of high-quality content. best played when you have all of the content at the beginning and the whole world just melts together with the dlc and you dont really know what is coming from where.",75.0

"really good game 10/10 good for at least 150 hours of gameplay and then you can start messing around with mods",324.1
"this game... is fun. ive played better, and so have you. about the only thing that stands out for me in this title would be the intuitive crafting system, where its actually worth your time to spend time on it. however, that being said, this game is more of the same crap youve done in every other rpg youve ever played. everything from the go to point a to kill beastie to go to point b and get me a thingy. nothing about this game really screams innovation, and even the voice powers work so much like any other castable ability that it might as well be mandatory spell casting on the par of a quick cast ability in diablo. so i wouldnt suggest anyone spend 30 dollars on this title. you can spend a fraction of that and pick up oblivion, which has far better writing, exponetially better content, and have a game playable to the nth degree. whereas skyrim basically amounts to a graphical update to oblivion (all the tes games since morrowind use the same graphics engine, with upgrades between launches) without all the depth and immersion. so in short, i would not recommend anyone spend more than 20 usd on this title unless they are a die hard tes fan that simply must see the new content.",126.4

"all around amazing, awesome free roam and mechanics.",19.7
"i love elderscrolls since morrowind, but skyrim...just saying, if a game keeps you playing over a hundred hours a week, without getting boring, instead making you more and more interrested and you aint even finished half yet; well then this game youre playing is skyrim.",139.8

"quite possibly my favorite game on my games list, a fantastic addition to any gamer, it adds strategy and a thought process into everything you do. tons of items, areas to explore, and dungeons this game is fantastic. mods merely enhance the game play, the default game is more than entertaining enough with at least 100 hours of gameplay. 9.5/10.",268.7

"a very large fantastic experience, especially if you mods it with great things like brighter water, dragon souls for perks and more armors/weapons from the lotr (etc.)",561.7
"in all likelyhood, you will never run out of things to do in skryim. between the huge open world to explore, the great dlc expansions, and the huge host of content added by the community through mods, skyrim is an experience that is essentially timeless, and endlessly enjoyable. when the legendary edition goes for as low as $13 dollars during the summer sale, youd be insane not to own this game. highly recommend.",104.8

"i used to have friends, then i bought skyrim. 10/10",92.7
"this is one of my top games, i love it, and played through it multiple times, something i dont do often. skyrim has some amazing graphics and the modding community has even taken this further. (assuming you have the pc for it) but its not the graphics that make this game, its the rich and beautiful world full of mythical creatures. while it is true that bethesda has a bit of a reputation for releasing buggy games, the modding community has set that straight with their unofficial skyrim patches. if you are a fan of rpgs or series such as the lord of the rings, or narnia, then i recommend you get this game.",571.4
"wanna waste a month of your life in a shady room, after stocking up on cheap food? boy, are you in for a treat. with this game, youll be able to sit in that bunker of yours (until you play skyrim to the point of boredom and decide to mod it and play for that extra few minutes.) and say goodbye to society.",637.3

"a true rpg - thats what comes to my mind when thinking about skyrim. great, open world. it has its boundaries for sure, but they are so neatly camouflaged by tens of sidequests, hundreds of interesting places to visit... my first playthrough of skyrim... i cant even call it a playthrough. created a character, plunged into the world, and forgot about alduin. after nearly 500 hours of playing i confess to have completed the main story just once. too many amazing things to do/places to see to bother with the story. and mods of course. thats what kept me playing, keeps me playing still. there are great many modifications adding new quests, adventures, npcs, and - its still skyrim. those mods just take the immersion to a whole new level. of course, you need to know which mods to install :) so... keep calm and play skyrim! :whiterun:",485.4

"playing this game on pc, xpotatoe and ps3 and im still not even tired this game! i probably have over 500 hours over the three and by far the pc is superior due to the fact that mods make the most of game 10/10.",66.1
"its fun for 150 hours then it gets pretty much boring; but those hours are worth it. and thank god its not addictive.",224.5
"this game is just as great as it was 3 years ago, and with the contribution of the countless mods on the workshop and nexus, it is still way better than alot of recent games. it has an unlimited replay vaule with loads of different play styles, meaning there will be new stuff to find in every playthrough. 10/10 bring on elder scrolls 6!!!",200.2
"really good game where you can do anything you want. skyrim can keep you playing for hours plus 3 dlc to add more things to do. it also has mods from the steam workshop and other websites that have skyrim mods such as the nexus. my playtime says it all.",1149.7
"skyrim is far from a perfect game, but even with its shortcomings it delivers an astounding amount of entertainment, and alot of replayability. if youve played oblivion, you will instantly be familiar with much of the game, but many enhancements are welcome additions that make the game fresh, like the stat and perk system that removes the old min/max need to train lesser skills on level up to boost stats. if you enjoyed oblivion, you will love this game.",213.6
"this is one of my favorite games. i really enjoy being able to wander around doing odd quests and advancing my level. you can do just about anything you want in this game. you can follow the main storyline or go wherever you would like. there are tons of sidequests to do and plenty to see. i feel like i get my worth from just wandering around and ocasionally going into a cave or dungeon to get some treasure. i first got into the elder scrolls with morrowind and have been hooked since.",54.8
"skyrim is like a music album that has a few tracks that you arent particularly fond of, but rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you cant help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible.",33.7
"i am forever a fan of this franchise. i never played the previous games, but jumping right into this one, i was immediately immersed in the world. the mods available today, even without enb, make the game look like it was released just yesterday. performance friendly mods even exist. the game always has something to do and if you enjoy exploring and enjoying the world in which you are emersed and having a free scneario to do anything you please, this game always delivers, and the franchise will go down as one of my all time favorites.",649.7
"get to character customization screen, spend 70 minutes morphing into different races and genders in town square, quit game 10/10",11.6
"honestly,whats to say about the infamous skyrim. its a huge,open-worlded,modable,nordic first-person rpg. you kill dragons on level 5 and suck their soul out,which is pretty metal. no,but really. its a superb game and you should buy it.",25.5
"first off, i will admit that skyrim is the first elder scrolls game that ive ever played and until now i did not know what i was missing. i first received skyrim as an xmas gift from my fiance for the xbox in 2011. i loved it so much that when i moved to pc gaming, it was a must have game for me. anyways, on to the review: this game has amazing graphics and goes indepth with how you want to play. becoming a werewolf or a vampire have their own perks as well. persuasion, intimidation, assassination, head-to-head combat, poison.. attack the situation how you want to. the story can be a little hard to swallow in some spots, but i actually dont play this game for the story. i love just wandering around and killing things. if you choose to do what i did and bumrush through the main story just to see what happens, it should still take a decent amount of time. ive been playing this game for two years and havent even touched the civil war that you can choose a side in. not to mention the hundreds of side quests this game has to offer. all in all. this is an awesome game. if youre not playing it yet, get it!",18.1
"if you do not own this game, hit the add to cart button now. this game is on my personal top three list, just barely beaten by wind waker. you will spend many days doing different side quests and leveling, so make space on your calander for the elder scrolls v: skyrim.",81.5
"this game is amazing. most likely the best game i have ever played. i recomend this to any gamer.",316.5
"bit of a no-brainer, an open, engaging world full of giant- dragons to stab in the face. i do recommend breaking out the mod manager and getting some improved menus and inventory mods in there but generally you cant go wrong recommending this one.",262.1
"one of the best games ive ever played by far. i will reccomend it to everyong i know :d.",110.3
"skyrim: the game in which you ignore the story, explore the world, meet interesting people and murder and pillage their homes and belongings like any good viking should. 10/10",24.5
"buy it. its a great open world game, and with funny mods i think its one of the best games i have ever played.",11.1
"everything we expected. gorgeous locations, loads of customisation options (and, in general, more balanced options) and tonnes of things to do. in general, the writing is better than usual, and the voice acting is (generally) better than oblivion. the combat system is barely better than oblivion and the magic system needs some work, but that does not stop this game from providing weeks of value straight out of the box.",414.2
"do i really need to say anthing about this game? its skyrim...",392.8
"as hype-trainy as it sounds, i believe that this is one of the greatest games of all time. this game is such a great experience with so many options and paths that i have 100+ hours logged and i feel like ive barely scratched the surface. this game is brilliant and i feel like everyone should experience it at least once.",208.6
"what the  its 9.99 i paid 29.99 for this when it came out, but its still fun and ill forgive it <3",63.9
"why the  are you here? theres an add to cart button for this product, just saying.....",114.0
"everytime i think im done with this game i figure something else to do, or another style to play with. skyrim is by far one of the best open world games to date, with player-made content constantly updating you will never run out of things to do.",178.2
"no roleplaying fan can pass skyrim. its very atmospheric & immersive. until you fight your first dragon youll  your pants & feel like a mountain of flames after defeating him. the endless options for modding is a additional great feature. hd fruits, more fishes in the sea, some giant bosses in the wilds, new monsters better language integration for german :) rly good game with a hundret of quests and many many playin-hours :)",268.3
"im not usually a rpg kinda guy, but ive sunk quite alot of time into this game. it nails almost everything you want it to for an rpg. plus there is a vary large modding community behind the game making countless mods to spice the game up more. the 2 biggest downfalls of the game are the glitches and the very disapointing ending. there are mods out that attempt to fix the overall buggyness of the game, but you will still encounter some every now and again. now the ending without spoiling anything is possibly one of the worst ive seen. if you thought mass effect 3 was bad you will be in for shock when you finally beat the 15+ hour main quest. other then that this game is great and i highly recommend it even for those of you that generally dont like rpg games. 8/10. btw wait until there is a steam sale as the game drops to 7.49$ quite frequently.",31.5
"best game ver, i think its the ebst game ive played in my life, atleast the longest. during chrismas wekk i put in 60+ hours into this game, its legendary. buy it.",151.6
"best among the rpg games i played. theres no other games that let you shout a king apart and ride on a freaking dragon doing your quests!",226.6
"this game took up over 425 hours of my life, great game, theres a bit of bugs but there mostly minor.",496.3
"an exciting storyline and very addictive gameplay, combined with modding this game will last you a very long time.",100.3
"skyrim is truely the best game i have ever played in my entire life. ive played various of game such as super mario bros and pokemon as a kid. growing up i began playing more violent games like grand theft auto, call of duty, street fighter 4, etc etc. everything about skyrim is really good. the soundtrack brought life to the game and enviroment in my opinion. the graphics and looks on the game is beautiful. several quests to do that will keep you playing after the main story quests. the best part of skyrim is that you can mod it to your liking, it could be skins, adventures mod, this game will keep you enterain for a long time. i dont normally do reviews either, but this game is as good as people say it is.",59.2
"this game is way too cool...youre gonna love it..get it while its on sale..youll love it even more..see you in december..",502.8
"i greatly enjoyed the game and its has amazing replay value because of the modding community",303.9
"its a fine game. just dont take it too seriously.",632.7
"safe to say this is one of the best games out there if you like adventure and magical storytelling. i loaded this with mods like climates of tamriel, vanilla nights, real rain, hd textures and purewater. its stunning on ultra!! allthough im not a fan of medieval kind of games, skyrim really sucked me in and i love to explore this game. it only gets better and better :) you should play this!",132.4
"100% love skyrim. i finally have a computer that can handle this game so i went on and invested the whole 10$ for the on sale game. so happy. computer said it would play it on high, well it handles on ultra without a problem so thats just another bonus. love love love it! first time i played was over a counsel. i had countless hours and somehow still hadnt beat it... so this time im going for the gold. nothing beats sitting back and wrecking some dragons!",3.0
"this game is a lesson in temperance. youre going to want to grab every sword, shoe, ing dead rat you run across because omg lootz. but you cant do that . because youre only one man, and you cant carry it all. well you can, if you want to move like a snail. and trust me i know people *cough* vsn *cough* who would gladly move the pace of a snail riding a turtle sitting up a pot smoking sloth that is unfortunately dead, just to carry all the  she wants. but thats bad. youre a bad person, vsn. you lack discipline! what are you going to do with 300 charrus eggs?! seriously. why the hell do you need 428 clocks of goat cheese?! no one needs that much cheese. put. the ing. broom. down.",205.1

"311 hours... this time, was not time wasted, but time sacrificed to the best medievil rpg series of all time. the elder scrolls... morrowind, oblivion, skyrim... and those before which i havent played. i bought this game right after a nasty break up and it got me through my school year then. i can easily say, that i owe my sanity, my current happiness, self-confidence and personality to this game. goodbye durza, goodbye brelok. goodbye alduin, serana and you too miraak.",311.4

"nearly perfect, but hugely flawed. i find that this game isnt playable until properly modded, because - for example - theres no sense of realism to running around in the cold all night without dying or getting lost. after its been properly fixed up, though, its wonderful. i love how much thought went into every aspect of the world. its like interactive tolkien, and thats the highest praise i can give. so what if its unrealistic - it was a genius move to open up the modding floor to everyone, and that allows me to fix everything wrong with it exactly to my taste. - sh",109.2

"i was hooked from the moment i woke up on the cart and am still hooked. i have been the quintessential wizard, dashing rogue as well as the antitypical orc diplomat. with so many different ways to play the vanilla game how can you not become enmeshed in the grandeur and spectacle that is tamriel? and just when you think you are done someone makes a mod that you have to try and then the cycle begins anew. its not real but the feelings are.",1177.5
"love this game, i mean you can keep playing and playing if you so wished. they have a lot of mods out there as well that you have the option of using. i really enjoy this game. :d was worth the money and now i just need to wait till i have spare money and get the final dlc that they have for it now, dragonborn :d",336.3

"a rather medioker game all in all, with sufficent amounts of lore and less than engaging moral choices. it is also very easily broken, to the point where i have killed dragons with nothing with my bare fists, or even killed them in one strike of my dagger. that said the modding community is what really makes this game come to life, adding more personality into every aspect you might wish from the game.",154.0
"i have never been a big fan of sandbox games. seriously i like small scale games with strategy and rpgs with a boring linear progression with a plethora of side quests. that is not to say this game doesnt work like that but really there is sooooo much you can do and sooo many side quests. when i finally started to play it, it became one of the best games i had ever played with story and world lore in abundance. you can spend hours reading every book in the world and days exploring every inch of this world. if you are looking for an escape there are few places better to escape to.",377.3

"okay first of all, this game looks amazing! and for twenty dollars its a giant game! this game has so much stuff that you can do, like explore caves, talk to people, do sidequests, or do the story, if you dont feel like playing a game that forces you to keep moving foward like the portal games (which are amazing btw) play this game! you can find so many secret things refrencing minecraft, portal, and other games. the coolest one has to be the headless horseman, so idk why you need me to tell you all these things about a four year old game, but oh well :) very much recommended",32.3

"this game is a masterpiece. the second you start your first adventure you will find yourself spending hours upon hours in the world of skyrim. there is so much to do in the game that you wont find yourself a dull moment. the dlcs for the game are just as good and add a ton more hours of game play onto your save. however, with the game being as big as it is, expect some bugs, graphical errors, and glitches. with that said, during my play through i rarely came across any and there are bug fix mods out there that can be installed to avoid these problems. there are a few voice actors that suck imo, and take you out of the world a bit. the game is a must buy if you have not played it yet. 9.5/10",138.1
"i really love this game pros +the world and story are rich +many many hours of gameplay time +immersive +nice exploration with hundreds of locations to discover +great skill tree +decent character customization (but kinda lacking in hair) +difficult choices and decisions cons -kinda linear on armor progression -lack voice acting variety -a bit repetitive combat on melee fighter -bugs and sometimes sudden crash the best thing is most of the cons can be fixed by mods,so you can really make this game almost perfect 8.5/10 but with mods i give it a 9.5/10",75.6

"the elder scrolls series has forever been a part of me, morrowind, oblivion and now skyrim -.. words cannot describe the experiences and the accumulation of hours that i have put into the games. skyrim nor displeases or fails to live up to the expectations. the gameplay and missions are extensive and unique and the rpg revolving around dragons is literally amazing. the shouts and skills operating around each character makes the game even more addicting. i totally recommend this for anyone, especially skyrim, alongside the older games and especially the newer one; the mmorpg.",4.3

"once i was a viking. i started off humble: swinging an axe to chop wood, crafting meagre weapons from the iron ore that sprung up around my home village. hours later i was a human flamethrower battling trolls and making impossible leaps from rooftop to rooftop assisted by screaming words in the language of dragons. another time i was a man-lizard who accidentally punched a guard and then like 37 guards went lapd on me, screaming profanity about me being an outsider to skyrim while they plunged their swords into my bum. then, when i thought i had seen it all, i found mods. oh mods, sweet mods, how you have changed the skyrim that i know. now the sounds of kenny loggins danger zone alert me that theres an autotuned bear around, prompting me to unleash my samuel l jackson themed dragon shouts. but i must be quick i see a monocle wearing crab scuttle away while the distant call of macho man randy dragon beckons oooh yeahhh in the skies above. seriously, how are you not playing this game yet?",204.3
"skyrim stands as the first new bethesda game with an entirely new engine. the creation engine generates fantastic visual splendor even on low performance computers, creating lush forest landscapes that intertwine with harsh and inhospitable winter tundras in the sacred homeland of the nord. fight unique monsters - in unique ways - using swords, shields, bows, spells, or a combination of each to take down foes that are always attempting to outwit - and outlast - you! skyrim utilizes a fantastic new dialog system which, in turn, reinforces the fantastic quest system we have come to know and love. dont like an element of how the game works? you can even change it with a devoted modding community always at the ready to provide fantastic new mods to an already overwhelming title. skyrim is huge, vibrant, life-like, and most of all, extremely fun. as an ardent fan of the elder scrolls frachise for over a decade, i would highly recommend this title to any diehard rpg fan or hack-and-slasher!",525.4

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played. it combindes amazing graphics, an original storyline, and unique player custimation to add depth and dynamic to the game. although in comparrison to oblivion many quests are simply lacking in length and content (companions) and therfore the conection your get to different guilds and your character. however, the game is still amazing and should be played by everyone.",259.9

"this game can live up to every expectation you would ever have, even if there are a few bugs and glitches, skyrim is probably the best open world game i have ever played, an open world where you can explore cities, dungeons and learn to use magick, all i can say is well done bethesda.",360.6
"i think this game is still one of the best rpg in the store. this is must-have for rpg fans. lots of deep stories, large map, swords and dragons... anything else needed? nope!",106.7

"so. much. stuff! overwhelming at times, in a good way. highly detailed open world for all of us to explore. years of replayability and storylines upon storylines upon storylines. another masterpiece from bethesda. the only thing i find odd from them is the way your character walks around with his weapons out like hes going to hand them to the enemy. minor issue, so minor its actually amusing to me now. oh, you want this!? of course my really liking this wonderful game doesnt stop me from calling it fallout and the holy grail. looking for castle anthrax to administer some spankings.",150.5
"all the questlines in this game make little sense and are very poorly written. so dont buy it if you want a very in-depth storyline with well-written characters and such. its a lot of fun to run around in tho. looks really pretty and it can be kind of atmospheric at times. you can install tons of mods to make it even prettier, though none of them will make the writing better. still kinda fun i guess",65.3

"ah, skyrim. the recognition this game recieved when it was released is almost unparalleled, yet, is it worthy of the awards and recognition that has been heaped upon it? first up, it is a bethesda game, so this means that your purchase of this game comes with free bugs and glitches. however, the majority of these are minor and easily resolved by reloading a quicksave, and lets face it - part of bethesdas charm is the bugs that come with their games. but the storyline....my god, quite frankly, its terrible, and the truth is, even the most dedicated skyrim fans claim the play the game despite the plot, not for it. fortunately, the world of skyrim is rife with dungeons, bandits and sidequests for you to complete. indeed, i had more fun exploring and having my character live out his life than i did hunting down the evil dragon overlord (or whatever it was). despite this, i couldnt help but feel dissapointed by the inherent emptiness of bethesdas world. gameplay value: 7.5/10",737.8
"i cant even count how many hours i spent on just vanilla one on my xbox and then i made the greatest decision to buy it on steam like i should have in the first place and with mods it is all completely new again. and the dlc adds a lot of content. 10/10 would ruin social life again",313.1

"do you have a girlfriend? boyfriend? family, or kids to feed? if you love them, you wont buy this game, cause if you do they wont see your face two weeks straight. all of the sudden that sick time and vacation you saved up over the years? gone. you were planning on using it towards taking a cruise to the caribbean, or perhaps going to china or your favorite country in europe. no, what happened was that you decided to buy skyrim with probably all of the dlc at this point. and now you live inside a hovel not knowing what the outside world looks like, and your employer thinks youre dead. cause thats what skyrim does. you think youre done playing, but youre not. youll come right back, you weak willed . ...its a great game which looks fantastic and has one hell of a soundtrack to it. there is a ton to do, and if you are new to the elder scoll games, just like i was, you will be able to adapt pretty easily. there are plenty of quests to do and a lot to explore. and if you like getting into the lore of your videogames there is a ton of it in the elder scrolls universe. at least, skyrim seems to have a lot anyway. and having access to the many mods for pc is an awesome bonus as well. this game is a time sink though. dont be surprised if you hit over a 100 hours playing this game...or 200 for that matter.",141.4

"great game, but whata bug-lish game! ssme (refer to:",293.2
"this game has exceeded my expectations and is the most fun game (besides dishonored). pros: this game is a freeroam (means you can roam freely), this is awesome because instead of having to go down a certain way you can choose many ways of getting to the same place. another pro is that you can choose the path that you want to go down (mage, warrior, thief). it also includes many oppritunities like to be an assassin to a farmer. cons: its easy to get lost, there is almost too many oppritunities, that it gets you swept away. the people constantly say the same thing like the guards will say  i used to be an adventurer like you, until i took an arrow to the knee. this is kind of a running joke with this game. over all is say this game is one of the best games i have ever played. id say two thumbs up and 5 stars. this game used to be 50$ when i bought it and it was worth the money. now i see its 20$ and i think its a very good deal on what i think the games worth. i hope this discription was useful on deciding on getting the game. good luck.",339.0

"well done bethesda, well done. after hours and hours spent in cyrodil in the elder scrolls iv, i am diving back in to another game of theirs and pouring even more into it. skyrim is amazing. almost overwhelming. beautiful vistas, imporved combat, a more fleshed out magic experience. and tons of content. this game will hold for awhile. there is so much to see and do, with locations to explore and quests to do around every corner, this is a must buy. not to mention the strong modding community that exists for this game, which will extend youyr play time even further.",155.4
"well, i dont have to tell a lot about skyrim. the quests and stories are good, the scenery is beautiful, i like the combat system. and with hdmods (or just the hi-res dlc) the game looks stunning as well. it is one of my favourite games at the moment. there are only a few things that can be improved, but most of them can be fixed by mods. my rating for the game: 8/10",72.1

"skyrim has one of the best graphics of the games fron 2011 in my opinion. this game is not like the most games. you dont have to follow the mainstory, you can do other quests if you want, you can make yourself stronger. its up to you what you do with your character. i really like that. its refreshing. there is so much to do in this game, many choices. you can become the great hero, a very skilled thief, an assassin, you can become the greatest warrior and you can even marry someone. i would recommend this, just because of the nice landscape and the stories.",419.2

"awesome open world game. lots of fun just walking around and doing quests. combat and quest system is still a bit shallow, but mods allow you to customize it some extent. overall i had a great time playing the game even if ive only scratched the surface on all the content available in the game.",27.4
"i can dual-wield mjolnir against puny mortals while kenny loggins danger zone roars in the background. if that doesnt appeal to you then i dont know what i say.",128.3
"the elder scrolls saga is by far the best set of games i have ever played! tesv is incredible. cannot wait for elder scrolls online. 4/4/14",282.1
"greatest game ever made. the development of this game seems unreal. you must stand in awe over the developers of skyrim. great gameplay, maps, missions. almost everything seems to be years of planning and implementation.",303.2
"its an amazing $60 terrain exploration simulator, and maybe thats not a bad thing after all. you can lose hundreds of hours in the beauty of this world, if not the characters. bethesda produces immensly solid titles that perhaps target the median a little too much, but they do it with a sincerety and devotion that is impossible to ignore. i strongly endorse this game.",88.5
"in theory, this should be a good game. its a huge world, with lots of variety so you dont get bogged down with a long line of very similar quests (as is often the case in rpgs). the graphics are gorgeous! buuuuuut, the pc version is full of bugs! it crashes constantly! the internet is full of people complaining about skyrim crashing on pc, and everyone has a different situation, making it almost impossible to solve. sadly, im so frustrated with this game that i cant see myself putting in too many more hours.",148.1
"what can i say about skyrim that hasnt already been said? if you own a pc and like video games you need to play skyrim, its just that simple. skyrim (and the previous elder scrolls games) are a large part of video gaming history. they created and perfected multiple genres of gaming that we see in many triple-a titles today. to be honest, if you consider yourself an intelligent gamer, you just dont know games unless you have played one of the elder scrolls titles. skyrim, or its predecessor oblivion, would be on anyones list of all-time best games. the storyline is complex and interesting; the world is huge and immersive; the combat is challenging, varied, and fun; and the amount of hours of fun that you can get out of this game is more than worth the full-price. if all of that wasnt enough, on the pc you can dowload literally hundreds of free mods that can completely change how it plays. you want to be a dragon-man? you can! you want to create your own spells? you can! do yourself a favor and buy this game!",198.8
"brilliant game. i am still enjoying it immensely. there is so much to this game and if you want to complete it you are going to need hundreds of hours. would definitely recommend.",227.7
"a fun game with great graphics and many quests. is that not enough yet? well, players can mod it freely and create their own content. and because of that, it really never gets boring. the only weak points of the game: - no multiplayer - main story quest, like in all the sandbox games, is rather weak.",83.6
"totaly recommend. lovely made, with an huge open world. 300hours + on cracked savegame. never finished story with my lvl 66 char... one of the best games i ever played. (graphic mods and enbs make it even more epic)",20.6

"no doubt about it! this is the game of the year! massive open world, do as you chose, play however you like. very atmospheric and beautiful world (and the characters no long look like manequins) buy this and it will suck you in for ages. well worth the purchase and much replayability!",481.7
"play this game. why? you dont even need an answer.",185.1
"a+ game to escape all the mmorpgs online. can play for hours.",13.4
"(dont mind the gameplay time, i have over 1000h here, but most offline) pros: +graphics (theres even a free dlc containing new particles) +storyline (not only the main story is immersive, the ammount of side quests helps fill in the details) +longterm (so, the main quest can be finished after some long hours, i finished mine in 50h+-, but doing some sightseeing, but you get lots of stuff to do and see during your journey, that can add up more 200h, or more) +tamriel story (so, if you are a fan of the elder scrolls series, this is set in a different era than the others titles, so you will know lore you didnt in the others games of the series) cons: -some bugs (what would be a open world rpg without some bugs, most are small things, walking over a pot, and it flies way, if it is in a certain position, for example, but not to worry, most of them do not affect gameplay) -longterm (i know i said this in pros, but it is also a con for some people. yes, you need to spend some time here, this is not a 1 day game, so, if you like short games, this is not for you) finally, the game in my opinion is 9/10, a must buy, with or without the dlcs",12.6
"great game. ive already spent a good 80+ hours on it and ive barely scratched the surface. lots of exploring to be done, lots of quests to be quested, lots of epic times to be had.",132.9
"if ths game was a person i would make sweet, merciless love to it.",107.0
"i do not have words which can explain how much i love this game. the graphics, the lore, the gameplay, even the rocks, trees and grass is so damn wonderful and cannot be compared to other games. this game offers you unlimited hours of gameplay thanks to its huge game world and mod support. you can simply not be a true rpg fan if you do not own this legendary game! 1000/10",384.1

"hours of fun but the followers can be a bit derpy sometimes",258.7
"do you want to spend the next +100 hours in a awesome video game? if so this game is for you! edit: if you have a low power pc (like me) get skyrim for the xbox 360 or ps3. i have skyrim on both pc and console. my computer isnt powerful enough to play skyrim.",3.4
"i yelled at someone in the town, a guard politly asked me to stop, i apologize and proceeded to set everyone on fire. 10/10",76.9
"you must have this game! it is one of the best games ever made and i have a few reasons why. first reason is that the game is huge, after 200 hours there is still a lot of things to do. the side missions are interesting and fun, they are not repetitive and sometimes more interesting than the main story itself. skyrim also have workshop support and the community have some great mods to expand the game whatever way you like! the game also doesnt force you to do the main quest, you can just enjoy the great skyrim nature and the amazing soundtrack and not worry about a thing. the only bad thing is that the game doesnt have any choice system so the world around you wont change much. score: over 9000!/10",451.6
"love skyrim - hopefully the hours i have put in will help when eso arrives!",34.9
"its an elder scrolls game, what else do i need to say.",37.4
"apex game of its generation. love the freedom to adventure any way you choose.",121.7
"i bought this game in january. 500+ hours.... whats the sun look like again?",501.4
"yes! best medieval game! i love this game so much! i highly recommend for expierenced rpg players... for ones that want a level based game like thief i dont reccomend... if ur new to this type then i suggest u start out with greatswords/collect arrows/steal keys/steal/take/collect coins/ take potions and food. then after ur good try out fallout. its basically elder scrolls with guns and its retro nucular apocalypse and zombie-type, great game! u will love both games. i promise.",30.7
"so i played this game for 300 hours on ps3. i stopped because the load times became unbearable. at times it took a full minute to go from inside of a house to the basement. playing this game again on pc remedies most of the problems i experienced on ps3 plus i get to play it in 1080p60+fps. i love this game. i love the fact that despite me doing my best to redo what i did in the last game i coming across new content in the same old places. if youre looking for a game thats long, dense, and filled with variety then this is the game for you.",173.7
"best open world game ever. if you are into modding games and love to waste a bunch of time look no further. easily put 300 hours into this game and it is still fun. great lasting appeal. note that you may want to be experience with at least general mods because there are a lot of mods that are necessary to fix bugs.",4.0
"had this game since it came out on xbox probably have well over a few thousand hours, but only recently started playing on pc but still. love this game to pieces. just when you think you had explored everything you can, suddenly a trail of bandits attack you from a new camp that always leads to treasures at the end. learning all the plot about the previous daedric princes is magnificent also, if you ever played any game by bethasda (excluding that home alone game they made, oh lord no) youll know it will be fun packed. if you love medevial/fantasy games, get it. its even on sale right now! how could you not",62.8
"it says it needs to update but it wont ive tried all the stuff it told me to do but it dosent work untill it works i dont recomend this game on steam please help",13.4
"what this puddle lacks in depth, it makes up for in vastness, great for a splash every now and then but look elsewhere if you want a nice long swim.",94.6
"if you have not played skyrim by now you have missed out! the game is simply amazing and easily my favourite game ever. there is never a dull moment or nothing to do since you can wonder the map for hours discovering caves and dungeons to explore. there are endless amount of quests other than the main story and the guild quests to complete, although if you do somehow complete the majority of them steam has set up a workshop for you to mod skyrim to your hearts content! or even make your own using creation kit! the detail of the game is amazing for how massive it is and really gives you a shiver when the deep red eyes of a draguar deathlord is looking into your soul or the excitement when you decapitate a bandit cheif the first time. not a disapointment, lived up to all expectaions. open for other opinions as this is mine, so please not hate if you think im over killing it. 9.5/10, there is never a perfect game, but this is dam close!",103.8

"i cant wait for the next elder scrolls game - nobody november 11 2011 was a turning point in gaming history, one that many awaited with my own person even regularly visiting a site that counted down to skyrims release. this game fulfilled just about every expectation we had for it and the mods took care of everything else. the biggest modding community out there, enough content to make one lose weeks of their life, immense replayability and a setting where everything feels in the right place.  eso, skyrim is forever.",252.3

"this is one of the best games i ever played (i played a lot of games trust me) . this is an epic open world rpg, the graphics are awesome, the story is awesome (i really like it cuz i love dragons ;d ) you nearly have unlimited quests and a giant world to explore and challenges to master. you can easily spend 150 hours on this game and its still not boring (not like other games after 10 hours of playing story is over). and because of the steam workshop you can load unlimited mods, new quests, extend the world, new weapons and many other things. 11 out of 10 because of pure awesomeness ;)",116.3

"amazing visuals and even better with mods, skyrim is surprisingly easy to run and has a vast emersive world full of things to do, i only have a few hours on the pc version but i have played 200 hours on console version but this game was made for pc and i cant wait to play more of it.",15.0

"where to start, this game has everything you could ever want from an open world rpg.",175.9
"very, very fun game. pretty intense straight from the start. only downfall is that your companions can can get easily lost. theyll eventually come back if you fast travel, but wont do you good if youre by yourself fighting a dragon. other than that, excellent game and i would recommend it to everyone.",21.0
"such a great rpg game. the graphics are wonderful, the whole story line is beautiful. 10/10",448.4
"this game is one of the best singleplayers only! it has over 40 hours of gameplay(including sidequests and dlc). and best of all there are many classes to choose from. warrior, assassin, mage, and many more! skyrim has many different characters with very different attitudes toward you. you also have dragonborn blood(get the game to know what this is). bethesda put a lot of work into this game and it has shown to be worth thier effort. get this game and your going to have a really great time!",7.8
"as someone who has put in quite a number of hours into this game on my pc, and almost three times that much on my 360, i can confidently say that this game was worth single cent. but youre looking at it right now, arent you? thats how youre reading my review? stop reading my review, and buy this game. you wont regret it.",130.3
"one of the best games ever. period. all of the depth and free-roaming fun you expect from an elder scrolls title, with some new features and a ton of content.",567.9
"significanly better than previous incarnations, with the possible exception of the expansion to oblivion, which was amazing. combat tended to be a joke from the very beginning, which was a problem considering that dragons were supposed to be some kind of apocalyptic threat (i mean that was the plot, right?) and by the end of the game you were smashing them in a single blow. also, i felt some of the plot ramifications of your decisions were unrealistic and tended to punish the player for no real reason. still, these were somewhat minor flaws. i very much enjoyed the game on the whole and wholeheartedly recommend it.",358.5
"first thing i did in riverwood was kill a chicken, that ended up adding 5 bounty to whiterun. > one of the best games ive ever played > tons of fun sidequests > adding mods makes the game twice as fun > scenery in this game is absolutely outstanding > an instant classic 10/10",37.4

"a couple years ago i bought oblivion, and didnt have much fun with it (all i did in oblivion was see how high i could get my bounty. i never touched quests. at this point in time i wasnt really interested in rpgs or games i have to scavenge in. dead island and warframe took care of that. i got this game thinking i wouldnt play it much because of my experiance with oblivion. i was so wrong. i booted it up as soon as it finished downloading and havent played another game since. ive completed the main questline and the main questlines for dawnguard and dragonborn, but i still have so much more todo. plus the steam workshop has so much to offer, and so does creation kit. this has so far been one of the best games ive played on steam. if you get it, say good bye to actually getting real life stuff accomplished.",65.9

"this is a fantastic game! dont be fooled by my recorded hours on steam; ive logged more hours than i can count playing this game on the xbox 360. bethesda has done a tremendous job creating an entire universe that you are free to explore and interact with in any way you choose, right down to who your character is, what he/she can do, and how he/she looks. there is so much to do all the time, so you can always do something different each time you play. the graphics are terrific, and the environment in skyrim is absolutely beautiful. bethesdas attention to detail is exquisite, and the general look of the game shows how much effort theyve put into their graphics. overall, the gameplay is great. the combat controls are very simple, which makes it easy to fight your enemies. leveling up your character and choosing different skills to hone are also very simple tasks. its easy to play as a warrior, mage, thief, or a mixture. you can be anything or anyone you want to be in this game. the story lines are good as well. there are all sorts of story lines that you can play through in addition to the main quest, and all of the ones ive played through have been quite enjoyable. on a scale of 1 to 10, id give skyrim a 9.5. when you play it, you see why its such an acclaimed, well-respected game.",35.1
"without thinking about it for a second, id be very likely to tell anyone that skyrim is among my top five favorite games of all time. i could write a novel describing why any and everyone should play it but then...well, this would be a novel and not a review. keeping to the point, skyrim is the deepest, prettiest, largest, most expandable, most entertaining, most rewarding, time-sinkiest, dragon-killingest (you get the idea) rpg ive ever laid two thumbs and sixty bucks on. skyrims a game that gives you a quest and ten seconds later youre gawking at a landscape or chasing a dragon and you slip on the drool produced by your jaw-numbing awe and end up in a dungeon halfway across the wilderness putting arrows in a necromancers eyeballs. it is rife with the most purposeful and enjoyable slew of distractions any fan of fantasy can imagine and is kind enough to autosave for you while you forget just how off-track youve gotten. arm yourself to the teeth, crack dragon skulls, relive the louis and clark expedition and save the world!",84.8

(i recomend playing at an adept or legendary game difficulty or the game will seem a bit slow) -enthusiastic",13.7
"if you dont mind a little tinkering, this game can be one of your all-time favourite purchases. any elder scrolls game wouldnt be complete without a massive modding community, helping you to twist the game to any of your fancies. want to make the game better looking? mods. want to have more realistic in-depth lore while you explore the land? mods. want to bash your enemies with a captain america shield and a squeaky toy while using a dragon shout to call forth thomas the tank engine? mods. no seriously, there are mods for that last one.",197.5
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazing game. awesome gameplay, display, graphics, and art make it a desirable game.",38.3
"honestly, im having the time of my life playing this.",292.9
"words cannot be put together to describe this game, but ill do my best. fantabulous. it is an incredibly immersive game with epic gameplay, good plot, good graphics, brilliant lore and awesome loot. should you get this? why do you not have it already? get it now!! 9.5/10",140.1
"never got tired of this game, because of its immensity, variability and beauty. the music is epic, charming and relaxing. a downside of this game, are the few but annoying bugs, but the majority of them can be easily fixed. the vanilla game itself can get repetitive sometimes, but with the addition of mods, the game is practically infinite. 8.5/10",624.6
"do you not already own this?!?! how have you been surviving. sure you got food, water, and shelter, but this, this is a real neccessity. it is an open world ready with secrets to discover and adventures to travel on. fighting dragons is but a part of your quest to be the best warrior in skyrim. but only if you want to of course. being a thief, or assassin is just as amazing for portraying your incredible stealth, unless you plan to be the archmage of limitless magical powers! casting fire and lightning on your quest to kill the high king of the land! there is always combinations if you prefer spreading your bard-like knowledge. so go on! fulfill your quest, and become a true dragonborn!!!!",114.9
"comparing to oblivion and the fact that es:iv was awesome, skyrim can be a disappointment in many cases, but oblivion aside, its a fun game to play, great adventures, great graphics and in total a perfect rpg, you should play it, and dont forget the 3 dlcs",25.1
"this is  i get stuck right before i make my charecter this is all as  other reviews this is",154.1
"hands down, favorite game, hours of fun quests and missions to do, unlimited replayablity, ive put in over 600 hours at the time of this review.",653.7
"great rpg, very immersive and so many quests and things to do, youll be playing the game for a while.",124.8
"i obviously havent put near the amount of time into skyrim as some of you guys (i am only at 280 hours as of writing this short review), however, the amount of time i have put in is far more than what i normally put into a game, and with skyrim i feel as though i have barely scratched the surface. i havent been moved by a game in such a way since playing the original halo back in 2004. in fact, i cant recall ever being moved by a game in this manner. i dont want to risk boring you by going on about why i feel so strongly about this game, as i can say absolutely nothing that hasnt been said before, and frankly, i am wanting to play the game rather than talk about it. but what i will say, and with the total and absolute honesty of someone whos been a gamer for 25 years and played thousands of games, is that skyrim is quite simply the greatest game i have ever played.",287.2
"i wish the skill system was more like oblivion, but. whatever. i became bored of this game very quickly on console. however im still having fun with it on pc do to modability, which made it so i can have the oblivion/morrowind system through mods. if you can, get this on pc, not console.",105.8
"so far best rpg game of 2011, 2012, and 2013! bethesda has done it again creating another world in which, the player can become a living [art of the game! i recommend skyrim for everyone who loves adventure and action! i give it a 10/10!",479.2
"i loved the game so much, neat graphics. neat story. good animation, and story, but its remindes me of cod:mw, just without guns, go to a, from there go to b and get c. but its fun. because its a fresh thing. in here you can go to some directions, like go to jail and break out, if you dont want to, [because if you did go to jail you lose all of your stuff] so you can just roll back while auto-saving. the game has a secret message of peace, if you go with power when you speak to people, you will get screwed. whell i really enjoyed my first hours in the game. totally recommend.",3.7
"great game, loved it on the xbox and for 3.74 what a deal, fin and enjoyable games plus those ,pds",17.9
"really good game. my profile just says like 100 or 200 i think but ive put 600+ hours into this game from a different profiles and steam does not record time that you play in offline mode. great great great game tons upon tons of sidequests ive put that many hours and still havent come close to finishing it. good storyline and for 2010 good grapics. probably the best game for the price youl ever buy. it got knocked down to 20 but it was still the best game for the price when it was 60",266.7
"there is so many ways to play this game, and so many things to explore that i could have easily put in another 200+ hours had i not completed all the achievements. if you dont like grinding, theres plenty to do. if you like grinding, build a house. or three...",227.1
"the questline for skyrim is epic to say the least and the variety of side-quests and other shenanigans makes the replay value infinite. the ability to mod your game is priceless and creates even more possibilties. the dlcs are kick-a$$ and if you can pick up the legendary addtion, by all means do so. however, approximately 5 voice actors were used in the entire game. oh yeah, i took an arrow to the knee is a metaphor for marriage. when you propose you get down on one knee, hence taking an arrow to the knee. yiur welcome and you may now stop using that joke. thank you.",96.2
"well, needless to say that skyrim is one of the best games around. statistically its the most played singleplayer game on steam.",57.4
"this game is amazing. if you download all the mods it gets more interesting and fun. wew!!!",90.6
"skyrim...is...perfect ! :d i litteraly cant explain how much epicness this game is packed with. i can even call it the best rpg  have ever bought. i have it for both my pc and playstation 3 but its definetly more fun on the pc ! i always waited for that time to fully mod the crap out of this game and cheat all the way through,venutring in skyrims bigest and most fearsome wildlands fighthing the horrors of this cold land. what are you waitting for ? go buy now !",1.1
"this game does almost everything right, a wast open world, interesting quests, loads of loot, a huge modding community with awesome mods for the extra eye-candy or additional content like new quest-lines and even complete new settlements which you can build and level by yourself. in fact, theres so much to do ingame that i have a hard time getting anything done in the main-quest because i get sidetracked all the time. the only negatives i can think of is the abysmal user-interface developed solely for controller. but theres a mod for that too which does wonders usability-wise, so thats not a huge problem either if you are a bit tech-savvy and the less than perfect combat system which could use a overhaul as well. one of the very few aaa-titles in the last years that didnt dissapoint me at all. a must have for all open world fans. granted, the rpg elements arent really all that rpg-y because you have no real impact on the world, but theres so much to do that it didnt matter for me",317.7
"it is my favorite game and its open world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",12.9
"came back to the game after first enjoying it at release. the skyrim mod community is fantastic and, coupled with the dlc, have really turned the game in to something truly awesome. everything else about the game you probably already know - engrossing stories, hundreds of things to see and do, and a strong sense of connection to your uniquely crafted character. one of the best there is.",82.9
"extremely fun game and im glad i got it for only 5 bucks! you should get this one or the legendary one",21.1
"without any doubt one of the best games ive ever played. if you dont have this game yet, buy it here for pc because its sooo much better than other consoles. you have an endless ocean of options, quests, land, weapons and adventure. did you buy it now? yes? great! now go play! ...did you play? awesome! now make it even more awesome with mods! not satisfied with how your game looks? google for skyrim enbmod and look around on the skyrim nexus for nice texturepacks. want your game to be more immersive? there are mods for that! even more realistic? mods! horny? adult mods! mods? mods!",43.1
"skyrim is one hell of an amazing game. it has a huge open world, a lot of unique items, spells and enemies, an amazing story (or should i say a lot of those?) and if it wasnt enough theres plenty of user content that you can download through the steam workshop and/or nexus. id go as far as saying its one of the best games ive ever played.",191.5
"interface is annoying as hell, game crashes on alt+tab without mods, and theres significantly less customisation than in previous tes games. the game likes to crash randomly, the textures are worse than in oblivion, and the voice acting seems pretty shonky, since everyone speaks in some kind of russian accent.",188.9
"this is so ing addicting! great game, some minor bugs but due to its vastness completely ignorable!",89.5
"one of the most fun, entertaining and adictive rpg games of all time. brilliant game for rpg players and people who like magic.",25.4
"i played this game in a pirated version.. bought this game on sale... a true open world game... literally, you can screw with every item around you... get into rooms, places.. etc.. the mission mode is also flexible... you can do it on your own pace (relaxed or hardcore)... in terms of open world, this is the best open world game!!!!",8.0
"if you like previous elder scrolls games you will like skyrim. there are lots of mods so you can customise the game to your hearts content.",172.2
"one of my most played rpgs other than dark souls. ive spent hours apon hours playing, moding, and just having a blast. i would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs, good lore, and killing dragons.",113.6
"best game ever if u dont have it get it or dieeeee!!!!",188.5
"my second favorite game ever especieally when modded =)",164.5
"cool game. rpg with free advancing and open world.",54.7
"at the start of the game i ended getting stripped by a bunch of  bandits then an imperial guard gave me some pants and i fled. by the time i reached a nearby town, i tried cross-breeding a dragon with a rabbit. the rabbit kept leaping out of the dragons  so i just effed the rabbit up doggy style. i saw a man sleeping in his comfy bed, but i had the urge to break into his butt. guards caught me and i was brought into this court full of as bandits. they said told me that thy were gonna allow this violation as long as i were to  inside. that sums my skyrim life story up 10/10 game of the century!!!!",7.0
"okay, i will give skyrim the obligatory recommendation. whats there to say? another sprawling bethesda epic. the only somewhat legitimate criticism ive seen about skyrim is regarding how bethesda tends to release games full of bugs thinking that users will come up with mod fixes. i dont know about that as i cant say ive ever played a bethesda title i considered broken. what i will say is that users in the steam workshop have come up with some truly incredible mods. deducting a point from bethesda is one way to look at it but i say giving people the freedom to use steam workshop gives them a point right back. the fact that it is a game so many people feel compelled to create so many mods for speaks volumes. bethesda must be doing something right.",126.6
"an ocean with the depth of a puddle, is the best way to describe skyrim. dont let that turn you away however. if youre new to the elder scrolls, skrims gameplay and easier ability to mod in my opinion gives it an edge over the previous games in the series. the main story for skyrim in my opinion is the best among the elder scrolls, and while that will surely not be your focus, while exploring the landscape and finding random quests, dungeons, what have you the main story gives you plenty of interesting shouts aswell as progressively making the game more challenging. if you arent familiar with the open world nature of an elder scrolls game or fallout, its a vast world with plenty of people to talk to, places to see, monsters to kill, books to read, and cabbages to fill your home with. it has something for everyone and while it may not be a great game for one thing, it does a lot of things well enough to keep your attention for hundreds of hours.",106.9
"between xbox and pc, i have logged a stupid number of hours on this game. never really cared about the actual plot, but its great for killing time and role playing, especially with mods.",125.6
"skyrim is an amazing game tat deserves a 10/10. the world is massive and there is so much detail put into it. its fun to walk around the different towns, talk to people, pick up sidequests, and explore. the leveling up is great and you can decide what you want your character to be (thief, warrior, etc.) the main quests are mostly enjoyable and combat is pretty fun. for $20 or less, skyrim will not disappoint.",86.7
"great storyline, fantastic quests, some hilarious dialogue, fine mechanics, charming npcs, brilliant companions and to top it off, theres mods.",487.4
"amazing game, countless hours of fun to be had, if you dont have it, get it!",146.8
"wait... there are only elder scrolls 3-5 on steam... they didnt add 2, so (elder scrolls)5-(elder scrolls)2=3. half life 3 confirmed!!! i love getting murdered by people because of chickens. 12356748928e+141534634 pancakes out of 10.",26.9
"mhhh how to describe the elder scrolls v: skyrim.... e p i c this game is the best openworld/rpg game i ever saw! you can go everywhere! you can do what you want! you can make your own story, you are dovakiin!",274.5
"would be one of the best open world rpgs if bethesda made the game multiplayer!",80.9
"favourite game so far, absolutely love the elder scrolls and bethesda. massively good game, couldnt reccomend it more.",109.8
"an excellent addition to the elder scrolls franchise. for fans of morrowind and oblivion, welcome to the next chapter. jaw dropping monsters, top of the line graphics, and an open world that makes you feel like you are living that life. numerous quests allow near-endless gameplay and a constant feel of a changing enviroment. always something new to do, and somewhere new to explore. great combat system that allows dual wielding, duel spellcasting or even a combination of both. and of course, get ready to kill some dragons!",31.0
"skyrim good game graphics are sweet u can mod all u like its an rpg with endless fun what more do u want?",69.0
"played this game over and over and it never gets old! must buy",303.6
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a great game for anybody who enjoys rpgs. it has vertually limetless character options and a lot of replay value, seriously, you can play this game countless times and never get bored of its many storylines. if you get this game, be sure to check out the workshop for even more hours of enjoyment with mods.",47.9
"pretty damned close to perfection. id place new vegas just a squeak ahead because fallout, but skyrim actually does some mechanics better. the only complaint id have is how easy it is to fall into the sneak and archery route. gorgeous, inviting, involving, and endless. a joy every gamer should experience.",305.1
"its a fun game but it will never meat the level of morrowind and i dont mean grafical",187.9
"probably the best free roam game i have ever played, if you havent tried this game, one time will be enough to get you hooked for hours on end. this game takes a ridiculous amount of time to finish making it have very high replay value.",128.6
"i just love skyrim. the elder scrolls are my favorite game series besides bioshock and it is just amazing. whether its the scenery or the gameplay, skyrim just has it all.",36.1
"addictive, submersive - just buy the damn game already!",627.9
"once in a while, a new game comes along and completely changes everything we thought we knew about games. it takes that idea, flips it upside down, mixes it around, sets itself on fire and with the mysticism of a phoenix, rises out of the ashes as something new yet familiar. skyrim is that game. this is a world beautiful beyond belief; an experience you simply cannot put to words but have to live to believe it. if you are not playing this game right now, you are missing out on possibly one of the biggest things gaming has seen in any generation of games. bethesda has set a new standard with this title... but one thing boggles me beyond all reason. there must have been some serious black magic involved with the development of this game, because how did todd howard fit all of this content onto one dvd disc?",358.9
"what else can i say that hasnt been said. endless hours of fun and so many character skill choices and combinations that it rarely gets boring. just find your favorite play style: fighter, mage, thief and get started today!",528.8
"amazing game ! endless hours of gameplay and quests with loads of in game roleplaying potential. you can buy a house settle down with a wife ,pillage towns,pickpocket kings, teebag guards i would recomend this game to anyone. and with the dawn guard dlc the infinate world of skyrim just got bigger ! in this amazing free roaming adventure. world of advice dont become a vampire ! (well unless you want people trying to kill you all the time) this amazing game will challenge you with traps and puzzles and from a horrific monster down to a lowly skever it captures the minds of children and adults alike. wow ! i have lost so many hours playing this wonderous game unlimited potenital and a diverse range of weapons ranging from a bow and arrow to a fireball and staff exellent role playing compatibility, and praticaly endless quests and fun to be honest :)",166.8
"if you like rpg and first person games this is the game for you.",58.8
"normally i dont review games but due to an overwhelming amount of friends asking me if skyrim is a good game i feel the need to set some things straight. skyrim in a nutshell is one of the best rpgs that i have ever played simply because of its non-linearity. for those of you who may not know a linear game is one that simply lets you play through the story line with little to no side quest or free roam, which as you may have guessed is highly frowned upon by many. skyrim however is anything but you can fully customize your character, explore what you want when you want, gather followers who assist you in battle, and one of the greatest features in my opinion be what ever lineage you want to be. for instance with some video games your either good, bad, or neutral with little varience, but in skyrim you can be good bad or neutral at any given time due to the elder scrolls brilliant story plot, and a history so realistic you might even find yourself exploring the lore behind skyrim. but if i had to say the best feature it would probably be the four other games just waiting for you to explore, each revealing a different location in tamriel. spoiler: did i mention elder scrolls online? well if you didnt know already now you do :)",289.6
"one of the most emersive and all around expansive games i have played on the pc to date.",477.6

"not much more that can be about this game that others have not said. epic. that is all...",78.9
"you will get lost in this game and not go outside for two weeks.",83.8
"this game, eventhough it has a few glitches, is an almost perfect game, i say almost because the length of the main story isnt that long, but the amount of side quests and all the things you can become involved in is pretty numerous. the graphics are outstanding, the music is amazin which adds to the epicness of the game. you will never play a game made before this that has a more interactive combat system. because of the creation kit, players can create homes, towns, dungeons, quests, weapons, armor, accesories, alter crafting, even change the overall look of the game world itself. worth every penny.",66.1
"really great game, i like the variety of different types of character you can be....i can be quite challenging, but an overall great game.",11.1
"this game is slowly eating away at the hours of my life 10/10.",748.8
"a fantastic game to play for many and long hours. good character building, big areas to explore and many mods to personalize your game play. i strongly recommend it.",212.0
"the console version rekindled my love of not hating life, im hoping the pc version can do the same",43.0
"the social life killer! buy this game if you want people to be concerned about your health",88.4
"one of the few rpgs that are worth your time and money,if you consider yourself a gamer,you must have skyrim in your library.",323.0
"now it looks like i havent played much but, i have play at least 200 hours on the xbox and another 12 on here. this game is like your casual rpg but with over 500 hours of gamplay and so much extra content not including mods. it however does have a few bugs barely noticable but still there.",28.8
"this game can be very..very..very..long if your ocd for sidequests like i am..(i dont even know if i have the main story in my quests) and worried about walking into the infinate looping sidequests. the game has a few bugs in but its nothing game breaking, its enjoyable to rpg fans and obviously to elder scrolls fans. the 1st dragon kill can be very satisifiying but after like 10 of them it just feels like a normal enemy since the random spawn is so common.",272.0
"this game has it all. once you start youll never leave the land of skyrim.",129.2
"amazing brilliant game with endless mods which means the game will live on.",1191.5
"lets be honest, best game ever made, you cant go wrong here. also modding this game makes it twice better. 10/10.",133.4
"godly. glorious. majestic. perfection. merged together all in one.",394.9
"its a good game and also good graphics with the player but reason is with me i only use cheats but the trolls just creep me out because of the face and i dont like it when you kill someone the guards just come and take your money or kill you and when they take your money everything for me is gone but i would tottaly use the kill command on them to stop getting me but the jarl never dies which is annoying but i like the rubys,daedra hearts,necklaces and also all the jewels and gold but i like the texture of everything in the game and the ingots have wonderful textures. i love this game :d",165.0
"normal, this game is awesome. but modded, thats where it becomes a dream.",88.8

"some dude in whiterun asked if i ever tried mercenary work, and that it might suit me. i tried mercenary work. it suited me. 11/10",108.0
"awesome open-world rpg. huge world with numerous points of interest to visit. good amount of customization with the ability to play how you want (melee, ranged, spell caster, etc.) enjoyable main story line, with a satisfying end, unlike most games. there are lots of gripes and nitpicks about the pc version. many things could be better and more fleshed out, but the game is enjoyable to casual and hardcore players alike. i find this game a bit clunky at times, but is overall much more enjoyable all-around than i found oblivion to be. lots more to say, but youll just have to play it for yourself to judge. i give it a 9/10 because its definitely not perfect, and theres a lot more to be desired, but its not an unplayable game by any means, and definitely has a hundred hours worth of content, if thats what youre into.",35.7
"when you spend half your playtime rearranging different objects in your house in a virtual world, you know you have a great game!",124.9
"probably one of the greatest games in the history of games. cannot wait to play online action.",16.7
"good game one of the best in all the elder scrolls series an exellent choice for any elder scrolls fan.",38.8
"i would not have recommended this game three years ago. however the mod community, lowered price and *excellent* expansion pack content make skyrim a must-own, and not for the vanilla experience. i will stand by my opinion that oblivion was better, especilly in the uniqueness of the quests it offered as opposed to find x in cave full of draugr, and dont get me started on the bs but the combat is better in skyrim argument since the same bad combat system is just hid behind fancy execution moves. but the expansion pack content is genuinely interesting and through modding ive made my game a hardcore and fast-paced experience that feels not unlike diablo, (to clarify thats in pure intensity and not literally like a dungeon-crawler). its disappointing to have to merely say the mods make this game but thats the harsh reality in this case. the expansion content however, as ive stated twice already, is high-quality and only emphasises how mediocre the vanilla game is. edit: also i would highly recommend playing this game with a controller. the character feels more weighty to me that way, although that could be personal preference - you will have trouble playing an archer that way.",384.0
"i love this game and would recommend this game to anyone who really likes an open world gmae. not only is there a lot to play and dlc, but even many more hours with all the mods this game has.",228.1
"skyrim, oh where to start. i got the game for the xbox 360 christmas 2011 (yes i was a console peasent back then) and was instantly dragged into a fanboy state. i remember the opening cutscene playing and i just sat there squeling like a little girl. after powering through the tutorial i was faced with the massive worldspace and the hours of exploring, questing and fighting that lied ahead. as i slowly walked towards the town of riverwood, i saw the amazing variety of landscapes that sprawled out across the world and stood in awe wondering where to begin. on the subject of gameplay, despite a few minor bugs (which have mostly been patched by mods like the unofficial skyrim patch and bethesdas own patches) its extremely fun and engaging. the way the combat feels is amazing (expecially the archery) and the more tedious tasks (crafting, enchanting and alchemy for example) are fun and rewarding in their own way. the story was exciting (if a little bit predictable) and the characters were interesting. however there are (as with all games) some downsides. you can find yourself forced down a few paths and sometimes youll experience game breaking issues (like one of the master spell quests was bugged for me) but it doesnt take away from what a truely great experience skyrim is.",410.4
"its skyrim. this is my thrid time buying this game.",44.5
"i dont know how to put it in words but this is one of the best games ive ever played. and with the mods you can do just about whatever the  you want.",136.9
"its a good game with a good long storyline. great for gamers who spend a long time on games.",191.4
"worth every penny. there is so much things to do in the game. so many possibilities, quests, dlcs. simply always fun to start over and try something new. huge world to explore, magnificent landscapes, etc. mods are awesome as well. one of the best games around.",42.6
"overall, a really amazing game that gives the player a lot to explore and learn about the huge world of the elderscrolls. in detail, this review being in 2014, id give: gameplay : 8/10 story : 9/10 graphics : 7/10 (without mods) sound : 7.5/10 a great purchase for those looking for a deep medieval/nordic style rpg",27.3
"everyone knows skyrim. i enjoyed oblivion more. *gasp*",85.3

"with all of the add ons and dlc this is an awesome game.",157.6
"the modding is so insane that you end up spending most of your time modding instead of playing the game. 10/10 would mod again",143.2
"tes v skyrim is one of those long lasting experience games that is today, and in days to come, bending, twisting and shaping the genre that we call open world rpg. if you are an rpg, a fantasy action roleplay, a first-person action game fan, and a powergamer, and even if you are not, you are probably gona enjoy this game alot, because it has so much to offer. the depthness and imersiveness factor of it is roughly 90%+ and it can be customized via the mods and other tools. the amount of details put in making the artwork of this game so unique is also by all means immensive. so get it! mod it (with skill)! and finally enjoy it! cheers :)",304.2
"this will be a big hell yes! if you like either of the previous games (morrowind or oblivion) you probably already have, beat, possibly more than once, and may have aleady done so with skyrim. if not, then even if you have not played the others its a great and fun game. both first-person and third-person available on the fly and each has its merit. loads of hours of entertainment (plenty of things to just distract you or engage you) and can be played so many ways. that is all before you even attempt the tons of user created mods found on the steam workshop, skyrim nexus, and other places as well as if you want to mess around with the creation kit yourself. if you get this (with or without the dlc) then you are getting a huge game. also, dont forget the free hd textures they offer as dl as well. for those looking for a number then here you go - 9.5/10 (9.5 just because i enjoyed it so much that i wanted more). enjoy and enjoy some more.",35.4
"worthy addition to the series. oblivion was a letdown and skyrim returns to morrowinds unique feel and personality, though it can not fully match it. skyrim is still a must play for elder scrolls fan and any player who enjoys adventure and exploration. the game becomes phenomenal with mods, you can feel and live through every moment, every battle and encounter. best way to play skyrim is to roleplay your character, commit to its personality and view the world through its eyes. you can really fire up your imagination, break free of scripted dialogues and storyline and live through your own story and adventures. this will open up whole new way for you to play and enjoy games, no longer a mindless consumer addicted to snippets of pre-writen script pieces, you can forge your own story with every step you make. better yet, start a journal or video series describing and documenting your adventures, get off your read only stasis and start being creative. open world, sandbox, free adventuring are endless fun and possibilities. stop being silly puppet unable to think something fun up without explicit designer instructions, would you kindly? for mods you can check this great thread.",441.6

"the latest installation in the elder scrolls has had me captivated for so many hours i dont even want to actually know, but buying it from the day of release on 11.11.11, to this day it still lies high on my list of games to play when im bored. escapism at its greatest, and when youre given so much freedom its so easy to get lost in, skyrim is no.1 for rpg games ive come across in terms of replayability, design and gameplay. people may mock it for its petty flaws here and there, but its list of flaws compared to its list of triumphs is dwarfed massively. with lore so deep, i dread to think i may know more about elder scrolls history than real life history, but this is just yet another aspect of not only the game, but the series which makes the world feel so real and alive. with un-beaten character customisation and development, this allows players to create any character they can possibly imagine and play to as style which they choose. to any rpg fans whom havent yet discovered the elder scrolls series or for those looking to get into the genre, i cannot recommend this game enough, if you fall in love with the series like all elder scrolls fans do, youll get your moneys worth without a doubt.",13.0

"as with previous bethseda titles tesv needs a good dose of modding to truly unleash its potential. having said that the base game along with the dlcs are more than worth its current pricing. for a 2011 title it has solid graphics supported by an excellent sound track by jeremy soule. the soundtrack is well composed and has alot of themes veterans of the elder scrolls series would be familiar with. unfortunately in terms of story immersion the game is greatly let down by the rail roaded quests and options as well as the limitations in dialogue options. another major gripe that has since been rectified by mods is the user interface. while the interface is not unusable the vanilla interface appears to have been designed to cater for console users. overall a good purchase for all rpg users.",884.4
"an amazing game to pass time or to just relax and have fun. steam workshop has had many great and exiting mods to continue your experience. some may find this game dumded down from its predecessor but its still a great game none the less. even without the dlc, skyrim is still a very enjoyable game to play and have fun.",292.4

"skyrim is oblivion: redux, a modern re-tooling with obvious improvements over the previous game, but hindered by the same flaws. the game is great, but constantly reminds you that you are playing a game and obstructs immersion. once again, i feel totally detached from the story, and eventually even the fun character construction turns into a grindy optimization addiction.",354.7

"i even got my sister to play it. but, then she wouldnt give me my computer back. thats usually how i pitch it. and even as awesome as the game is on its own merits, i follow it up with ... it gets better. thanks to the amazing modding community, ive added nearly a gb of extra content and polish. however, (disclaimer) just because you can doesnt always mean you should. installing mods can potentially make the game unplayable, or a more pristine product than bethesda produced. either way, its hard heap anything but praise for the game itself.",231.2
"my first playthrough of skyrim was on the 360, where i played the story of the game to completion. there is a reason for me saying this right off the bat. im saying it so you can understand what i mean when i say the pc experience is so much more different than the console version. and its not because of the usual suspects one considers when thinking of a pc release. sure the graphics can be set to higher quality and the game loads somewhat faster, but these are really only the most superficial differences. the major difference in skyrim on the pc and skyrim on a console is you. by that i mean the collective you, the modders and the community around popular and upcoming mods like skywind and skyblivion, all enabled by the versatility of the creation engine developed by bethesda. i cant wait to see what lies ahead for the inevitable new fallout running on this engine. this also poses a problem, that being you may find yourself spending most of your time adding and making sure mods are working and cooperating with one another, than actually playing. just try to actually play the game once in a while and smell the roses.",58.3
"game of the year 2011. it would take me days to think of all the things you can do in this game, but here are the some of the major features. explore a huge map, join factions, slay dragons, hunt, customize your character, engage in combat with bandits, animals/mysterious creatures, mages, etcetera, develop your dragonborn into the strongest being in all of tamriel, and much, much more. if you enjoyed oblivion and previous elder scrolls games, you will fall in love with skyrim.",438.5

"i loved the hell out of oblivion. but skyrim has consumed my gaming life for over a year now and im not even close to being tired of it. the level of world immersion i get from it is hard to describe. sometimes im like thats really video-game-y and others i really get a sense of awe from the lore and backstory these games have but what i love most about them is the sense of exploration, coupled with the urge to actually role-play my characters. my khajiit is basically a paladin and would never join the theives guild or the dark brotherhood, so i never did those quests with him. my argonian, however, has no such issues. you can play this game so many different ways, and customize your character to a ridiculous extent. use a few mods to iron out the rough spots (sky ui and catagorized favorites are must-haves) and you have a game that you can literally play forever. im not sure what will come along that dethrones it for me, but right now this is probably my favorite game of the last 5 years.",938.9

"please keep in mind that the review given here is from the viewpoint of someone playing all settings on low on a computer just barely capable of handling the game. graphics: absolutely fantastic for my pcs power. the shaders on things like water are especially gorgeous, plant life is amazingly varied. only complaint is that npcs have overly-shiny skin like theyre really greased up. controls: normally i hate default controls, but this game doesnt have a bad setup despite still having a learning curve. audio: i wish there was an option to put the audio through my speakers regardless of whether or not my headphones are in. the sounds and vocals are great, but they mute to almost nothing if youre in skype at the same time. gameplay: a little chaotic in the tutorial, but afterwards seems pretty intuitive. lag: this part is awful. theres just no nice way to say it. if your machine just barely scrapes by the system requirements, do yourself a favour and turn on godmode or youre going to get your backside handed to you pretty quick because you just cant even get turned around until a wolf has knocked you a good six or eight times or more.",354.2

"absolutely excellent adventure game. not as much of an rpg as its predecessors, but still stays true to the elder scrolls lore and feel. the biggest drawback is the go here, kill that, pick that up, and bring it back feel to the hyped up radiant system. bethesda are forver making leaps and bounds in the audio/visual departments of their games but the writing could have been stronger, specially for the dark brotherhood side story and the companions quest line. several dungeons feel copy-pasted in their environments but what stray from the beaten path turn out to be absolutely stunning. bethesda have tried their best to remove back tracking from dungeons by adding frequently used shortcuts from the end rooms, which are useful when you reach the dungeon chest and are close to carrying capacity and need to sell what loot youve already hoarded. mods add a ridiculous amount of replayability to this game, just like they do for all other bethesda open world games, and with a very active community still modding over two years past release date youll never run short of silly, fun and even professional looking user-made content to renew your interest in this game.",298.7

"loved skyrim, to this day i still find this to be one of the best games ever made. the game does an amazing job of making the world feel alive. there is a problem with enemy and friendly ais, but these were easily fixed with mods. speaking of mods, i think we should consider the amount of work people have put into making the wonderfully crafted content for this game. it speaks volumes of the love put into this game by the player community, and the foresight by bethesda to make the game so easy to manipulate. this game is proof that some developers still care about the players and not just the money from sales.",87.7
"good fantasy game with a good main story but even if the main vases vases pib get tired you can do side quests like to join a guild to kill someone or zvate hunt for fun but now the game has bags like that you piece-figure bugno the rocks or that it will kill an animal but otherwise very good game! i recommend",191.8

"what can i say about skyrim... its a great fantasy game on its own, with plenty of hours of slicing, smashing, stabbing, casting, stealing, questing, cooking, reading, and exploring to fill your time. the real gem in skyrim is its mod community though, it adds hours and hours of content to the already massive game, making it definitely worth the money.",125.1

"this game is brilliant, the graphics are decent in vanilla but when you install mods it looks amazing. the story is good but the ending to the main questline is a disappointing. highly recommend this game to rpg lovers, there is a few bugs from time to time but mods can fix that. overall 9/10.",1080.5
"i have played all the chapters of the elder scrolls series and i can safely say this is the best one ever. even more, this is the best action rpg full stop. great choice of races, the chance to evolve the character to suit your fighting style (long/short range weapon/magic) and an immense open world to explore. the main quest will entertain for many hours however it is easy to go over the 200 hours just by exploring and completing the side quests. the scenery is very detailed however the entire game can become basically life-like with the help of mods. the steam workshop makes adding/removing/creating them very easy. the community behind this workshop will bring new material almost every day. currently i run the game with over 20 mods and i never experienced a crash. i would definitely recommend this game not only to fans of the series, but to anyone who is even remotely interested in pc gaming, thanks",211.6

"building on the previous titles, its extended what we already know and love about elder scrolls titles and brought them to the current stage of gaming. while losing out on several amazing aspects from the previous titles (stats and character building), it does add a perk system that adds depth to the previously empty skill system. leveling only rewards health, magicka, or stamina now in order for brain damaged call of duty  to not be confused by stat allocation, as well as one perk point for skills. skyrim is a massive province in itself, finish the game twice, and on a third play, youll still find things you never saw the first time. and as usual, player made mods add infinite expandability to the game.",339.7

"really fun, really open. the only thing i wasnt too happy about was the good/bad split wasnt always right. every action was a little bit good and a little bit bad in weird ways, and it always felt like there should be other options that the game simply didnt even acknowledge. there was no option to buy out the assassins guild to take out the blackbriars and liberate riften, or reach the top of the thieves guild, and use that to curb their excesses and teach them not to s%@1 where they eat. the game, vanilla, is still like hundreds of hours of awesome fun, and then the steam workshop makes it easy to add hundreds more.",75.0

"what can i say about skyrim that hasnt already been said. it was outstanding when it first game out and a worthy sequel for the other elder scrolls. the graphics, sadly, though mind blowing at the time have obviously dated but the complex story lines and huge array of quests gives it such replayability. i havent stopped playing it since it first came out and i dont see a future where i stop either.",41.6
"just killed a dragon and absorbed its soul bandits still think they can kill me :3 10/10",564.3
"im not a huge fan of major lables removing features they claim as under used. while i definately have a lot of hours invested in skyrim, the game feels a bit stripped, and as always the combat is a bit outdated. thief classes always seem to excel in these types of games where warrior and mages struggle. the death animations you see in trailers rarely happen. i prefer to play the game in first person for total immersion, and often times the kill animations drop back to third person, killing the whole idea of immersion. i have a beast of a machine, and i can safely say this game is not optimized for pc. there are a lot of low-resolution textures that are completely unaccepatble for a game released in 2011. im eagerly awaiting the expansions in hope that they will re-add some old features from oblivion and morrowind. all in all, a great game, but its quite apparent that bethesda was too focused on the big picture, leaving the modding community to polish the details.",84.0
"very enjoyable and deep gameplay immersion. always something different to do as you can never be bored with this game. they made cheat codes for this game which can counter gliches or just make your character op.",344.1
"bethesda should be a role model for all game companies. i preordered the ce for 360 and picked it up midnight 11/11/11. i had a blast, but it was only holding me over until i could build my own pc that could play it with maxed out graphics. this game was the reason i built my $1300 pc back in may. well, this and ffxiv. i have absolutely no regrets(ffxiv did get better over time haha.). if you needed me to type this in order to convince you to buy the game, then shame on you. seriously. this game is amazing on 360, but the pc version with the modding community is what makes this one of the best games ive ever played. build or buy a pc if you have to, but get this game on pc! youll be missing out on so much if you dont. if i still havent convinced you enough to get this game yet(youre sick!) then get tes iv: oblivion goty edition for pc and try that game out while using mods. the modding community is still going strong for both oblivion and morrowind. i still play a little bit of oblivion to this day. the elder scrolls games are one of the few games that will last you probably at least a decade. every cent put into buying one is worth it. get this game!",277.2

"the mods available for this game, make it a much better experience on pc. better textures, more sounds, incredible immersion on top of the incredible job the game did already. quite simply a must-have for any rpg fan.",70.6
"this game is an amalgamation of all the game design experience and story telling expertise that bethesda has gathered over the years. this game is dense with adventure and contains copious amounts of polish on almost every level. i couldnt reccomend this game more!",516.8
"excellent game : ) spent to many hours in the world of skyrim :p",210.3
"the next xhapter in the elder scroll epic. a superb game with almost unlimited replay value and hundreds of hours worth of gameplay. as open and free form rpgs go, this game has it all.",64.1

"as good as an elder scrolls game is supposed to be!",189.9
"with the exception of the other elder scrolls games, and a few games from bioware, i feel that skyrim is the definitive singleplayer rpg experience gaming has to offer this far. what is most remarkable about skyrim and other elder scrolls games, is that it is completely unliniar. you never have to complete the main quest and will most likely never finish all the side content either. you are free to do as you wish, and bethesda has created an enjoyable and believable world for you do enjoy yourself in, completely.",137.0
"play it, notice theres something you dont like, mod it, play it... rinse and repeat dear god this game is entertaining",135.6
"i gotta give this game a thumbs up. ive been a fan of the elder scrolls series since i first played morrowind. i was a little skeptical of this game at first since i got used to the way your skills and leveling up worked in morrowind and oblivion, but the leveling system in this game works well. also, you dont have to have a ridiculous pc to run it. im running the game on medium settings just fine with an amd athlon ii x2 255 processor 3.10ghz, 4gb ddr3 ram, galaxy geforce 9500gt, under windows 7 pro. even just running at medium settings, the environments and characters look great.",149.7
"what can i say about this gme that hasnt already been said. this game is a fun, addictive rpg, that will eat up all of your time",96.9
"is good, highly customisable too. does wonders for immersion, especially if youre into more old-schoolish rpgs.",246.4
"i started playing hide and seek with a little girl, when it was my turn to hide i left the city and never came back. 10/10",53.2
"best elder scrolls out in my opinion. i played oblivion which was awesome at the time, but then i played skyrim. i was amazed. full of non-stop action, and also has a couple of puzzles and interesting things to find out. defo worth tha money. and if you like these games and graphics are not a problem 2 u (you are not botherd if they are not as good) you should try oblivion( iv ) and morrowind ( iii ).",131.6
"writing a review for skyrim is exceptionally hard. where do you start? well you start by saying the game is amazing and a must own, with all the mods you can get for any need. the story of skyrim may not be groundbreaking or something to remember that doesnt mean the game is not fun. i definitely recommend this game to anybody who likes rpgs or anybody whos a fan of the previous elder scrolls games. the modding community is something everyone should be part of, every day it keeps growing to make skyrim even better and with workshop integration it makes it even easier.",21.4
"this game influenced me; i now try to move stuff and people by shouting. i love it!",16.7

"this game influenced me; i now try to move stuff and people by shouting. i love it!",16.7
"the most recent and arguably best addition to the elder scrolls series, skyrim takes you to an immense world where you can fight monsters, rob houses, or court some of the loveliest ladies (or men, if you swing that way) on the continent. if you finish up with all the quests, which is unlikely, you could download or make a mod on the workshop, and play some more. this is the kind of game you should buy if youre looking for length in a single-player game.",61.5
"amazing game! not quite sure why i left it so long to give it a try! worth every penny!",123.5
"this game is worth paying money if you played xbox version this is waay better because you can get mods and it makes it way more fun",191.8
"best rpg game to date. all elderscrolls are worth buying!",194.0
"a great fun game with lots of content. its awesome.",6.4
"again, why am i writing a review? who does not like skyrim?",121.6
"i have over 500 hours total playtime on this game. time well spent!",226.6
"this game is really worth to play. it is very good rpg.",4.3
"not worth the time and the price, repetitive, and it gets boring near the late game, i had to swap my character so i wouldnt be bored but this game is a waste of time and money",243.5
"amazing game that, when including mods, has near infinite play time value",501.7
"do you like getting really zoned, and being a great dragonborn warrior who murders the innocent, kills dragons for lulz, and being super immersed into a huge fantasy world? well look no further cause this is badass sim 2012.",78.4
"i really cant say any more than everyone else already has. skyrim is a great base game that turns into an unstoppable, near-perfect monster with enough mods. the only bad thing about it is its time consuming. if you work a lot, like i do, you probly wont be able to play it as much as you would like if you enjoy variety (and sleep) with your gaming. easy 10/10",128.5
"omg this is the best game ever!!!!! im so attached",100.2
"great rpg. worth hours of playtime and the mods add much more to the game.",19.0
"i highly recommend this game to anybody who loves good graphics modable games and rpgs this is the best youll find but sometimes the game may have problems with mods and will crash like mine is currently and i cant fix it",52.7
"absolutely amazing. can spend a lot of time in this game and never get bored with it. especially with all the downloadable mods.",49.7
"now that the modding community has matured with this game...a careful selection of mods brings this game into the a+ category for me. thank you modders!!",1080.7
"basically an action game, where you try to find and kil whatever has a white arrow on the top.",137.8
"quite simply the best elder scrolls game yet. bethesda have done a good job of balancing a continuing rich and immersive storyline without treading on the heels of oblivion by setting it far enough in the future that the events of the past game still have influence, but are ultimately left fuzzy so that players fill in the blanks. oh, and its the sexiest game of its kind in terms of the sheer graphics, which upcoming mods will no doubt improve even more",433.1
"openworld dragon slaying at its finest. also, mods! replayability is infinite.",708.8
"a very very good game. completely worth the money.",157.1
"absolutely amazing game with nearly infinite gameplay. although bethesda went with quantity over quality here, it doesnt take away from the fun that can be found in endless hours wasted on an outstanding game.",52.5
"a little girl came to me and said hey, i found this. i thought you might like it. and gave me a bottle of wine. 10/10",116.8
"ok, skyrim is the greatest game that i have ever bought. it is extremely addictive because of how huge the world is and how amazing the gameplay is. this game is not that laggy at all and the actual gameplay is great, i love the combat (especially sneaking). the wide variety of creatures that you can battle also makes this game great. some of this game is realistic (apart from the dungeons and dragons type of stuff). thankyou for taking your time to read this and happy gaming ;p",193.6
"this game is one of the best ive played in a very long time. the content in this game is so massive that you will probably end up playing over 200+hrs if you want to complete all the quests. 5 out of 5 stars!!",137.1
"where do i even begin with this game? incredible depth, attention to detail, exploration, storyline... the game is simply incredible and does not disappoint. elder scrolls continues to be an epic saga of open-world games that will go into the hall of fame for best games ever.",102.9
"ever wanted to waste more time in one game than in real life.",16.1
"just started, amazing and beautiful!!! go get it!!!",11.4

"this game is pretty awesom... is all bout i like... hopefully every one would play this game...",2.0
"so many hours of gameplay, no wonder im not doing too well in school hahaha!",101.6
"this is one of the greatest open world games of all time. bethesda is a master of building a breathing world with some decent combat mechanics, always interesting story-lines. im not sure it quite reaches the heights of oblivion or fallout 3, but damn if it isnt a really good time all the same. if you like this game, be sure to go play fallout 3, and try out oblivion. oblivion may feel a bit dated in ways but its an incredible game as well.",107.9
"[+]  the best rpg game ever  seriously big and open world with some npcs  a lot of mods due to which change game  fus ro dah... yeah. x) [-]  i didnt find any minuses --- 10/10",118.4
"fantastic. im at 76 hours played right now, and have no idea if im even remotely close to being finished. the level of immersion in this game is insane, and while it may seem to start off a bit slow, it gets so good so fast. buy it!",158.6
"just an epic game and with workshop items you have well over 1000+ hours of nonstop adventuring. its well worth the money you spend.",83.3
"best immersive-game ive ever played. i recommend to mod it to the fullest and play the game.",534.6
"awesome game:d so much to do and the mods are great :p",10.0
"game is definitely one of the best i have played, especially when dlcs and mods are used. oblivion is probably better in terms of elder scrolls game but definitely give this game a go if youve never played it before.",656.1
"no words can describe how awesome this game is. i spent 100 hours into this game i have not beaten it yet. this game deserves all the hype and more. glitches and bugs be damned!",127.5
"great game! lots to do with tons of mods. money well spent if you are into rpgs.",40.2
"elder scrolls continues its tradition in being the golden standard of what a true rpg should be. they listened to gamers on this one. they removed what we hated, and improved upon all that we loved. the graphics are top-notch, the mechanics are fluid and easy to learn, but hard to master, the music is immersive, and the storyline is epic! but most importantly: no matter what you do in skyrim you will have fun! this game will not punish you unjustly, and more often than not rewards you for your actions (good or bad). if you like rpgs, buy this game. now. stop reading this. go!",325.2
"this game has almost everything. when you add the free workshop content, it can be anything! you can even make it into a game like the sims if you wanted to (though im not sure why you would want to). i dont have a lot of time on record but ive been playing obscene amounts on my xbox before i bought it for pc. thats right. its so good that i bought it twice.",134.9
"great combat system and really fun mods exist for this game that has some amazing name recognition.",388.7
"i got stabbed for killing a chicken. you cant do that in call of duty.",313.9
"this game is an example of how a game should be, skyrim is a game that is near perfect in every aspect. please, we need a new elder scrolls game (eso blew) co-op would be really cool(forget about mmo, it wont work)",1087.5
"my favorite open world rpg of 2011-2012. will propably keep you busy for +50 hours",77.0
"well where do i begin. the elder scroll skyrim is easy the best game ive ever played, although im not the most hardcore reviewer in the world, its an excellent game, and you should buy it if you dont have it already. you get an excellent rpg experience with an open world environment and hours apon hours of content, and thats without the dlc or any mods. mods is what really makes this game shine. the modding community on both nexus and steam workshop are both excellent, and bursting with content for you to enjoy. like i said before, if you havent already, buy this game.",92.8
"one of the best rpgs i ever played and probably even will play. though gameplay progressed only a little bit from the elder scrolls iii: morrowind and graphics requirement may be a little bit too much, its still one of the most sophisticated, gorgerous and surprising games out there. conclusion: a true epos about brave men, beautiful women and legends about dragons, f#%* yeah! what else do you need? 5/5",2.7
"the elder scrolls v : skyrim is one of the best games i played in 2013, possibly the most immersive and addicting game ive played as far as i know right now. its been 3 years already and i still have more dungeons to delve, trolls to slash and bandits to shout off cliffs. i definitely reccomend this as a 10/10 game!",512.4
"what is best in life? to crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women. crom!",186.6

"i have played countless hours of this on consoles and i was in love with this game but it got really dry once i beat the game. well with the wonderful mod community on here and nexus this game is like brand new! i suggest the frostfall mod with ineed immersive armors enhanced blood and of course the sxp and the random begining (so you dont have to spend all the time going through the first mission and it also a level of difficulty because it can start you anywhere in skyrim!) mods and this is the perfect setup for endless amounts of skyrim fun!",14.4
"its a good game,on sale most of the time,so buy it if you dont have it.also,oversexualized mods everywhere!!",93.4
"well, hell. let me just put it this way...there is absolutely no reason not to own this game, unless you just hate rpgs in fantasy settings that much. expansive plot, plenty of exploration, forboding dungeons, dynamic combat, hairy nordic warriors (and hot nord warrior chicks)....pure distilled fun, in other words. anyone who doesnt like skyrim is an enemy of fun. period. 10/10",141.5
"i hope youve got a good excuse as to why you havent bought this yet. since this game has reached new levels of awesome. i havent played as much as id like on pc, my only excuse is because ive been playing it on the xbox 360. even with elder scrolls online round the corner its still worth purchasing. i recommend trying to pick up the legendary edition on disk as its sizeable for a download. the 3 dlcs make a nice touch too and with nicer graphics, a mod community and smoother running (based on your pc), i highly suggest picking this up on pc even if you didnt need persuading from the others. now please save yourself the trouble and pick this up.",214.9
"im not a huge fan of major lables removing features they claim as under used. while i definately have a lot of hours invested in skyrim, the game feels a bit stripped, and as always the combat is a bit outdated. thief classes always seem to excel in these types of games where warrior and mages struggle. the death animations you see in trailers rarely happen. i prefer to play the game in first person for total immersion, and often times the kill animations drop back to third person, killing the whole idea of immersion. i have a beast of a machine, and i can safely say this game is not optimized for pc. there are a lot of low-resolution textures that are completely unaccepatble for a game released in 2011. im eagerly awaiting the expansions in hope that they will re-add some old features from oblivion and morrowind. all in all, a great game, but its quite apparent that bethesda was too focused on the big picture, leaving the modding community to polish the details.",84.0
"amazing game, endless hours of fun. with the addition of the add-ons and mods, this game is simpily the greatest.",95.9
"skyrim is filled with riches, and incredibale gameplay along with such a beautiful world full of life and peace along with danger to venture on. elder scrolls v: skyrim is among my best and favorite top 5 rpg games! after putting a full 220 hours of gameplay, starting from 11/19/11 up to this day, 6/6/12. i am still discovering new areas, items, characters, quest, and much more! i love this game, and i strongly reccomend this to anybody! rpg lover or not, its completley worth it! 10/10 ___________________________________________________________ ///////////////////////////////////////////////// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <><><><>the protectors blades of approval<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ///////////////////////////////////////////////// ____________________________________________________________",551.6

"skyrim is a great game, but it suffers from a lack of intersting quests and places to go to. the overworld is great, but absolutely everything else is shallow in comparison to the world in oblivion. oblivion whilst having some horrible dialogue and poor implementation of the radiant ai for npcs that was so touted, had fantastic cities, dungeons, and an incredible array of interesting quests. some of which sound incredible when compared to skyrim. example: in oblivion you are tasked with attending a house party where you must assassinate each guest one by one without the other guests knowing. quite a bit of fun, with an optional bit that also allows you to flex your silver tongue when people start accusing you. in skyrim you are told of an island where people hunt each other down for sport. so. you must go to a cave filled with dragurs exactly like the one you went through at the beginning of the game to get the prize money. the imagination is just gone. id highly reccomend it. but id reccomend oblivion over it, and morrowind over that.",130.1
