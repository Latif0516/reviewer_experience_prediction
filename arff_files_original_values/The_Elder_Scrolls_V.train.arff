"killed a chicken and now the whole town wants my head 10/10",144.4
"( i started playing skyrim on xbox, i have 1,000,000,000 hours gameplay ) to start, this is the best game that you will ever play! if you are like me and you started playing oblivion and started not exactly knowing whats going on this few months down the line you start to get it then you have brought this game and it feels like you have just had sex with asa akira. well if your new to tes then i would start playing previous games to get the understanding of the game but if not you dont nessercerly need to because every game is so amazing and has its own style, but this game completely took away my life... full of quests... you will never complete this game... main story line could have been longer but it is still my favourite story line of any game and just the general size of the map is just great! if you dont know what tes is about and you just want to use a bow and shoot someone in the face, or push someone off the edge of a mountain or try overcome your phobia of spiders then this is the game for you! you can do what you like when you like! its everything you imagine it to be! but please this taken away my school life and social life! this is really worth 10 its the best game in the world!",21.0
"this is a great game. you can add mods but even with out mods it has unlimted things to do.",18.1
"i had hundreds of hours of gameplay invested in skryim on my 360. now i have it for computer and im still playing strong. easily my favorite game so far. i dont see myself stopping anytime soon.",166.3
"never thought that there would be a game who can excite me as much as the elder scrolls iv oblivion, but bethesda did it again and made a much more awesome game. the game is nice itself, but you can get the most beatuy out oft it with mods. and because of the skyrim community there are more than enough out there for it.",597.1
"scrub game for scrub players. 0/10 would not bang.",29.0
"make waifus and husbandos and go hunt wolves and draugr in this epic tundra simulation.",1070.4
"this is a great game to play. if you dont have the game to play, get money for it. if you dont have the money for it, get a job. if you dont have a job, rob a bank. if you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried. #alduingetsrekt",406.1
"bethesda somehow just keeps making the elder scrolls series more and more amazing with each game. this is one series of game that i seriously pray will still be around far, far into the future.",173.3
"skyrim is a lovely game. i dont love it as much as i love fallout 3 (my favorite) but it has that wonderful open world feeling, and its a joy to grind through the game at your own pace taking on as many or as few side quests as you want. eventually your character is godlike, which is common in most games, and then the entire terrain takes on a new less threatening feeling, youre no longer a stranger exploring it, you are its owner and you are commanding skyrim. its beautiful, and crack rock addictive. a+ game.",60.6
"skyrim is a first/third person game in wich you can use a variety of weapons against hordes of powerful foes. think of any fps such as cod or blackops, then add tastefulness. dont get me wrong, im not saying theyre bad games, but they lack a true purpose or rich back story. skyrim has everything one could want. some nice features: no matter what race you play, you can be any class. the whole game is hand-drawn beautifully. you can play any combination of classes, change class mid play, play multiple classes. several long and detailed yet continually engaging questlines to follow and guilds to join. do whatever you want. a wide community is availabe to help you and discuss game topics. extensive mod support.",93.0
"skyrim is a great i can spend hours playing it lvling up and just romaing the towns. i like a lot of the mods that come out for the game as well makes playin a whole lot more fun and keeps me into the game.",38.4
"with nude-mod this game is great! without nude-mod its ok.",29.8
"this game will make you realize how tremendously boring it is to be a human being on the planet earth. purchase this game at any cost. everyone in real life is uninteresting. also, parthunax (sp?) reminds me of my grandfather but with less gas.",385.5
"this game can live up to every expectation you would ever have, even if there are a few bugs and glitches, skyrim is probably the best open world game i have ever played, an open world where you can explore cities, dungeons and learn to use magick, all i can say is well done bethesda.",360.6
"this game is amazing! not much time spent on it but still it is great i got it for sale on christmas and it was so worth it. i had it for xbox 360 but it is so much better on pc. awesome replay value and the mods will never stop being created best  evar!",41.2
"this is the first game that i completed while still naughty and decided that hard work deserves to be paid. every so often i uninstall this game thinking thats enough. no more skyrim for me. three weeks later ill re-install it and load up the million mods. its so relaxing to just wander throughout the province looking at and killing things. i keep buying new games and none of them grab me and pull me under as much as skyrim does.",829.5
"whats there to say about skyrim? it is, in my personal opinion, one of the best open-world rpgs ive ever played; the world truely feels alive. there are only a handful of other sandbox games i can think of that have had an open-world as alive as skyrim. you can wander about skyrim for hours, constantly discovering something new no matter where you go. ive played the game quite a bit on the 360 prior to getting skyrim on the pc, and am still finding new things i never encountered before. its easy to get lost taking in the sights of skyrim, and it is worth every cent it costs to play the game, given the huge amount of content.",103.6
"so i played this game for 300 hours on ps3. i stopped because the load times became unbearable. at times it took a full minute to go from inside of a house to the basement. playing this game again on pc remedies most of the problems i experienced on ps3 plus i get to play it in 1080p60+fps. i love this game. i love the fact that despite me doing my best to redo what i did in the last game i coming across new content in the same old places. if youre looking for a game thats long, dense, and filled with variety then this is the game for you.",173.7
"i had waited for about 4 years for this game to lower the prices and i saw he special for 20$ i was amazed.the gameplay is amazing gamemaking at its best 100000/10 i would recommend this to all best game cant wait for the next",146.6
"my most played game, must return to playing... and its dawn!!! i am the dragonborn!!!",63.9
"this is the best game ive ever played, by far. its so deep and theres so much you can do. 130 hours in, i ran out of big questlines to do and now ive been clearing all the dungeons i skipped over earlier in the game and redoing some old ones. with mods, the game can look like it was released last week, not over 3 years ago. also i hate the thalmor.",168.7
"played this on xbox. probably over 200 hours... yeah im a nerd. great game tho.",0.7
"when i first heard of skyrim i didnt think it was anything special. but i decided to try it to see what all the hype was about, and boy am i glad i did. it was just so revolutionary to me, i had never ever played anything like it. the open world, the awesome quests, the armor and crafting, everything was perfect. and when i thought i was done with the game, i found a beatiful thing by the name of steam workshop. skyrim has an insane amount of replay value and will be played by gamers for many years to come, even after elder scrolls vi is released. i could not recommend this game enough, it is just so damn great. i rank this game as my second all time favourite and i give it a 10/10.",154.3
"best game that i`ve ever bought , you never get bored of this game , i strongly recommend thsi game!",63.5
"this game is great. i got it on my ps3 a couple years ago and now i got it on my pc during the autumn sale, and my addiction has been revived. i have roughly 40 hours and i got it only 3 days ago.",110.7
"very immersive environments and story lines. especially great playing in 3d. very unique gameplay from one individual to another. highly recommend it.",22.9
"best game ive ever played this is a must for anyone rpg loving gamer",324.2
"this game is very very good i always loved the tes series but this is amazing. and it has a wide modding community ;d",55.5
"this game is amazing. i dont really need to sing its praises. since its 50% off today, i would entirely recommend picking it up if you can spare $30.",194.8
"killed a chicken and everybody in the town tried to kill me to revenge the chickens death. i died. 11/10, game of the century.",20.6
"i really enjoyed the pc version of skyrim, mainly because of the mods availabe on the workshop. even without mods, this game is still soooooo much fun to just mess around on. if youre looking for a game where you can spend hours upon hours on then skyrim is a good buy. it is also really great for its value, if you ever get bored (somehow) then visit the skyrim workshop for some mods to spice up your game. i hope this review helped :d",241.5
"skyrim is pretty amazing, but if you have a slow computer the experience is ruined. its a great game though, especially if youre into fantasy stuff.",4.1
"amazing rpg you can do basically anything and explore everywhere and mod support which means doing anything and going anywhere is literal",316.4
"great game. completed it originally on the console, and now got it cheap on a sale through steam for old-times sake. no doubt will enjoy ploughing hours into this again, especially with all the dlc i didnt have before. would echo some other reviews and comments that the engine they used is certainly dated now, and mechanics are a bit clunky, but who really cares if it plays good. i mean, fez is brilliant and that just a bunch of old-school pixels.",1.2
"this game is the bomb. 10/10 would buy this. kill dragons get money.",72.0
"anti-chicken abuse simulator 2014 10/10 would play again",51.0
"fantastic game, as to be expected from bethesdas elder scroll series. dont take my word on it, play it for yourself. i doubt you will regret it.",117.3
"i keep getting errors and cant play it.. i love this game so much but its just not working for me!",41.4
"i would play thousands of hours of this game. if i didnt keep corrupting my saves with 50+ mods.",272.3
"i just purchased this game for the p.c. i have spent a few hundred hours in it on the xbox 360. it is easily one of the best games ive ever played. it is also the best elder scrolls.",32.7
"i learned about pickpocketing and abused it until i maxed it. now all the guards are naked. 10/10",198.5
"a sickness is upon this game, dragon sickness this game is a sickness. its like dragon sickness. like the thrain. you become a monster with this game. you will play it like 5 hours , then you gonna say yourself, i want to drink a cofee. while drinking cofee, you will just think about skyrim. while going to school/work etc. you will only think about skyrim. skyrim will be everything to you. you gonna love it and at the same time you gonna hate it. its like the one ring . this is the one game to rule all gamers. it will destroy your real life. in real world, you gonna think, i dont belong here , i belong to skyrim. and also skyrim belongs to the nords, dont forget that. and one last think: if you want to live in real world, if you have a good social life and a happy family life, do not play this game! this game will make you crazy! you can do whatever you wanna do in skyrim. even you can make your own world. you can mod everyting.(until it crashes.d) anyway i spent too much time writing this , i must return to skyrim ,alduin must be waiting for me . have fun.",107.0
"great attempt. but, fail. ive spent more time trying to fix the issues i have with the game instead of playing it. game-breaker=micro stutter on a brand new asus rog g750. have tried hours and hours of research and changes, tweaks, mods.... conclusion, not worth your time. tons of better games out there with fewer bugs and problems.",85.5
"so much to do in this game, way more than oblivian & fallout 3 combined - swear !. totally fun and totallty addictive - first single player rpg ive really enjoyed in a long time. basically i spent 48 hours playing this and i think half of that time was sidequests. just by looking at how much i skipped, i did roughly 1/3 of all the quests and beat it at level 27. you can go back and continue doing the rest of the quests after beating it... but then again you can just re-roll a new char, take different skills, and do a bunch of different quests. i feel pity for anyone who is a 100% competion person... this game would be brutal. i totally recomend this game, if i didnt have a dozen other games to play: i would re-roll a new char right now.",53.7
"amazing, adventurous game with a few glitches and bugs.",114.8
"pros: -an endless supply of quests. -very beautiful graphics. -workshop support. -dragons! ing dragons! -a lot of skill perks. -argonians and khajiit look amazing compared to other elder scroll games. -dragon shouting that makes things fly and die. -achievements. -jzargo! <3 cons: -too laggy sometimes. -contains a  ton of glitches. -freezes a lot. -crashes a lot. -takes forever to load and sync. -arrow to the knee jokes. if you like singleplayer rpgs, and you havent played this one yet, then id recommend that you try it out. just make sure you have a powerful pc, or else youll get a lot of lagging, freezing and crashing. 8/10.",635.4
"the modding is so insane that you end up spending most of your time modding instead of playing the game. 10/10 would mod again",143.2
"no words can describe how awesome this game is. i spent 100 hours into this game i have not beaten it yet. this game deserves all the hype and more. glitches and bugs be damned!",127.5
"wonderfully detailed game. a must have for any elder scrolls fan.",712.8
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",69.3
"best sandbox game ive played since fallout 3. pros: got me through multiple  new england winters without gaining 25 pounds in delivery calzone weight. cons: i used to have a life until i took an arrow in the knee.",340.1
"if u like open world games and midivil time games download his game great story great graffics and great enemies",34.6
"dear god how i love this game... i now know why my friends are so addicted to this game and why i hardly never see them on anything else, this game is amazing, i have to set my graphics to low but even then, the graphics are incredible. i cant wait to get my gaming pc in the next few years and ramp this to the highest settings. a must buy 11/10",37.9
"tthe best game in the whole world skyrim is one of the most configurable games ive ever played",41.3
"i have killed countless dragons, trolls, i have saved the world from being eaten by the king of all evil, wait, is that a bear? nononono, screw that. im out. *flies off on thomas the tank engine, god i love mods.*",225.9
"skyrim is incredible if you put some good mods like hellspire and club obos and of course lovely companions like caele (its [kei-lee], get it??? kei. lee.. you casul) and anduniel. also dont forget to visit loverslab for instructions about making your character beautiful (i recommend going full nexus). and most important: sexlab is mandatory for most immersive skyrim experience.",289.0
"it is a good game that you can never stop the game play is great and it is practiclly never ending thins game is the best rpg i have ever played and i highly recomend it",91.3
"this game is the fifth in a series, and although i have never played and previous games in the series, i found it enjoyable, and had no trouble understanding the story or characters. having first completed the game on a console, i liked the new idea, of adding new quests and items, from the steam workshop.",10.1
"i have played tes:4 oblivion and at that playthrough i was amazed about the details that game had. next rpg game that i played is dragon age: origins that bored me from rpg genre. many years later i found my rpg game that has long play time, cool and a lots of features. not the mention skyrim has infinite potential at modding which adds more play time to game. so far this is best rpg game ever made in 2010s. i can guarantee that just exploring skyrim with dlcs needs at least 80 hours of gameplay.",51.5
"best game ever if u dont have it get it or dieeeee!!!!",188.5
"this game is amazing. this game has a lot of activitys to do in the game. skyrim has very little bugs. this is a must buy game",38.6
"i love this gae, always will love this game loved all the games before going to love the next and final couple of games :) recommend this to all of you guys out there",75.4
"this game is like a very voluptuous redhead woman across the table that caught your eye.. you know you want to play with her forever",140.3
"this game influenced me; i now try to move stuff and people by shouting. i love it!",16.7
"the right way to customize your own fantasy epic...and, yes, kill monster and grab the money!",144.2
"this is an amazing game and i reccomend it to anyone who likes mideval fantasy books/games.",126.8
"best gaming experience ever! not as good as the story in morrowind, but still a darn good one. however, the vanilla graphics suck but can be enhanced with mods, created by the massive mod community of skyrim and basically all bethesda games. everything about the lore and immersiveness has driven me to addiction over this game. 10/10",230.5
"if i only had one single player video game to play, ever again, this would probably be it.",149.5
"this game is highly reccomended my me and alot of other sources. the possibilities are endless as to how to create your character and choice of path you take to play the game. the main story will always be there, so if you decide to stray away and discover the world or complete side quests or just discover uncharted land, come back a month later and the main line will be there to complete. on this versoion ( pc ) i have minimal hours put in. on the ps3 and xbox 360 i have hundreds and still play the game in new light. do your self a favor and play this game, you wont regret it. :)",17.1
"no other singleplayer could steal so much of my life than this game. it is absolute outstanding. some may say that it is kinda old engined and just a rip off from oblivion / fallout. but that may stand for the base game. what every tes really makes the game the players want is the mod support. with mod you make of skyrim an entire different game with textures where even crysis may be jealous. now buy the legendary edition while it ins on sale and i promise you that you will not regret it.",380.5
"i have lost way too many hours on this game. it is fun, engaging, and with the modding options, almost limitless play time... worth every single moment",122.1
"skyrim, the 5th instalment on the elder scrolls series. after completing it on console, and moving to pc, the game well out strips that of its console counter part in graphics, comunity and something that consoles dont have, mods.",56.5
"truely an amazing game, something all rpgs sould take note of.",226.9
"one hellavu gg! if you havent got it you need it!",133.2
"one of the best games ive ever played its fun to play you get nice achievments it has an emmersive storyline rooting into the other games of the series like oblivion and plenty of gret mods to boot on my rating list 10 outta 10 great game",1111.6
"this game is great. was great until the bugs set in. this game is really fun and really addictive to play, theres a  ton to do and you can play how you want, but its buggy as . after a certain amount of time, actions started being really delayed or outright refused to work, for example the shout walls in the game which give you good abilities to make you more powerful started outright refusing to work, i can no longer gain these abilities because the game has ed out on me and i cant seem to fix it. the mods in the game manage to make the game at least 12 times more fun at least.",136.0
"this is the game thats so fun an addicting, that i bought it day of release on xbox 360, played it for three years, then quit xbox for pc, missed skyrim, bought legendary addition, and now playing it nonstop. this game is an all time best rpg only being beaten by oblivion and morrowind (which i also spent money on the dlcs on xbox and then bought on pc with all dlc)",43.2
"played through on 360, beat regular skyrim. playthrough 2 on ps3, dabbled in legendary, long way to go before complete. got legendary on pc, testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 play-throughs. especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to, ive done all these fn quests before, its great to be able to just go grab all the games keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your play-through without trivial bs. also, thomas the truck.  yeah. oh, one more thing, it looked good on 360. it looked great on ps3. it loads a billion times faster and plays way smoother on pc. got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience ive ever had.",13.3
"im a pc gammer so i had some high expectations from what i heard. when i started the graphics blew me away along with the similarities to games i own. the mining materials to make tools of minecraft and first person main perspective. the graphic of loz tp (wii) multiplied by 50. the set world size of maple story but longer to get between points without knowing were you are. the countless weapons and spells and summons and enchanted gear of fate. (its been years since ive played) the optinal 3rd person perspective like that of ratchet & clank. and im sure there are many many many other relatable small things. and thats all vanilla style. with the modding community i may find 1,000 more relatable games that i enjoy. and im sure you will too.",83.1
"seriously the best game of (whatever year it was released) modding it is easier than ever now using the steam workshop or the skyrim nexus tool which takes the boring bits out of modding (for the most part, some mods still need manual copying about and ini adjustments). cracking game, make sure its in your collection!",37.7
"what village are you from a? crips or die horse theif.",101.9
"a great addition to the elderscrolls library, even if it weighs a bit on the hand-holdy no-real-exploration-reward-besides-pretty front... btw, it is extremely pretty... google fimbulvinter enb, download it, use it.... also get better quest objectives (then turn off the compass and use a legit map with no markers), and then welcome in hundreds (literally) of hours of pure joy and rewarding fun ive played through both the xbox and this version of the game, logging hundreds of hours on both... its difficult to say any other single player rpg that is capable of that much content (besides other elderscrolls games) if you want this, or like rpgs at all, do get this",587.4
"i have been playing elder scrolls games for years now and i really enjoy them! the elder scrolls series have gotten better with each game and skyrim is no exception. ive spent hundreds of hours playing elder scrolls already and im not even close to finishing! i recommend all the elder scrolls games, but know there is a lot of combat. if you dont want your kids playing violent games at younger ages, then have them wait til they are older. good luck and great gaming!",882.0
"i am an adventurer, and sometimes i even endure an arrow to the knee..",72.6
"game becomes very boring to quickly.. everything you do feels half-farted & lacks any real purpose.",7.8
"very good! game of the year 2011. need i say more?",121.4
"great rpg, go where you want, kill who you want, steal what you want. the quest are great with a good story behind it (i dont do alot of story lines, not really a fan in any game). the combat seems like an improvement from previous elder scroll games. magic is fun to play around with but ill always use my trusty bow, the aim is right on, just hard to hit them flying dragons. skills are done nicely, if your an archer type, using bows alot, and wanna try 2 hand weapons, you dont have to make a new character, just start using 2 hand weapons with your archer and youll gain skill. since there is level ramping (enemies in the world level and scale up compared to what level you are) when you switch to using 2 hand weapons, you will notice a damage differance, but just keep using youll get your skill where it needs to be soon enough. its easy to get lost in doing side quest from the main story, as they randomly generate. over all, if you like alot of the elder scrolls and/or fallout series, youll love this. 9/10",341.4
"best rpg game ever its just heaven for rpg lovers suggesting all rpg game lovers - must play",25.8
"couple hundred hours later, still playing it. for those people who like to play long engrossing games, id recommend this title.",138.8
"you kill things, and never really get stronger but somehow feel you are getting stronger.",146.5
"this game is best played shirtless with a giant flagon of mead in hand.",325.7
"one of the things i look for in games is replay value - skyrim is no slouch in that department. the amount of content in this game is incredible - ive been playing this since it first released in 2011 and im still discovering quests and locations ive never found before. a single playthrough can easily log in excess of 100 hours, over 200 in some cases depending on your playstyle. it may not be the perfect game, but the ability to customise it with mods allows the community to shape the game: fix bugs, add new content, overall increasing the lifespan and enjoyment of the game. would i recommend this? any day of the week, without a doubt.",310.2
"go back and  urself dragon age, here comes the ture rpg!",44.2
"skyrim is not only a worthy successor to morrowind and oblivion, it is also just a fantastically fun game.",138.5
"you start out as a prisoner pending execution. i suggest patiently waiting in line to meet your fate. was amazing.",177.1
"amazing game in the depth and freedom that it allows you to enjoy! the sheer scale of the world and the random events keep everything fresh and there is always something happening or being discovered. perfect fantasy rpg! 10/10",535.0
"its nice until you realize just how empty and shallow it is.",127.1
"its not the best of the elder scrolls games, you have to mod it to hell to make it more enjoyable. from a elder scrolls game i would have exspected more, sadly this game has a lot of lazy coding, and many unfinished quests that just stop dead and and no explonation as to why things are, it lacks in story, game play and coding on its predosessors. however it is still fun to play, if you get many of the mods or even write you own you can make the game make sense and once again fun. its still better then many other games out there, but dont exspect what the hype makes you think its going to be, it scores a 5 out 10 with me, with mods it gets a 9.",506.9
"skyrim is an amazing game with a lot of replayablility. the vast amount of styles that you can play keeps you entertained for hundreds of hours, especially with mods. skyrim does have some bits that may annoy you from time to time but nothing groundbreaking. this game is truly a masterpiece and should be experienced by everyone.",347.4
"spawned 1000 sweetrolls in whiterun and got crushed by them 10/10 goty",283.6
"great game, and with the right mods it can have beautiful graphics and game mechanics!",88.6
"worst game in the world, i cant get past the first part wtfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff",0.5
"this is my all time favorite game! i already did a full play-thru on ps3 and couldnt stay away. this time around, i am experimenting with lots of great mods from the workshop. good times!",402.9
"with the newest update, or legendary edition, it makes modding the game almost impossible. i cant replace meshes as easily as i once did. if i could i would happily take the days of ole when bethesda did use ing bsas to  the game up.  you bethesda.",76.2
"lots to do. lots of exploration. tons of mods-can enhance just about everything if you so desire. main quest is decent. some of the factions arent quite as good, storywise, as they were in oblivion but they are still pretty fun. the combat and leveling is a bit better than previous games. nice perk/skill up system. overall a good game.",87.1
"after playing over 600 hours of this game, i can not only confirm it is a great game, but that i think it may be one of the best games ever made. it has flaws, quite a large number but it is easy to overlook these flaws in the search of an experience you will never find in other games. it is unique in atmosphere, and filled with great writing, besides the typical quests youll likely find here. if you enjoy fantasy games, and exploration then elder scrolls is definitely one to look at and play.",624.8
"my new hobby is to enter homes, murder everyone, and put together an elaborate crime scene to make it seem like all the food in the house came to life and massacred an entire family.",56.6
"i recommend this game because it is very much like tf2 and cs:go much good such wow 11/10 do not get use flams to brn",57.7
"the elder scrolls therum: the more you mod tes, the more likely you are to react as if its porn when someone catches you playing it. looking at you big- flame atronachs mod",234.0
"elder scrolls skyrim is an amazing game. i highly recommend it, if you enjoyed previous elder scrolls games, you will most likely enjoy this one, like the previous elder scrolls you were able to just wander off and do whatever you wanted via dungeon or find someone that need help and it turns out to be question. great game youll spend tons of time playing it",117.0
"in this obscure indie gem you make your own fun! a shallow core experience exists for those who dont want to mess with the technical side of mods, but a true gamer will add in tons of new content such as: -new character creation parts! -enormous breasts! -luchadore masks! -every memorable sword from the final fantasy series! -hyper-realistic eyes! -sex/ simulation minigames! -motorcycles! -professional wrestler companions! -battletoads! -fully-functional tanks! not into actual content? okay! other, less adventurous gamers can take advantage of lesser mods such as: -a ui that doesnt blow chunks! -third-person animations that look vaguely human! -improved sounds, meshes, textures, particle effects, and lighting! -bug fixes! honestly how can you afford not to own this game? do yourself a favour and discover this indie gem, and dont forget to tell all your friends!",25.4

"one of the best games ive ever played! you can put so many hours into this game without knowing. i recomend just starting off with no dlc or mods until you feel you know enough about the game (not story wise, but gameplay wise, because some mods can affect it). as for dlc, i would get dawnguard and work through that, then get dragonborn because dragonborn can mess things up a little (i may have killed all of riverwood because of some damn cultists). it doesnt really matter when you get hearthfire, but get it as it adds the nice touch of adopting some kids and making a hom for you and your family. enjoy :d (i know you will)",200.1

"the best part of skyrim is to abandon the story line as soon as you get outside - and just go wander about and do your own thing. enjoy the world and completely ignore the games main plot line. the main plot: you are a dragon soul trapped in some tiny biped body and you want to stop the dragons from taking over - well, that doesnt make sense at all. skyrim would only make sense if you are a dragon soul, duh, obviously you would want to 1. return to being a dragon, 2. restore the dragon religion 3. bring back all your dragon friends and take over the world once again. logically, you would begin by rescue missions to save the long dead dragon priests, and for all the faithful buried with theim - return them to full living breathing human state - no longer undead. find and help bring dragon bones back to life, rebuild the ruins and temples all over skyrim, and take over the towns - not destroy them. great game ! enjoy exploring - be sure to download all the graphics hi-rez updates.",785.6

"in skyrim you can be anything. im myself a thane of four holds who assists in the investigation of a murder while at the same time an assassin-thief who robs and kills and loots peoples bodies... and bribes the authorities when caught in the act. im also a proficient blacksmith and chemist (but sadly no one remembers me for that). in my spare time, id dive deep into caves to find hidden treasures of the region, slaying trolls and wolves and those plant-men spriggans and other hideous creatures. when i feel strong enough id take a hike up the tall, snowy hills to try my luck with the dragons but theyre mostly unfriendly so i slay them instead for their bones and scales for making weapons (and money) as well as their souls for learning the powerful spells of the dragons. skyrim, however, somehow gives me a feeling of loneliness as at times it feels so quiet. even in the big cities, the people feels cold and not so merry. they give me that odd, rigid stare when i walk past them. but maybe thats just me. its a really great game, though. i dont do this game justice by this lame- passage, but really, if i had to recommend only one game to someone, itd probably be skyrim.",98.8

"i heard someone call this a mile wide and an inch deep once, and thats a perfect way to describe it. bethesda is utterly amazing at building worlds, but when it comes to putting quests and characters in those worlds they fail, miserably. take the civil war for instance. skyrim is caught between the empire (the good guys) and the stormcloaks (idiots one and all, and the bad guys. if they win, the real big bads, the aldmeri dominion who are basically magical nazi elves get one step closer to wiping out humanity altogether.) you can win the civil war for one side or another, and.... nothing happens. sure some guards change pants and maybe two or three npcs say a sliiiiiightly different thing now, but thats it. oh and you win the civil war by doing a fetch quest and then going to a city and killing waves of utterly identical faceless soldiers. four or five times. i guess what im saying here is theres no replay value at all. theres one way to do something and thats it. no choosing to do it a different way later in another playthrough because there is no other way. oh and if you care about sane, coherent plots, do not buy dawnguard. the only possible way that could make sense is if your character literally becomes temporarily . full on window licking wearing inflatable waterwings in the bath so you dont drown .",516.7

(same with dragonborn dlc) 5. abilities: in skyrim you can cast magic (destruction spells, conjuration spells - my favorite- and more), have recreational skills (speech, smithing, etc...) or fighting skills (archery, one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons etc...) this game is truly remarkable. you should really consider buying it.",116.1

"skyrim is a game that is difficult to describe in words. it plays like a good book reads. after youve turned a few pages you forget youre holding a book in your hand, and the next time you look up its 0400 in the morning, youve needed the toilet for the last two hours and its almost time to get ready for work. real life just seems so much less important when youre riding a horse through the frozen wastes, or discussing politics with a guard who sounds suspiciously like arnold schwarzenegger. needless to say its an experience no one should miss.",217.9

"it seems long ago now, looking back, when this game was first released. i had played morrowind, i have played oblivion, loved both, and i was left eagerly awaiting skyrim. and i was not disappointed. bethesda again reminds me of what true quality is. in short, this game is amazing. but more that that, it gives everyone who would give it a chance, everyone that would allow themselves to gently fall into its landscape, a fantastical escape from the occasional blandness of life. we all need escapes, time away from the coffee and the concrete, and skyrim provides a window. its not a replacement for anything, its merely an avenue to get lost in your own imagination. those who cant let go, cant dream of fantasy, should avoid skyrim. for everyone else, i high recommend you give this game a try and give yourself a chance to get lost in its wonder.",269.6

"i discovered skyrim after hearing my buddies talk about it at college. i had never been into the rpg-style games, and was a bit unsure about whether or not i would actually enjoy it. boy was i wrong. the best part about this game is that, even after youve beaten the main quests (even on all the dlcs!), theres still so much more to do. whether you want to collect all the dragon priest masks, rack up infinite bounties in all the holds, or just mess around and throw buckets at people, skyrim offers a bajillion different options. and with mods, you can spend days - weeks, even - just messing around and having fun. probably the biggest compliment i can give this game is that it got my friend - who never played video games before and said that she thought they were lame - hooked. so well done, bethesda. maybe you should look back at this and try not to  up elder scrolls online so much.",255.1

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"really fun to play, one of the best games available. the only downside is that the enemies level matches our level, so we could get in a situation where the game is impossible to beat. for example, a lvl 40 pure wizard is really powerful, but if you then level up melee or some other skills, your magic abilities are not more powerful, but the enemies are harder to beat.",97.3

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"the latest installment to the elder scroll franchise (not counting online, as far as i know there are no provinces called online in tamriel), skyrim is a big and beautiful yes gritty and restricted take on the elder scrolls series. it keeps plenty of elements people gamers loved from the older games but refined it to be more convenient to the player (dual wielding, alchemy and leveling). i think skyrims biggest flaw (and possibly the only thing stopping me from entitling it better than oblivion) is that the quests just seem too generic. in oblivion you may be tasked to find a man who has been taken to an isolated island, used for hunting fun by other people, but the twist is after youve been sent to the island, you become the next victim. in skyrim, you may be told of a man who is trapped on an island being used as hunting fun by others, and you must go through a draugr infested cavern to get a specific item to get the guy back. overall an amazing game which i need to play more of, 8/10 would slay dragons again",114.0

"this is one of the buggiest, most broken, most unfinished-feeling games i have seen in a long time. it would take a very special game to make me look past all the (really glaring) issues and still have fun, and skyrim is one of those games. it captures the feeling of adventure, of exploration, of excitement over the smallest things, more than most any games ive ever played. wouldnt call it a masterpiece, but its most definitely worth your time and money. (plus the game is extremely moddable, so youre getting a potentially limitless amount of playthroughs without it feeling stale, not even mentioning the entirely new games people have made with the engine. bumps up the value quite considerably, in my opinion.)",144.1

"surely you mustve heard all the good stuff this game has to offer, yes? well dont go into this game expecting what youve heard. expect much, much more. every time your play skyrim youll notice something new. maybe a quest, item or even a simple little treat that either resembles something like an easter-egg, a whole set of missions, or even going on an adventure after a heavy night of drinking finding out what the hell you did in your drunkness the day after. the game is almost limitless! oh and i didnt even mention the dlc. hands down: the best dlc ive come across in any game so far (the only exception being bioshock infinite: buried at sea). 9.5/10, almost perfect. the absolute only flaw this game seems to have (on me at least) is that the game gets a bit repetitive. this can be fixed pretty easily however if you simply download some of the mods from the steam forum. i rated the base game but with the workshop included this is a perfect 10/10 solid title. buy it. do it nao! *plz episode 3 confirmed?*",86.6

"a classic. when i first played this game on xbox i loved it, but after about 90 hours into a single playthrough, i began to feel that it might be too big. what i came to understand after playing it agian on xbox and on pc now is that the insane amount of content in this game will insure future unique playthroughs, probably for years to come. freedom is the theme and freedom you have. there are so many systems that cater to your playstyle, and the combat is fun and can be challenging on higher difficulty levels. voice acting is excellent. the game is beautiful. youll catch yourself occasionally stopping to look out on top of a mountain over a vista and its gorgeous view. the soundtrack is amazing. jeremy soule outdid himself on this one. some of the finest classical pieces ive ever heard. beautiful sound to go with a beautiful game. the main storyline is solid and there are many side quests that arguably have as rich dramatic content. if you enjoy dark fantasy rpgs, the edler scrolls v: skyrim is a must play. this review does not do the game justice.",125.8

"i love this game. cons: npcs are ofter uninteresting and nothing to care about and the ui is bad but mods fixes the ui pros: everything else! it is an awsome game and can made into something beautiful. the amount of mods and user made content will give you the abillity to customise your experience to something uniqe. just take my advise and install skyui, skyrim skse, hd texture pack and an enb and it will be one of the best looking games ever.",390.6
"this game has a rich story and buetiful lore, with a great moding community. you can play for hours getting lost in the missions and get side tracked along the way. my suggestion to new players is this, you should explore the workshop to find some intersting graphic enhancers and gameplay modifiers to improve on the organily great game.then procede down the main quest line and never say i shouldnt do that random thing up ahead. because youll regret not finding that map location to fast-travel to, and its fun to pick up some extra loot. all in all its a magnificently addictive game and a great adition to the elder scrolls series.",208.9

"its a fun rpg. in fact im going to go play it now. right now.",544.0
"probably the best elder scrolls game to grace this earth. what i like most is the game does not punish you for playing against your character build. i started as a heavy armor fighter but later became more of a rouge and the transition was practically seamless. try that in any other rpg! love this game!",134.1

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"there are so many different ways to play this game, theres a ton of replay. ive sunk a ridiculous amount of time into my xbox 360 version. i recently purchased the pc version because i wanted the faster load times and better graphics. best purchase ever.",3.7
"coming from a guy who grew up on consoles and just starting expanding my interests into the pc gaming library. i must say. this is a huge inprovement to the console versions. the graphics and loadtimes are surperb. the game itself is still crack and i love the fact that theres these cool trading cards to collect. but the best part i will enjoy will be trying out the mods that i could never do on the console version. still a perfect 10 to me.",197.2
"great mods, huge map, midieval age like gta, tones of submissions, freely messing around, pick pockets, break into npcs house, kill the city guards, non-essential npcs being killed and their house is become to you. sh*t! this must be the best game i had ever played.",180.6
"this game is just amazing. vanilla or modded, the imagination you can have in this game is immense. you can play it however you want, but to fully enjoy it in my opinion, dont play it like a dungeon-crawler game. immersive yourself in the world and roleplay, its a role-playing game is it not...? my biggest love for this game is the freewill to do whatever you want to this game. its basically an open-world sandbox rpg. grab a ton of mods, and your experience will be different from others. the way i play this game wont be like everyone elses and what i enjoy, might not be for others. all in all, try to put yourself in the footsteps of your character and feel that youre in the amazing world of skyrim.",56.5

"will drain your life and soul while smiling at you.",123.1
"this game would be recommended for those who love to explore new places, kill many types of monsters, hell, even catch fish with your bare hands. what i find the mos hilarious though is that you could kill so many of the side quest givers that its kinda hard to murder entire cities of people (fyi- if you even want to tink about doing that you have to be lvl 20 or up and have a lot of potions, very srong armor, or have some strong healing spells or enchanted weapons), although thats the most fun part. skyrim can also be a good place to practice your family skills too, just abandon them and go questing for 20000000 years and come back when you remember you had one.",425.4
"i havent felt so addicted to a game in years. skyrims mammoth sized map and diverse game play options leave me always wanting to do more before i save & quit. the sheer beauty of the game graphically and the story line all combine to make one masterpiece of a game.",196.0
"even after already playing the game to death on the xbox 360, ive sunk a pile of hours into the game on pc without even trying. its a masterstroke of western rpg game design. so much so that its host of bugs and weirdness are seen as largely endearing by its players than the annoyance and frustration it would be in any other game. still years later, skyrim is worth playing and still compelling.",61.0
"what can i say, this is one of the alltime best soloplayer rpgs ever produced..",116.4
"breathtaking immersion, wonderful graphics, and endlessly fun gameplay makes this game a prize to own. there are some problems with it, though. to start with, the immersion is so complete, youre disappointed when a feature isnt there, like when a character cant talk with you. secondly, the wonder that encompasses gameplay the first time round just isnt there in later saves, and this can be a huge loss for such an awe-inspiring game. however, if youre willing to try out mods, theres no end to the content you can find. the final issue is how combat and even other skills can become incredibly unbalanced in the latter part of the game. my answer to this is, once again, mods. the community has done an excellent job of rebalancing the game. and any of these slight problems pales in comparison to the wonder and glee that will fill you when you kill your first troll, or join the companions, or successfully evade a way-too-powerful-for-you dragon. this is one of the greatest games i own, no doubt about it.",312.9
"when its on sale its very worth your money. the mods on this game are great. even though i get bored of the same game fast i find myself coming back to skyrim after i finish a game. been playing since early 2012 nvr got to finish the main quest. very often i find myself not using fast travel just because the game looks so good with graphical mods enabled. in my opinion it was well worth my time. will be continuing to play this game.",625.0
"for a very long time, this is the only game that ive played passed the 70 hour mark. great world and little snippets of story and lore every where. combat is nothing to write home about but the flexibility and mods allows freedom to enjoy what you want from the game.",95.6
"the latest installation in the elder scrolls has had me captivated for so many hours i dont even want to actually know, but buying it from the day of release on 11.11.11, to this day it still lies high on my list of games to play when im bored. escapism at its greatest, and when youre given so much freedom its so easy to get lost in, skyrim is no.1 for rpg games ive come across in terms of replayability, design and gameplay. people may mock it for its petty flaws here and there, but its list of flaws compared to its list of triumphs is dwarfed massively. with lore so deep, i dread to think i may know more about elder scrolls history than real life history, but this is just yet another aspect of not only the game, but the series which makes the world feel so real and alive. with un-beaten character customisation and development, this allows players to create any character they can possibly imagine and play to as style which they choose. to any rpg fans whom havent yet discovered the elder scrolls series or for those looking to get into the genre, i cannot recommend this game enough, if you fall in love with the series like all elder scrolls fans do, youll get your moneys worth without a doubt.",13.0
"its ing skyrim, a time machine that only moves forwrd!!!",142.1

"a very nice rpg. would recommend to anyone looking for a modern rpg! :d",50.6
"like a few other people, i honestly thought elder scrolls were crap. the things id seen didnt look good, so i formed an opinion prior to playing the game. thankfully, im happy to report that after buying oblivion, the game prior to skyrim, i was proved so incredibly wrong. the games have so much to offer that theyre damn near perfect. the odd thing i wish would be different, but those things are minor, that the pros vastly outweigh any con i could come up with, and with the modding community, any con i could come up with is being solved, bringing it closer to the absolute perfect game. while my playtime isnt high on steam, i do also own skyrim for the 360... and ive logged probably a good 500 hours or so there playing through everything. and even though ive played through everything, it just doesnt get old. you can play and reply this game countless times, lose hours, days, weeks and months exploring this beautiful world. and if you have the expansions, it gives you even more places to explore. i cannot rate this game highly enough, and i would recommend it to absolutely anyone who loves rpg games. if you dont want to read all that above... simply put, this is a must have title for any fan of rpg games.",214.1

"well we waited so long for this game, and if you do not look at the fact that is a sequal to oblivion then it is a good game, buggy as hell and not even close in terms of graphics and gameplay to what it could or should have been. but all in all a good game, however if you consider the fact this is the sequal to the most successful rpg game ever, then epic fail bethesda quite posible that this is the weakest offering they could have knocked together, but just look at other recent games from bethsda (hunted demons forge, rage, brink), maybe bethesda should fire the current team and try again. a classic example of the turgid backwash developers puke on us pc gamers while  all the little kids with consoles, who think these games are epic? oh low i long for the glory days , when all game dev was done for pc and the dumbed down the game for consoles, or just did not bother with them at all. ok rant over.......buy it or boycott it up to you..",168.4

"skyrim, the fifth game in the elder scrolls saga. technically like, the ninth. or something like that. but anyway. the fifth game in the elder scrolls saga. what can i say about this game that hasnt already been said by every other reviewer? lets try to be creative. skyrim isnt just a game. skyrim is an experience. this is the true spirit of free-roaming gameplay, not just some dingy sandbox with nothing to do. every cavern, every dungeon, every village you go to is its own adventure. to say you can just beat skyrim is to say that youre done with your adventuring. and while, no, its not as immersive an experience as mass effect. and no, it doesnt have the subtle hues of storytelling that dark souls does. but elder scrolls has heart. you can take your game and modify it, adding countless new realms of adventure to the already expansive journey. you can create your own story by playing in a new and fantastic way. and best of all. you can really call it your own adventure. no two people will experience skyrim the same way, and i relish in that fact. so of course i will recommend this game. this is a game series that i hope continues long into the future and into new generations.",102.4

"skyrim is a good game all around with the main quest and all the side quests. but if you want a better game with more armor and weapons and make skyrim seem like a survival game, mod it! frostfall, immersive armors and weapons, enhanced blood are just a few mods that make the game better!",26.2

"a lot of improvements are evident in skyrim from oblivion. levelling up seems to take longer in oblivion, but the perks system on skyrim is much more interesting, though not always logical in terms of how skills progress. your journal gets pretty full on skyrim in a short time, there are tons of side-quests, the prima guide book is twice as thick as the oblivion guide, and has smaller print.. fortunately the dungeons are better designed in skyrim, always a quick way out once you clear them, rather than having to walk back the way you came. combat system is much improved with better blocking, dual-weapons and smoother attacks making fighting less frustrating than in oblivion. magic also progresses nicely, as does the weapon and armour upgrade system. enchanting and alchemy are more manageable, also.",470.6

"this game is epic in scale and detail, containing, potentially, hundreds of hours of gameplay. a first-person (with 3rd-person option) rpg in a vast world inspired by nordic myth. simply epic, and with even more content using the workshop. instead of one storyline as in many of todays games, this has a huge number of factions you can join, each with about 10-20 hours of play, plus a pretty good main-quest (faction quests are better, imho), smaller local quests, and many locations to explore. everything is hand-crafted. you can play anything from a warrior to a thief to an assassin to a mage each with distinct gameplay. this is also a major improvement over oblivion in terms of gameplay - combat is much more fluid now. if you liked oblivion, do get this. if you get this, make sure you also buy the dragonborn dlc, which adds a very big landmass flavoured after morrowind with huge amounts of coolness.",207.9

"i gotta give this game a thumbs up. ive been a fan of the elder scrolls series since i first played morrowind. i was a little skeptical of this game at first since i got used to the way your skills and leveling up worked in morrowind and oblivion, but the leveling system in this game works well. also, you dont have to have a ridiculous pc to run it. im running the game on medium settings just fine with an amd athlon ii x2 255 processor 3.10ghz, 4gb ddr3 ram, galaxy geforce 9500gt, under windows 7 pro. even just running at medium settings, the environments and characters look great.",149.7

"i waited forever to get this game for some reason, and while i didnt think it would be my thing, i still gave it a try. loading up the hd pack and downloading the unofficial patches to fix a bunch of known issues, i started and ended up having a good time. the mod community provides enough material for you to restart the game a few times, with additional missions, lands, weapons, npcs, and the like. its a lot of fun, and if you havent tried it, you should pick it up and have fun.",155.7

"i was kinda late on the skyrim bandwagon, but i see now why it was such a popular game. this game has an extremely open world for exploration, such that the open world genre has been made an understatement. because of this, some may not like this game if that doesnt appeal to their tastes, but i was thoroughly impressed by the variety of content, and got personally immersed in playing it for hours on end without boredom.",150.9

"i was first introduced to the elder scrolls series with daggerfall. loved it then, thought it was one of the best things to grace a pc, and my mind was blown when morrowind was released. oblivion was just a plesant continuation of things, and finally, skyrim.. ah skyrim. only one word comes to my mind for skyrim: epic. everything about it just feels epic, i cant think of a better way to say it. fans of the elder scrolls will adore it, and anyone being introduced to the series this way... well... theyll like it i think. i think theyll like it alot. =)",383.9

"very good once you start it kinda sucks you in the same with its predecessors. when you begin the main quest line its quite easy to get distracted and run into a dragon or giant then you will most likely accidently discover a new location which means even more exploring. as usual the game was not without its fair share of problems and it is bethesda were talking about who love to realease a game full of bugs that does get patched later on. i would say however from somone who put in 500+hours into oblivion this new edition to the elder scrolls saga seems a little less clunky there are some things missing that i would have loved to have seen make a reappearance such as the spell creator which leads me onto the fact that the spells are seriously weak, although dual casting does make them stronger when you reach a certain level you can no longer totally rely on spells as in oblivion. buy it anyway since its still a great game",283.0

"this game is ing amazing. i give it 50 out of 10, because this game doesnt care about math, it only cares about being awesome, and limits arent awesome, but dragons are, and dragons dont give a  about math either. the only downside to this game is that its so awesome youll want to play it all the time and your other games will cry because they wont ever be ha fraction of the awesome of this game, and then you might feel bad for them, but then youll realize they should man up and try to be half the game skyrim is. go forth and weep that every game you play after this will be less sweet, less bright, and just plain less, because they wont compare. one time a dragon was flying around going all nyeah nyeah you cant hit me so i told the sky to open up and hit that smarmy  with bolts of vengeance and then he died because ing awesome, thats why.",283.6

"this is probably by far the best rpg you will ever play (until tes:vi is released). the graphics by default are gorgeous, although for those of you expecting far cry level ultra graphics you may be a bit disappointed; bethesda intended the graphics to be good, but also to be able to run on lower-end pcs. the main quest is immersive and tells a decent story, and there are also numerous side quests including thieves, mages and assassins - also not forgetting the civil war or the companions. the dawnguard and dragonborn dlcs also add in loads more hours of gameplay, also including a main quest for each and other numerous side quests. your character is who you want him/her to be: mage, knight, soldier, assassin, thief, etc... which is great for an rpg - i cant forget that you can also be an alchemist, a blacksmith an enchanter and/or a werewolf and/or vampire! the best part of this game for me though is the modding capability: there is literally a mod for everything! high resolution texture replacers for just about everything in-game, ranging from the landscape to tiny bits of clutter, extreme quality dlc type quest mods, amazing quality house mods, armour mods, weapon mods, etc... this game is a must for any pc gamer! 10/10",34.9
"what is there to say, its skyrim! this game is purely amazing in every aspect that it contains. many places to explore, a lot of quest, very many skills and very nice looking graphics. the elder scrolls games always one up each other and skyrim really one uped oblivion for sure. the story for this game is good, not real amazing, but it has interesting points to it. the core gameplay for skyrim is the free roaming around looking for things to explore and kill. this game has steam workshop which as loads of mods and other plugins to make it an even better game. plus you have the nexus website which has even more mods you can add to your game. this is a must buy for any one who wants a great rpg and wants it to last for hours upon hours. 10/10 hands down.",211.1
"after all these years skyrim is still amazing and even if you add mods or not the game is such a great experince and if you enjoy free roaming doing what you want wen you want, or maybe joing a guild of thiefs or wizards im sure this game will have something you want or love",149.9
"while the base game is good entertaining for about 40-50 hours, the mods and workshop will give you almost unlimited content. this extra content can alter the already existing gameplay or add even more. is it worth 15? yes. and if you get it during a sale be sure to pick up the legendary edition to get some sweet dlc",36.2

"really, this game is simply best described as a dumbed down version of morrowind with much better graphics or a greatly improved oblivion with a workable leveling system. do not expect an incredibly subtle story like tes iii; instead its save the world as youre destined to contrived situation. instead focus on the beauty and open worldness of the game, and the modibility which should allow for the game to essentially become whatever you want it to. not quite as fresh as say new vegas, but still pretty good.",179.6

"the games the keeps on giving. thanks to the huge modding community surrounding this game, its truely become one of the best games ever made. a must for any pc gamer. i highly reccomend using an xbox 360 wired controller (there is native support built in) and getting a nexus account to install mods. you can easily pour 200 - 500 hours into this game with all of the level add-ons and quests. get the legendary edition, even two years later, its still worth the $40 or so buck youll pay for it. its even better if you can pick it up on a discount weekend. for the best experience.. at least a 64bit version of windows and 6-8 gigs of ram and a very good video card.. this game is amazing in high graphical texture mod.",71.7
"fantastic game. theres so much stuff packed into it that youll still be stumbling into new stuff to do 200+ hours into your first playthrough. countless mods and community-made expansion packs make the game just that much better. theres even a massive unofficial patch for many of the more irritating bugs. skyrim is definitely one of those games that truly shines on the pc over any other platform because of its sheer versatility.",240.3

"the music is absolutely epic, one can walk days through skyrim and wont get bored. i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes rpg and wants explore everything for himself. since there is no character build, you can level anything you like whenever you like.",103.9
"i cant say enough about this game. between my wife and i, we have played over 300 hrs of this game. it will immerse you in a world full of adventure, fantasy and rich lore. there are a ton of mods for this game which allows you to customize the game how you want it if you are not happy with the vanilla version. you will definitley get your moneys worth out of this game with the length of the campaign along with side quests and replay value. if you are a fan of western rpgs or enjoyed any of the previous elder scrolls or fallout games, get this game now!",160.1
"first of all id like to say that i have over 200 hours of skyrim on ps3. anyway, this game is amazing. everything about it is just... wow! pros: epic scenery, open world exploration, loot!, dragons, arrows to the knees, soundtrack :d cons: fighting could be a little more on target and less like an irishmen leaving a bar at 5 in the morning, being over encumbered and spiders (those were just personal haha.)",37.8

"great game with epic moments and tons of weird things and bugs, but who cares. youneed this. 95/100",113.2
"i play this the most on my libary right now, but it has many flaws, especally the flat end, if you beat all the main quests the lust for playing it sevearly dies, the pc version has mods so it keeps refreshing itself, just a bit, but multiplayer as a addon instead of them makeing elder scrolls online, i would have been happyer, especally if it expanded the world, and i wouldent have minded if it would have taken longer, and costed 30 $ or less to get.",326.4
"10/10 - skyrim has its flaws and is probably worse than previous tes games, but it is still the game, because you will not find any other. large and authentic world full of places to explore, bandits to kill, hills to climb on horseback and quests to get and fulfill.",308.2
"this is an awesome game with plenty of places to visit and dugeons to explore,huge selections of mods,moonpath to elsweyr i especially recommend and enough to choke a dragom.10/10 must purchase.",67.1
"an awesome rpg with an epic world and decent combat.",7.7
"with the mods and all the dlc .. this game never seems to end ..",90.3
"this game is the closest thing to living out my fantasy of being conan the destroyer. combat is highly satisfying. dungeons and enemies get repetitive but not unbearable. the world of skyrim is beautiful, the npcs are believable. your first time with a dragon is as intense as it should be.",29.6
"i love this game. i can play it again and again and again and again and again and still find new stuff to do. my only problem with it off course is that it tends to glitch. a lot. but if you can manage to ignore it then seriously this game is worth getting.",271.0
"skyrimn is a great game and a big time suck. while i like many had a hard time actually beating the game because of the amount of time i spent doing other things. if you are looking for a world class rpg then this is it!",63.7
"i love this game. it keeps me entertained for hours at a time. it is even better because of the steam workshop allowing you to continually add and upgrade new content. i love that you can choose your own destiny and be what ever you want. i also like the whole marriage concept. usually in a game i am afraid to do any of the marriage quests because it is a real person and you never know who you are dealing with. but this has actual characters that you can marry which makes it safe. the only thing i have found that i wish was better is the character choices. the hairstyles and war paint markings are almost the same for all the races and the colors could be more varied too. other than that this game is the best one i have played so far with or without all the add-ons.",583.4
"this game doesnt support native keyboard mapping of the key numpad keys (or any key that i want)? i remember remapping keys for 16-bit dos games on my 486 dx pc. thumbs down to your crappy pc game that now requires me to use a partially supported xbox controller. eat dragon dung. the game defaulted to ultrahigh graphic settings and runs at my 5760 x 1080 desktop resolution. looks good until the menus show up all out of whack. sad that the game is dragged down due to keyboard mappings and non-native support for widescreen gamers.",11.6
"this game does not have a short main quest, and you could zoom in with the bow in oblivion",227.9
"absolutely one of the best rpgs ive played. skyrim was one of the first rpgs that i really got into and i enjoyed every bit of it. although the graphics are a tad aged at the time of writing this review (3 years post release), it is still a beautiful game. bethesda never lets us down. 10/10 would buy again.",81.9
"this game is truly amazing in so many ways writing them here would be breaking some kind of steam law. i will say this though, its more than lived up to being an rpg and redefined how i want to enjoy these types of games in the future. story is amazing, game is beautiful and gameplay is very simple. overall 10/10!",222.3
"no words can even describe the majesty this game holds...",348.1
"he is dragonborn! *falls of cliff and kills himself* yep that was how my first non story dragon fight went. anyway down to why i have decided to write this review. so skyrim is one of my new favorite games, i love it. i mean charging at a dragon to get that cinamatic kill and thoes times where you miss click and your character decides. *hmmm im fighting a dragon right now and i need to heal so let me just holster my weapon so i can get burned horrificly. so my verdict on skyrim is 9/10 not a 10 because i have moments where the game just says f**k you matt you aint going to take one more step or i will bluescreen you! overall a enjoyable experiance. dragon fus ro dah!!!!! *matt flys off into orbit*",93.8
"the best single player rpg ive ever played hands down. you can do pretty much anything in the world of skyrim. very realistic. the story is grand and the fighting and battles are epic. from crafting your own armor to reading the books, every angle has been thought out and no stone unturned to give you the best sandbox experience you could ever have in a single player role playing game. 10 out of 10 for this title. stellar gaming experience.",196.5

"steam workshop makes it a millon times better, console commands make it possible to work around game breaking bugs, and its just better overall",78.4
"pretty great, but i had to mod the crap out of it to completely enjoy it. there are lots of 3rd party fixes to most of the bugs, as well as an alternate start mod so you dont have to sit through the tedious opening or the point where you finish going through a cave just to get told to go fetch a rock in another cave. that is what the game consists of without mods. bugs, caves, snow, caves, long waits, caves, rocks, caves, mountains, caves, dragons, and caves. with the steam workshop, you can solve that problem with the very mods that make this game worth it.",144.3
"i mean seriously.....do you not own this game yet? really? for real? i mean.....come on. youre kidding. best game of the year. you dont have it? were you dropped as a child? often? by both parents? buy it already! game of the year!",204.1
"i usually hate games with spells and swords with elves running around the place. which made me avoid this game when it was released, all the more difficult to admit it may be one of the most enjoyable games i have ever played. expansive and involving with enough of a talented modding community around it to make even more beautiful to behold 10/10.",239.6

"one of the best time sinks money can buy. with all the workshop content the game never ends, 150hrs on console and bought it again for pc.",67.0
"this game can be very..very..very..long if your ocd for sidequests like i am..(i dont even know if i have the main story in my quests) and worried about walking into the infinate looping sidequests. the game has a few bugs in but its nothing game breaking, its enjoyable to rpg fans and obviously to elder scrolls fans. the 1st dragon kill can be very satisifiying but after like 10 of them it just feels like a normal enemy since the random spawn is so common.",272.0
"sweet  of baby jesus, game of the year every year.",897.6
"doesnt live up to the older titles. ok action game pretty bad in the rpg department.",145.5

"absolutely excellent adventure game. not as much of an rpg as its predecessors, but still stays true to the elder scrolls lore and feel. the biggest drawback is the go here, kill that, pick that up, and bring it back feel to the hyped up radiant system. bethesda are forver making leaps and bounds in the audio/visual departments of their games but the writing could have been stronger, specially for the dark brotherhood side story and the companions quest line. several dungeons feel copy-pasted in their environments but what stray from the beaten path turn out to be absolutely stunning. bethesda have tried their best to remove back tracking from dungeons by adding frequently used shortcuts from the end rooms, which are useful when you reach the dungeon chest and are close to carrying capacity and need to sell what loot youve already hoarded. mods add a ridiculous amount of replayability to this game, just like they do for all other bethesda open world games, and with a very active community still modding over two years past release date youll never run short of silly, fun and even professional looking user-made content to renew your interest in this game.",298.7

"if you want to say: hey, i just finished skyrim then dont play this game. you dont finish skyrim because it is a world, not a game. almost all of the secondary quests are amazing, some of them are also as good as the main quest. you can have a lot of different playstiles like half mage half warrior, marksman assassin... also, the number of mods that there is in nexus adds a lot more variety to the world. i just love this game, sometimes i enter skyrim just to go to falkreath mounted on arvak and sleep at the dead mans drink at night and then i just go kill some dragons and clear a big dungeon. i love this game, 100% recommended ah...the life of a hero.",391.7

"one of the most amazing games of all time, no game will give you the same kind of game-time that this game can. visually impressive, well written, exiting and calming. at times youll be doing anything from raiding a camp to fighting a dragon! and then at other times youll be happy to just stroll along the fast open world that is skyrim.",58.3
"the story has no soul. the trailer is more exciting than the whole game... ui is utterly terrible (please create a graphical interface... this isnt a spreadsheet... just copy the witcher!) the mouse is sluggish and no change in the .ini files will change it for me... mods improve the game, but not to the degree that makes me want to play...",22.6
"i huge step up from morrowind and id go as far to say the mods are even better! as usual there will always be something to do, you can take any path you want do whatever you however you want! the diversity to the story and the world of skyrim itself is jaw droppingly amazing. if you own a pc and you dont have skyrim youre missing out on months of hibernation playing this. i own this on my ps3 as well so that im not tempted to cheat either haha!",132.8

"my favorite game ever made. ive owned it on ps3, xbox, and now pc. the game lets you do whatever you want, and gives you the most lovingly crafted, beautifully designed game world ive ever seen to do it in. one of the only games that you can truly keep coming back to. you can look at any door, open it, and explore whats behind it. you can see an impossibly far away mountain peak, and you can scale it. you can make potions, weapons, armor. you can be a thief or a knight or an alchemist (all with the same character if you want). there are just so many things to see and do that i wont ever be really sure ive seen or done them all. that alone makes it worth the purchase tenfold for me. people will complain about the combat system being shallow (and i mostly agree), and there are some definite bugs, but i will gladly accept those things in exhange for the world of skyrim. the soundtrack is beautiful, the modding community is absolutely insane, and the team at bethesda are so obviously passionate about the world of the elder scrolls. there are so many games that i love, but i have never been truly immersed like i am while playing skyrim. if you cant tell, i heartily recommend this amazing game.",56.3
"in the land of skyyriimmmmm such a catchy song uugh owh hey didnt see ya there oh you came to hear my review of skyrim in that case hold your horses skyrim is a good rpg its amazing with some good mods and the graphics dlc skyrim looks absolutely fabulous if youre wondering why i havent played much its because i played a ton on xbox 360 and when i finally upgraded my pc i bought it on pc version to enjoy the graphics and play whit mods i strongly recommend this game, 10/10 imperials would try to kill me again",57.7
"i took a break from gaming for the last decade. my last console was a gamecube. i bought skyrim on the recommendation of a friend (who hasnt left gaming for a decade), and holy freaking cow. its slightly better than a gamecube game. after 120 hours, to say my mind is officially blown is the understatement of the decade.",138.3

"must have for immersion and graphics enthusiasts. great modding experience. the most beautiful world i have ever seen in a game, i must say. the open world aspect is full of surprises and without any repetition, even all the side quests that require you to fight your way through an abandoned dungeon have great variety due to the greatly differing environments built by the many races in tes. great dlc with a nice price. for greatest fun and immersion check out the skyrim modding nexus even before you first play the game. i recommend grabbing the legendary edition in some sale.",163.0
"this was the first elder scrolls game i played. i really like it, but i feel they concentrated heavily on the scenery/graphics rather than everything else. i had to do a lot of pretending while playing, and a lot of modding when i bought it for pc to make it generally immersive. i wish there was a kind of but not really option in the middle of the yes/no recommendation. its one of those games where ill play it for a really long time and be incredibly into it, but then i end up being completely untinterested suddenly and will have to stop playing for several months before i become re-interested in it.",160.6

"a great addition to the elder scrolls series. the game itself is great but the modding community makes it amazing! it has so much content that i have yet to finish the game. i keep getting distracted with all of the side quests and mods. it is a game that you can play straight through and miss a ton of content. on the flip side you can work on side quests and mods and just never get around to finishing the game. it has it quarks like all the elder scrolls games but usually they are funny and just add to the charm of the game.",743.0

"its pretty much the most gorgeous game ive played to date. skyrim has raised the bar for every other game ill be playing. the game environment sucked me in, the gameplay pulled me under, and the story left me wanting more. it also makes me want to go back and play oblivion just to see the previous elder scrolls installment, since i never had the opportunity to play that one the whole way through.",146.3

"the fifth game of the elderscrolls series i found this game pretty fun. lots of sidequest loaads and loads of places to explore all those books to read all that lore. best of all mods lots and lots of mods to spice up the game my only complaint of this game that with out moding controlls, ui and optimization mods the game runs so choppy even on a decent computer the mouse acceleration and worst of all fov ( thankfully you could use the console for that, unfortunately you cannot have your acheivements unlock ), if you have a full inventory or hoarded all those potions and scrolls? having that will make your inventory management a total chore despite all that the games pretty solid and i would recomend this if you like slaying those dragons",170.1

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"its ok at first but its combat mechanics and storyline have no real depth to them. i found the story boring and played out and the combat leaves a  to be desired. if you like rpgs and have experience in the genre youll end up feeling unsatisfied, because there isnt really any balance in the late-game, modded or not, and the combat is absolutely horrendous. that being said, i was able to spend 300 hours in it regardless of its flaws. thats because this game has an extremely high production value and looks absolutely stellar.",329.3

"skyrim will never get boring. even after finishing the main storyline, there is so much rich content included in the game. highly recommend for replayability. oh, the graphics are amazing. truly an immersive game. 10/10 will play again.",208.8
"a fantastic game. the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is nearly endless. you can spends hours running around completing quests or riding your horse trying to hunt down dragons. if you want to experience this game in its full glory you may need a beefier cpu an gpu, but you will still enjoy it with lesser components. this game allows you to create your own play style whether you sneek in and stab people from behind or run in with a elven broadsword hacking your foes to pieces you can play an unlimited amount of ways. it is well worth the price.",85.7
"a great rpg experience. improves heavily on the mechanics of oblivion. skyrim provides hundreds of hours of gameplay and builds apon its predeceer (tes:oblivion) graphical fidelity is sadly not the greatest in skyrim but mods and enbs are available to add to the experience. but the game makes up for this with lush landscapes and mightly mountians to explore. the environments range from snowy mountians to the sunny town of riverrun to the towering capital solitudes blue palace. outdoors environments help build the epic atmosphere of skyrim with wildlife and bandits. but best of all. dragons. fighting dragons is the pinnacle experience of the game as they approach from the sky you will have to use shouts. as the dragonborn, you can use these shouts to cast a dragon from the sky to the ground, breath fire and even freeze time. as the dragonborn your primary quest will be to save the world from the almighty dragon alduin. but not just that, you can pursuit many more quests, you can just the dark brotherhood, become a mage, join the companions and even become a bard! skyrim is a world so engrossing that its flaws are more than made up for with its impressive open world, immersive character development and amount of incredible content. i recommend this game to everyone, skyrim truly is an epic experience!",278.1
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played. its also in the steam top 10 most played games ! if you dont own a skyrim, get it now ! you wont regret your money. the game itself is an adventure, the main story line is so long + a lot of amazing side quests and dlcs. once you will finish the game you can download tons of mods for more quests/monsters/armors/weapons... 10/10",130.2
"skyrim. the fifth installment in the elder scrolls series and arguably, the best of them. this game has an astounding amount of content. there are hundreds of hours of gameplay excluding dlcs . the difficulty is perfect. with up to seven difficulty options it will match your level of play, new to the game or experienced as hell. arguably better than the elder scrolls iii, morrowind, said to be the best rpg of all time. skyrim is a game that no-one will ever play the same way you do, where everything you say and do impacts the story wheter the slightest bit, or in the most epic and emotional events. having few around the world ever 100% completing this, your guarenteed the largest, and addicting game youll ever play. and like me, you will never regret this purchase. ever.",221.5
"wow, cant begin to descibe how good this game is.... when i first heard about people talking about this game i automatically assumed they were nerds, but playing this doesnt make you feel like you are playing dungeons and dragons, or wow. it feels like you are another person, choosing your own path; slaughtering innocent townspeople, becoming a hero who wants to protect all that is right, or even becoming a master vampire and living out in the marsh with a house you built (dlc required). the landscapes are stunning, the ai is, i cant say the best, but compared to games like just cause 2 and and arma 2, they are much better. i spent 250 hours playing vanilla, and still have not completed the dawnguard questline as a dawnguard member, or finished the companion questline (i hate the companions if you buy the game hopefully you will agree with me), and still am doing quests. need cash and love killing? join the dark brotherhood, a ancient organization which carries out assinations. want to be a master wizard (you get to zap people with lightning and )? join the mage college of winterhold. after 250 hours i got mods which made the game so much better. buy it. stop wasting your time trying to find out if its good, because it is.",362.9

"amaazing game!! had it on my 360 when it originally released and built a new pc yesterday and when i saw the steam sale price i couldnt resist. one of the best rpgs to exist",2.7
"i feel conflicted about this game. it is fun for a good 50-70 hours, but after that time you start to realise how much of the game is copypasted or just bland dull. once you get over that big hump of gameplay and start to see the game is wide as an ocean, but deep as a puddle with nothing you do effecting really...anything. if you want to play a elder scrolls game, play morrowind. if graphics are an issue for you, play with mge. so its a fun game for ~50 hours, but after that, it isnt. so... ill reccommend the game, but advise that you play morrowind after.",120.1
"by it self, skyrim is an ok game. it has some sold rpg with some semi intresting storyline. in my opinion most of the elder scrolls stories, for the most part i found rather dull or just meh. where this game really shines is the player made mods and addons or the steam workshop. with this many players have taken time out of theyre own lives to fix / improve this game and many others for free. many of the mods/addons in the steam work shop are hands down better then anything bethesda every did in theyre dlc. not only is it better but often enough players will even fix the bugs that bethesda made themselves. now that to me means, there really are good gammers/modders out there that are willing to step up and make games better.",174.3
"its skyrim. you probably already know everything you need to know.",46.7
"i dont need to say anything about skyrim or other elder scrolls games. they are not compared to other games. other games are compared to elder scrolls. skyrim doesnt deny its origins and is a faithfull part of tamriels conturbated story. skyrim is epic. that would be enough to say but lets say something else as well. it b brings life to the northern side of tamriel as never done before and puts you into the role of the dovahkiin, the dragonborn, a hero, as those sung by bards, born with blood of the dovah, the dragons, and sets you in an adventure that you wont see anywhere else. you will brave the lush fields, snowy pastures, crowded cities and ancient tombs and dungeons of skyrim, where a battle for control is in place while dragons from the past are coming back to life. you will battle thru the guts of dragons and draugr, vampires and werewolves, and help comrades, thieves, assassins, companions and so much more that cant be said and done in these few lines. you are dragonborn and all the secrets of the world await for you!",151.1
"skyrim... an awesome game with many choices...no need to redo your character if you are fed up with beeing an archer...just start swinging a twohander and soon you will be as good. great stuff!",134.4
"skyrim is another world better then this one in so many ways, you really do live another life. i always thught skyrim was just another bad aaa game then one day i saw the witcher 2 on sale so i added founds to my steam for the first time and i got it, then i saw g-mod witcher 1 and darksouls 1 and got then too but then i saw skyrim i didnt expect to like it but i got it... i fell in love. i have played over 850 hours of skyrim i have gotten all 75 achievements the level 5 badge all the emoticons and backgrounds, skyrim is one of my top 3 games of all time. if you see this game on sale buy it. i will never forget! i am harbinger!, i am nightingale!, i am arch-mage!, i am dawnguard!, i am legate!, i am dragonborn!.",952.9

"this is one of my top games i ever playd and bought nice graphics,best open world, i got the hearthfire also you can adopt childers how much roleplay like a real life game in those ages, there are alot of things i can say alot of positive and good things im bored to write them. my rate is 11/10",149.1
"its like fallout but with magic, more epic environments and landscapes, improved graphics, amazing soundtracks, huge world to explore, etc. fallout is epic as well, but this game goes beyond that. everything that is good, this game has it!! except for the freaking spiders which has become a nightmare for me. yes, im arachnophobic. i know that there are mods to replace it but im a bit lazy at the moment. :| my rating: 10/10",130.9
"most of the achievements are attainable through normal play; theres only a few you might not discover on your own through thorough world exploration. combat is gimmicky and takes some time to get used you; you can sidestep that by going destruction to help get you embedded in the game before tackling a major learning curve. crafting mechanics are super-dull; these can be updated with mods if youre inclined. the game took me about 130 hours to finish all-in including most (but not all) of the side content; about 2/3s of the way through, i was totally, thoroughly bored of destruction and started to switch things around--the difficulty level is basically static over the course of the game, so its easy enough to switch play-types mid-game or even late in the game. the game has several bugs, some subtle and some quest-breaking. these can be gotten around through console commands you can find through google searches, sometimes by resetting quests, sometimes by turning collision momentarily off. requires some patience and tenacity since they really only come up in sensitive moments. still, skyrim is immersive, open, and beautiful. recommended.",154.7
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"draugr dungeon simulator 2011 - if you want a good game that doesnt just throw you into dungeons and that actually has difficulty, play dark souls 2.. if you want better quests then play oblivion or morrowind... this is a sad excuse for an elder scrolls game and basically threw the good things that iii and iv did out the fufkin window. if you still want to get this game, get some mods for it, its the only way it doesnt become a repetitive peice of garbage. by about 1hr into the game you will be thinking oh great another dragon to kill, this is so thrilling or oh, so i have to go to this draugr dungeon to finish the quest... its so pointless without mods that fix it",79.3

"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",71.8

"i did not enjoy vanilla skyrim and i honestly preferred oblivion (in content and story). the progression in skyrim is a tad lacking but the main issue with the game is a lack of an escalating story. you hear about the war and how dragons are causing problems for everyone, how much of a threat they are... and yet you dont see a war, and you certainly dont see dragons posing a threat. however, the world is large and beautiful with plenty of content to entertain for hours. the modding community has greatly improved the content and quality of skyrim, turning it into something palatable... although, the story still remains as dull as ever. the beauty of skyrim is enhanced further by the modding community, turning it into something truly impressive.",112.5

"even at 354 hours ( at the time or writing ), i can safely say i have not completed the game. there is just so much content with the game that you can multiple playthroughs and never end up the same way. after you beat the main quest there is still so much to do that it doesnt feel like the game ended. it takes after oblivion in the sense that you can dedicate a lot of time into one guild, whether it be thieves, dark brotherhood, or the champions, or just focus on the main quest and have a race with a friend to see who can finish first. i personally would recommend this to anyone with a powerful enough computer, one that is about three years old should be able to handle it. the quests can pile up and seem overwhelming with the amount to do at times, but other than that pesky nuisance it is almost perfect to anyone looking for an open world adventure of a lifetime",388.2

"a rather medioker game all in all, with sufficent amounts of lore and less than engaging moral choices. it is also very easily broken, to the point where i have killed dragons with nothing with my bare fists, or even killed them in one strike of my dagger. that said the modding community is what really makes this game come to life, adding more personality into every aspect you might wish from the game.",154.0
"9.4/10 skyrim, this, i can truthfully say, is onle of the best games i have ever played. the immersive feel of whenever youre trying to bow down enemies of your guild with a bow, the role playing of drinking beer i n a bar, the fear that you feel when you see a troll. all of these factors make skyrim my favorite rpg. the sheer quantity of things you can do, the ways you can play, you way you can look! when you play skyrim, you feel like youre really choosing your own path, more than just an alternate ending, or a certian team. you choose what you do; and how you do it. ive never played a game like it, you really get to know it well, get in to routines, without it ever seeming repetitive, you just enjoy knowing where to run, or how to hide. even when you do get to know skyrim, complete the quests, max out your skills. you introduce yourself to the vast modding comunity, both on the nexus and on the workshop, you can get so many different types of mods, being able to see that dragons wing in more quality, or adding a whole new hold on a far away island, you never run out of mods to explore. these things are what add to why skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time, a must buy for and roleplayer, explorer or combat-lover",79.3
"this is probably one of the most enjoyable games ive ever played. its a new game with a distinctly oldschool style to it, and it works very well. everything from the game mechanics, to the ingame console remind me of some of my favorite fps games from the past two decades. not a perfect game by any means; the issues youll sometimes run into prevent it from being a smooth and polished experience. however, the sheer amount of content and replayability packed into it make this game a worthy purchace if you dont already have it (its 2015, you most likely either love it or hate it).",523.1

"no faults with it at all..maybe once in awhile youll run into a couple of bugs and glitches which are usually pretty funny and random when they happen but nothing really game breaking plus it gives you the choice to use your 360 controller in case you dont feel like using your keyboard,so basiclly if you love wide open world games and rpgs than this game is for you:d and dont forget the modding part;) skyrim is brilliant simple as that and with mods it makes this epic game even more brilliant:)",86.9

"well, its the worst tes game out of the last three. its the worst ported out of all of them. and it has the worst dlc/expansions and by far the worst community (modders/wiki/etc) of all of the games. but if you can look past that, and can look past the horrible combat, you can find a pretty decent casual open world rpg. if you have an incredibly short attention span and arent able to deal with having to actually properly build a character like in other rpgs, skyrim is perfect. if youre looking for something with more depth, pick up morrowind or even oblivion, if you want fun combat, dark souls is the way to go. if youre a big fan of sports games and battlefield/cod/whateveraaa trash then skyrim should be a great deal of fun for you. the only content worthwhile here is the modded content, so buying this game basically means your money went to the wrong people. please dont support bethesda, if you have to have this game at least buy it on sale for cheap.",354.4

"if you value your social life, this isnt the game for you. bethesda comes back with another title that makes you lose the motivation to do anything but complete every  quest in this game. skyrim is masterpiece of an rpg that sets the bar higher than it ever was before, with gameplay and the rpg aspect of skyrim being its main attractor youll be pleasantly surprised to find some really enjoyable questlines in your playthrough and if you enjoy elderscrolls games all i have to say is make sure you keep yourself healthy cause im not kidding when i say that days, as in 24 hour days can go by in a flash when you get in the zone. oh my and the dlcs just add another 150 hours to the 300+ hour experience skyrim has to offer. modding will be the end of you, firstly remember to backup but after that mods will keep you entertained for as long as you wish. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is literally the most hours for dollar you will ever get from a game - the community is and has been active since its release just churning out quality mods for the game, as well as that the vanilla game has already too much to do for a single lifetime and i guarantee after that estimated 300 hours of gameplay youll stll be finding new things to do.",425.6

"honestly, before i bought this game, i just went around saying it was a piece of junk. i then bought it a couple months ago, back in 13. love it. its a great game, perfect for a medieval setting like mount and blade: warband, except it has more fantasy in it, such as magic and the dragons. either way, i would recommend this. especially when its on sale.",15.0
"although i am not much of a pc gamer, playing skyrim was one of the best decissions of my gaming career. a massive open world, so many choices, and some decent acting, as well as countless adventures that you can send your dragonborn on; what more could you ask for, dlc? well, skyrims got dlcs in spades. theres hearthfire, which allows for the adoption of children and the construction of 3 actual mansions that dot skyrims landscape. then theres dawnguard, which brings in a force of legendary vampire hunters and a group of true vampires. and finally, theres dragonborn, which takes across the seas, of the coast of morrowind, to the mysterious island of solstheim, which in itself, is a huge enigma. face countless enemies, find legendary treasures, and save tamriel from a rising terror, formed from legends and stories of heroes and brave warriors. are you of dragon blood, or are you a snibbling, whining milk drinker?! i give this game a 9.8/10, for shear creativity, decent acting, and such a broad world that you can explore. :d",230.2

"whilst my lap top cant run it perfectly, or smoothly at all. i had great fun playing it and using the cheats. it may start out like the modern jrpgs that force linear gameplay. after that you can just begin at adventuring.you can rather walk across miles of ground (and oversized mountains that always block your path) or even just fast travel for 50 gold pieces, this has a huge problem when it promotes exploring, the phrase time is money applays. the biggest problem in my opinion has to be that some areas have level 14 enimies that block me off from any future quest area. games like south park the stick of truth make it so that all mobs have stats that changes to my level, this make gameplay easy. but tose are the only two problems that deserve to be noted. of course i could complain about the voice acting or viking helms (which dont have horns) but that is nothing but nitpick; this game is a: 9.4/10",3.2

"overall: great fun. if you like exploring, roaming and looting, this is definately the game for you. skyrim is a huge place, where youll find mostly scandinavian-like countryside, but still a huge variety of ambience and style. i did not really play this for the story, it is kinda interesting, but not too deep and pretty short. the main part of the game (at least for me) is roaming, sidequests and exploring. there are quite some generic misc-quests which will send you into a dungeon you then finish and return the quest. this might get boring after a while. however it is very exciting for a lot of dungeons. the dwemer ruins especially are awesome. but still, if you find yourself stuck with boring quests, there is the steam-workshop loaded with free mods and/or custom made questlines. potential for hundreds of hours of gameplay!",107.9

"this game has a great storyline its way better than oblivion or morrowind please try it out its so fun.",163.0
"well, i played this game about 28 hours, so i think i know enough about this game and its dlcs, so i can write a review. i have played the both games before skyrim, morrowind and oblivion. in my opinion both were awesome games with graphics better than everything bevore them. that is the same in skyrim. also the main story is very good, although its just about 20 hours if you use cheats and dont enjoy it. but you should enjoy it. the main story is full with little details with make the game unforgetable. but the best on every the elder scrolls game is the sidestory. you can be everyone you want to be, you can marry, you can get chhilds and so on. so you should buy it, the price isnt high and you can spend more than 500 hours without getting it boring. trust me",27.6
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",248.6

"i went into this game with high hopes, ive heard good things, ive heard bad things, but i finally decided to get my own opinion about it. after about 35h playtime ive come to a conclusion. this game isnt that great. before you  yourself let me explain, ive explored almost the entire continent, gone into every cave, ruin, and mine i came across, even attempted some of the quests, but basically the only thing this game has going for it is the decent looking environment, thats it. exploration was fun for that 35 hours, but then i realized something, this game has some boring  quests. nothing at all in comparison to morrowind, and especially nothing in comparison to oblivion, which had some pretty incredible quests, this installment was just a disappointment. i wanted to like it, but you cant really force yourself to like something that is just 85% poorly designed. i recommend any aspirant buyers to wait until it is very low in price, or pirate it, i dont give a , just dont pay full price for this mediocre bethesda title.",38.4
"the first time i played skyrim it was around december of 11. a family member had brought it over and i thought these graphics are amazing, i dont deserve to have access to this. with the right mods to flesh out the game, skyrim can be right up there with morrowind. if your pc can handle it, i say give it a shot.",34.0

"in the early days of cinema there where a variety of movies that capitalized on low cost special effects, skyrim borrows a lot from these types of films. by shouting at enemies, and even goats, you make them stumble backwards as if by magic. this isnt revealed to you until youre half way through the game and told by mysterious shouting from atop a mountain that you must trek up the mountain and meet these shouters. youre then tasked with saving the world, again, and the most critical choice of the entire game comes after youve actually completed the game. time travel is involved, and theres plenty of goofy throwbacks to horrible movies in the form of a vampire den full of well-to-do vampire lords who thrive for thousands of years doing things that should have gotten them taken out a millenia ago. to join the thieves guild you simply walk into town with any loot in your inventory. keeping with tradition, bethesda has one animator and combat involves clicking until things die and nothing more. features such as crafting spells where replaced to make room for dlc for your xbox.",191.0

"hardly a leap forward for rpgs, more like a few poorly animated strafe-steps to the side. even so, skyrim boasts a vast world, beautiful too when modded correctly. the charcter building and progression is really enjoyable and addictive until multiple high level powers are attained, then the distinctiveness of a character is ruined a little. the voice acting is horrific. dat shout tho. epic, detailed, bugged and enjoyable.",56.6
"yes,yes,yes,yessss!!!!!!!!! this is my favorite game of all time! you are living in the medieval ages who finds out that hes a dragonborn! the posibilities are endless on this game! you can be a knight,thief,mage,a berserker, and a lot more! it is very well done with the best graphics ive seen in my entire life!!!! and yes, i said mage, you have a chance to be the most bada#s spell master in the land of skyrim! the regular skyrim is fantastic, yet if you want to have the experience of a life time, save up your money for the legendary adition! i would rate this game 100,000,000,000,000,000,/ 10!!! thanks, and i hope this review was helpful!=) p.s.- be a dark elf, its the best race ever!!!!!",32.7

"once upon a time i had friends, a life, a chance at a career. and then 2011 happened and skyrim was released. it infected my 360 and siezed ahold of me even stronger than its predessesors, confining me to a single chair for weeks on end against my will, not eating, not sleeping, not even noticing if someone was standing between me and the tv screen because i was so in tune with my character. the 360 had to be removed from my sight, and i avoided pictures of dragons in case they caused me to relapse. and then skyrim infected my computer, and now there is no hope for me. you can save yourself... but why fight something so wonderful?",219.1

"buy it, play it, mod the hell out of it. for the patient and technical ones, a delicious experience with a lot of variation, for those who just want to play, still a really good game. if youre looking for an adventure and spending time exploring, as usual, the elder scrolls has just what you need. although lacking the amazing atmosphere of its most highly regarded predecessor morrowind, the dazzling sights of skyrims mountainous northern landcape easily makes up for it. admittedly, skyrim does not exactly feel like a different world, like morrowind did, but rather more like an alternate past, which is a slight pity. playtime is, well, as long as you make it. again. mods. playstyle, i personally basically only play as a cloak and dagger character, as i find stealthing and sneak-attacking practically everyone oh so satisfying. just remember to quicksave before you try anything too dangerous. admittedly i could never get into any other playstyles, but seemingly there are those who enjoy other types as well. graphics, enb, find one you like, install, if your computer can handle it. audio, one of the weaker points i would say, but it does what it should, not too fond of the music or the sounds in general. in short, mod it. the game is far from perfect, but its bethesda, they only make flawed gems. i pun so hard.",339.1

"one of the best games ive ever graced my face with. i just got it on my computer and have already pumped in 16 glorious hours. on my xbox ive probably put at least 150 hours in, its extremely addicting and fun. just whatever you do, dont become a vampire, all the side effects are a .",10.5

"well, i dont have to tell a lot about skyrim. the quests and stories are good, the scenery is beautiful, i like the combat system. and with hdmods (or just the hi-res dlc) the game looks stunning as well. it is one of my favourite games at the moment. there are only a few things that can be improved, but most of them can be fixed by mods. my rating for the game: 8/10",72.1
"game is freaking great, the graphics are very well done, the gameplay and content is beyond belief, and to add on to it, dawnguard and dragonborn expansions are unbelieveable, the story line is just great. well done bethesda, and i tip my hat to all the mod creators on the workshop for this great fantasty medival game. but i give extra 10/10 to valve for creating steam and the community it has. bethesda and valve: beyond 10/10, cant thank you enough for the games you guys create and the experiences we have with them. a steam user- murtagh",38.5

"i am finding it hard to put into words just how impressive the elder scrolls v: skyrim is. i will try to be succinct. the game world and rendering engine is absolutely beautiful. the most common screenshot i take is simply of the awe-inspiring vistas found throughout the world. the world is also incredibly atmospheric - while wandering the frozen wastes around winterhold, ive never felt so alone in a computer game. combat and magick are similar to what weve seen in past tes games, but skyrim comes with a few new pros. there are a few cut-scene-style execution kills; instead of a straight 1-100 scale, you can now take perks which improve your abilities in various ways. this is a good addition, but some of the perks need to be re-scaled. skyrim has expanded what it means to be a role-playing game in the modern era. the world is livelier than ever, and you can do things like sit in an inn and listen to a bard sing; get married (not just a 10-second erotic cutscene!);",600.3

"hands down the biggest, baddest dungeon crawlinest elder scrolls game to date. between modding and the steam workshop, the game has been expanded to include a rediculous amount of updrades to the lighting, textures, ai, npcs, models, weapons, ui, and some even add entirely new locations and quests for hours of extra gameplay. a must have for anyone who enjoys rpgs.",156.2
"how could i not recommend this game. with the proper mods and patches, the game becomes much more alive. some of the magic of morrowind and oblivion seems to be missing from skyrim, but overall this game is awesome. it is unlikely you would regret your purchase.",104.5

"one of the only games that got me so hooked, i barely noticed the days of the week go by. incredibly open world,versatile and great controls. an incredibly fun game made even more fun by the use of mods. a game where you will always find soemthing new, even after many years. 9.9/10",83.5

"95 hours played, and still more places to visit, more quests to do and new things to discover, this before the modders have even had their way with it. unlike oblivion, skyrim had character, dungeons no longer have the identikit feel, and while it still feels as though every citizen of skyrim has the exact same things to say, at least they are no longer saying it in the exact same voice. yes, it has a poor interface, linear quests and linear dungeons, but it is a huge, absorbing, albeit flawed gem of a game.",122.3
"a game that no one should hate, best game ever to be playing even when there mods. anyone who hate this game are just a hater and a no one so pay no attention to them. this game can cause anyone to be playing for more than 400+hr and it wont stop there.",70.2
"this game... is fun. ive played better, and so have you. about the only thing that stands out for me in this title would be the intuitive crafting system, where its actually worth your time to spend time on it. however, that being said, this game is more of the same crap youve done in every other rpg youve ever played. everything from the go to point a to kill beastie to go to point b and get me a thingy. nothing about this game really screams innovation, and even the voice powers work so much like any other castable ability that it might as well be mandatory spell casting on the par of a quick cast ability in diablo. so i wouldnt suggest anyone spend 30 dollars on this title. you can spend a fraction of that and pick up oblivion, which has far better writing, exponetially better content, and have a game playable to the nth degree. whereas skyrim basically amounts to a graphical update to oblivion (all the tes games since morrowind use the same graphics engine, with upgrades between launches) without all the depth and immersion. so in short, i would not recommend anyone spend more than 20 usd on this title unless they are a die hard tes fan that simply must see the new content.",126.4
"i used to play  games like you, but then i took a skyrim to the computer.",259.6

"skyrim is a great game. you dont need me to tell you that though, its metacritic score is through the roof and im sure youve had at least one friend gushing about it. the reason skyrim is great isnt its amazing graphics or fantastic story. skyrim is great because it lets you play. so many games try to force you down linear corridors, and try to tell you who you are. skyrim lets you be who you want to be. want to be a criminal, wandering the wilderness and killing passers by? go for it! want to be a brilliant wizard set on saving the world from dragons? you can do that too. there are limits of course, but the elder scrolls has always done a great job drawing the line. not trying to do too much and making sure the game play is still solid, but catering to as many people as possible. ive been playing the elder scrolls series since the first in the series and theyve all been great, often ahead of their time. skyrim is the best to date, and the pinnacle of the open world game.",82.6
"while your trying to save the town from dragons and the destruction they cause, the towns people are trying to kill you, yeah, what a great game!",84.4
"this is the best game i have ever played, i think. lol just buy the game. now!",57.2
"i tried to play this game in the past on the ps3, but i hated it because i couldnt get past the helgen keep. this time on pc i stuck with it, and now i really regret not going this far until now. skyrim is awesome, and has so many little secrets and things that make it really stand out. the only problems i have with it are: bugs (partially fixed by unofficial patches) and lack of variety in dungeons. there are nordic temples, dwarven cities, and a few others, but a lot of them look the same to me. ive only played for 70 hours as of now so perhaps that could change. i would also say something about mods, but my computer cant handle dat . also: dragon priests are cool",12.5

"i do not believe this is a game...its a life experience.",293.6
"still even when near 2015 it remains a fantastic game. i think it is because, unlike a lot of developers rushing games out, bethesda really took their time. this is why when you look at games that took longer to make, leaving duke nukem forever out of this, they are a whole lot better. compare the elder scroll or grand theft auto franchise to call of duty or battlefield, tes and gta are better. they also last a lot longer when playing, not bored right away. ill admit i play cod quite often, but i sure play skyrim and gta a whole lot more. people already want another tes, even though eso just came out not too long ago.(eso sucks in my opinion, but i pretty sure its because it is their first attempt at a mmo.) so stop asking for another tes, if they release too soon it will suck, give it time.",96.7

"skyrim is a great game that really gets you hooked in and makes you want to play the story more and more as you play it. skyrim is also open to steam workshop so mods are really easy to install and the game is really well optimized so i dont thimk anyone should get any lag what so ever",86.7

"this game is rather dull, grey colors, honestly it feels like they are flaunting the fact that it has dragons. the level up systems feels kinda dull and there isnt much to it, making the characters feel very cut and paste, along with not having much filling the world. i would advise anyone get morrowind or oblivion rather than play this.",85.5

"this game is just to amazing not to play, especially if you like a very good rpg with a great story and action to it. the game is has alot of content in the regular campaign and in the dlc content you can buy with it, you will never really get board of the game because the massive amount of mods and i mean massive. the mods for this game verys from funny mods like a playable chicken character to very cool player homes and etc. so if you have 20$ on your steam and you have no ideas what to get i recomend the elder scrolls v: skyrim to you",36.0

(awesome music!favorite is when they go like, dovakhin, dovakhin, da da..... whatever...) i highly reccomend it! its totally worth your money! one of my favorite games! 9.5/10",57.8
"great game over all one of the best. although i do admit, i like obilvion better(vanilla wise), skyrim is also amazing. what makes this game so great that could even beat obvilion is the use of mods. this game has so much mod support that it just makes this great game, the best it can be. not to mention, its easy to devote so much time in it. if you feel like playing a game you can emerse yourself in and play however you want. i would strongly recommend this game.",146.4
"i love this game. its simple beauty lies in the amount of control the player has over how they play. skyrim is a different game for each person, whether you like to play as a mage, a warrior, or a thief. with seemingly never-ending quests and objectives, youll never grow bored of this game, because even if you cant find anything more to do, creating a new character creates an entirely new game and a new series of adventures. trust me when i say its really hard to get tired of this game. to top it off, the graphics are amazing, and bethesdas new engine is gentle even to some underpowered systems. i cant recommend this game enough.",163.3

"have played this alot, but had it cracked until now (which is why my achievments are so wierd). the whole elder scrolls series is a masterpiece, feels so alive and is very immersive. the lore is great, the quests are great, the graphics are great and for the first time in a elder scrolls game: the combat is actually great! would highly recommend this except if you are searching for a competitive or online game.",35.7
"my first elder scrolls game that ive played, what can i say?! its just awesome!!!",197.7
"great game with great and sometimes funny mods. i also like the fact that if you dont want to be in a specific group like the dark brotherhood you dont have to... i completly and utterly distroyed the person who kidnapped me =d though, i do wish that the developer and or writers could have included some type of romance, as i find it hard to believe that someone would marry you just because you are wearing a necklace and did a favor for them.",170.9

"i would recommend this game to anyone who likes open world games. i completed every questline, dlc and faction on the xbox 360 for this game and just had to buy it for pc too. in fact love tes so much i bought the anthology. this game is great, it can get addictive and is easy to rack up hours of playing. if microsoft measured hours of play time on the xbox, i would surely be in the thousands and i cant wait to play it all over again on the pc. i love this game so much, it has great artistic design, which creates a great visual experience. the game also adapts to the player as yuo progress and become stronger, so do your enemies, so youll never run out of challenging oppents. there is so much to explore that you cant help but keep playing! so strap yourself in because this game will keep you up till 4/5 am with enjoyment and will keep you indoors for days on end, even on the brightest of days. this is a game that is easy to fall in love with. so what are you waiting for, love it already!",25.0

"this game i pretty good.but it isnt as previous tes games.this game holds your hand more because bethesda targeted a casual audience since they need more money to stay afloat.if you liked it in morrowind that you were really able to change the story line by your actions you wont be able to do that in this game.all in all it still has some fun story in it and its a good game to spend your time on.but beware:it isnt like the previous tes games.",56.0
"the elder scrolls are one of the few fantasy games that i come across that is build around the idea of modding the game. while other companies put limitation beshesda open there game to others. from adding armors,clothing,characters,quest,even dlc quality mods. there are very few games out there that are made by other companies with the idea of giving tools and power to the players to create and improve their game. its clear that other companies should take notes of this. even if its not easy to build your game around this idea of freedom its would be wise to attemp such an act. i have over 1000 hours in skyrim alone. so i speak from experience when i say that this game continues to deliver. i trully hope other major companies start to pratice this developement style.",1229.6

"really good game. havent even downloaded any of the content from the workshop and i already spent over 75 hours on this game. just a huge sandbox for you to play in. ive played oblivion on my xbox360 console and i have to say that this game is much better. just the graphics, combat and overall experience. i have very high expectations for the next elder scrolls game.",80.3
"even though this is almost 4 years old now, i find it more enjoyable than the current newer releases albeit if you use mods. speaking of which, ive been spending more time modding it rather than playing the damn game lol. money well worth spent with infinite as well as enjoyable replay value.",640.4

"this game is rather dull, grey colors, honestly it feels like they are flaunting the fact that it has dragons. the level up systems feels kinda dull and there isnt much to it, making the characters feel very cut and paste, along with not having much filling the world. i would advise anyone get morrowind or oblivion rather than play this.",85.5

"whats to say about elders scrolls that hasnt been said before, this would have to be on my top 5 games of all time. the whole concept of the games drags you in for hours on end, and with the downloadable content and modder community this game will remain one of my favourites for a long time to come",147.6
"you havent known freedom, until you have run around a field collecting butterfly wings because thats what you wanted to do. you havent known badass, until you saunter up riding a dragon whilst hurling fireballs at people. you havent known epic, until you have fought two dragons at once on a frozen lake that is crumbling beneath your boots. you havent known class, until you have had fisticuffs with mud crabs wearing top hats and monocles. you havent known power, until you have went full liam neeson on bandits who have kidnapped your family. you havent known the atmosphere, until you have been hit by a giant at low level. you havent known frustrating, until you have had lydia block your doorway. you havent known an  kicking, until you have fought the ebony knight. you havent known drunk until youve stolen a goat from a giant, ran around the land naked and get married to a hag raven all in the same night with the god of debauchery. you havent known life until you have experienced skyrim. 10/10 would relive again.",48.3

"very good sandbox+rpg. if you like to grind, collect loot, sell your loot, do quests, kill bandits, hunt animals, make weapons, make potions, pry into the lives of npcs, ride a horse, kill dragons, etc... this game is probably for you. bad points about this game? well... it evolves very slow, you will be facing for a long time same kind of enemies, wearing the same armor until new one is unlocked and you will discover that really there is not point to work in some areas/specializations if your are not totally focused on them (so think very carefull at start the kind of character that you wan to build). the history of the main campaing lacks of epicness... i feel some sidequest are more enjoyable/fun than the main story.",60.5

"this was a very fun game. you can explore the world and after you complete the quests you can still walk around and do what you want. i would recomend the game to anyone who likes to do what they want. this game, you can play how you want, when you want, what you want. there are many classes to choose from. you can explore the world how you like, kill things, and do quests for evil. overall a very good game.",287.6
"this game is an excellent portrayal of what bethesda softworks is capable of. combining a massive amount of quests with an open world, there is plenty to keep you playing the elder scrolls v for hours on end. plus, its cheaper now and the legendary edition is a great buy, containing every single dlc.",165.1

"theres a lot of love for the elder scrolls series, and as someone thats played daggerfall, morrowind, and oblivion, i have to reluctantly say this was my least favorite of the series. the story line does not compell me, nothing in the game really gives me any real reason to care about the overall plot. the dialogue is stiff and feels archiac in the modern age of cinematic gaming. and worst of all, the gameplay hasnt evolved, aside from a pretty skill tree id say its regressed in a lot of significant ways. the combat is the worst part of all, i was so excited to kill a dragon for the first time and it was easily one of the most bitter disappointments i experienced. it doesnt react to your attacks, it just sort of unceremoniously coils over and disintigrates into ash. theres no rewarding feeling in any of the combat, and to me the fact that these titles havent evolved since 2001 indicates to me a philosophical issue where the developers feel theyre unable to make a truly great game. i did put about 40 hours into the game which is generally seen as a paltry amount for any game in the elderscrolls series, but it was enough for me to know it wasnt a rewarding experience.",28.7

"i must tell you now: if you havent played this game, you fail as a gamer. if you havent tried the many mods, you fail (just a little). what makes the elder scroll series so amazing is the amazing story telling and modding community. the story starts off the same as other tes titles, you are a prisoner and then after some miraculous event, freed and nobody cares and it turns out you are some amazing person destined for awesome things. the modding community takes everything up to 11, from redrawn textures to entire dlc sized packs and rescripted events (like a civil war that actually has fights). so if you are still thinking, stop and suit up dragonborn and start fus-ro-dahing your enimies off the next cliff (or having the dragons sound like randy savage with macho mods oh yeah!)",206.8

"as long as bethesda is gone keep their horrible pc interfaces it will never be a good game. oblivion, fallout 3, this one... its like they have all that awfull interface, is it so difficult to get a good interface on pc and not that stupid console port? how many sales do they need to have finally a playable interface like most real rpgs on pc. give us a kind of mmorpg interface. guild wars 2 for example... rpgs are played with mouses not pads! lucky for me i have a g11 and g602 to be able to macro a lot of buttons. the combat is slightly better then oblivion with finishing moves added. i really enjoy the dungeons but get annoyed by the towns. some little adds are nice like finding treasure maps and more. auto level scaling is still the major problem for me but is less obvious then in oblivion. anyway the game needs to be modded, without mods i would never recommend this game, but lucky for us there are so many good people around that do the work for bethesda to make the game a bit more enjoyable, but even now i find it still a bit early, this game will probably perfect in about 2 years, i hated oblivion at start and loved it 3-4 years later with 50 mods installed. dlcs are a bit better then oblivion where we had stupid things like mage tower and other crap. 5/10 standard 8/10 with many mods and many hours to install them...",12.7

"a lot has been said about skyrim, and i wont start reiterating. from my own experiences, skyrim did not achieve what it was tasked to do: creating an immersive world. dont get me wrong, it is still a good game, but it is not space rangers. mostly the problem is that the game is crafted for the player. the world is a stage, a facade, and the npc:s are actors on it. there are no events outside the players control and the world does not feel vibrant and lively. i understand that requesting a living, dynamic game world is unreasonable for a game with as intensive graphics as skyrim, but still... but yes, skyrim is the best elder scrolls-type game yet made. it is a very pretty sandbox full to the brim with detail and places to go. it is a sandbox adventure game of best quality. and a roleplaying game of mediocre level, at best.",122.1

"this game does not have levitation. this game does not have spellcrafting. this game has immersion breaking fast travel. this game has the dreaded quest markers. this game has limited and repetitive dialogue. this game is set in a flat, grey, and bleak environment. this game is amazing. 10/10.",392.8
"an amazing and gorgeous game, especially when you throw in a few top rated mods. absolutely recommended if you enjoy open ended rpgs.",257.8
"ive mostly play this on the 360, but this is a great game for if you wanted to kill a whole bunch of time. there is so much you can do in this epic! though, it does get really, really repeatitive. i still have a blast with it though! you should check it out if you have not yet.",36.6
"its fun to explore the huge world. play heavily modded for best experience, especially if you like to play as a mage.",612.3
"i like it. cant play it right now because i modded it too hard, but its a good game, aside from the poor optimization.",221.4
"this is without a doubt the best game i have ever played. coupling my play time on steam and a rough estimate on my xbox ive racked up around 200 - 250 hours on skyrim, maybe more and i am not bored of it yet. the graphics, the storyline, the characters... its all so beautifully constructed, with the aid of the thousands of mods avaliable across the interwebs, and in most places beautifully written i cant help but keep going back to it time after time after time. my favourite part about skyrim is the dawnguard dlc. even though were dealing with vampires here (no spoilers intended) i find the storyline, in some parts, quite touching and overall it is something i think is 99% perfect. i would definitely recommend the elder scrolls franchise as a whole, and if you havent bought any of the games buy them right now and prepare to never go outside again.",162.5
"long version:best game ever! i have 55 hours into this and i didnt even do any dlc and im still doing the main quests this game is awesome i would advise to get the legendary edition but if not the regular version is still awesome! also i advise to get the mod frost fall and eat sleep bathe drink and showers in inns audio overhaul nonstop fire wood chopping and hunterborn touring carriages (look it up) great mods without giving you op stuff makes the game better. short version:this game is awesome if you havent gotten get it! for 10 bucks thats a great deal get the legenedary edition if possible but the regular game is still great :d",119.2
"the single best open world rpg ever made. one of the best rpgs ever made. if you havent played skyrim youre doing yourself a disservice. if you havent played skyrim for pc, but have it on console - it is worth getting it for pc. the added fidelity, as well as mods really add a significant amount to the game to make you come back. i have logged just as much time on console (360) as pc.",39.5

"this game is amazing even with or without dlcs, but for mods or other content i should recommend getting to legendary edition. i havent even hit the limit of completing all the side/main quest so it makes the game make you play 500+ hours. i honesly would recommend this game to anyone that a fan of roly playing gamer or not a fan of them. for a 2011 game its still better then most games now.",116.5

"i am usually a man of words, but this game is beyond mere descriptions i can give. the preplexities of emotions in a beatiful symphony that it radiates is more than i can explain, it redefines immerision. its more than just a fictional part of life, no, this game is real and its alive. the final part in the elder scrolls is a great ending to an amazing saga, bethesda really made this game their last, and it was one hell of a finale. it all sounds very cliche, but it is a part of your life youll need to experience. highly recommend this to anyone.",827.7

"what an absolutely gorgeous game! vanilla the game is great, but add the mods from the mod community on steam as well as the nexus mod manager and you have a game that will last you for ages! i cant believe how many hours i have already put in to this game. the graphic enhancements and the the gameplay modifications add so much to the game! i cant recommend this game enough. i havent played any multiplayer game in a while, normally i would be craving to play a multiplayer game after playing a single player game, but now i cant wait to jump in to the game after work lol. its so good! if you did get this game or planning on buying it, do yourself a favour and buy the dawnguard dlc as well",222.2

"i love this game! lots of adventuring and exploring",5.8

"not a great fan of bethesdas work after the ruined my childhood years of gaming with fallout 3. bethesda does the standard bit in this game of hiring three or four voice actors to do a few hundred characters, and the whole mushy-irradiated-face you get to customize at the beginning. this game even comes with the standard bethesda dlc options that are downright unplayable by some estimation. so why am i giving a recommendation? steam workshop. the mod community, the gamers themselves, have seen the promise in this game and made it their own. as well, i can say this is the first bethesda game that has not out-right turned me away because i loathed the leveling system. i didnt like the idea of hopping around in the woods for 30 minutes in order to level stats. seemed stupid. however, this game has a decent leveling system and great mod support so you can have the adventure you crave.",159.3

"this is a great open world style rpg, that is very immersive. in this game you fight dragons, barbarians, vampires, witches and so much more, all within the first 10 hours. this game is here to impress, with a great combat system and choices that actually mean something, e.g. do you join the stormcloaks or the imperials?, this is a tough choice as either can change the game quite a bit. another great thing is that you can do things at your leasure, so if you get bored doing the main sort of story, you can start a sidequest or two like the thieves guild or the dark brotherhood quests, which are a very fulfilling part of the game. no matter what there is always something to do, with dungeons refreshing every few days, and if you start playing with all of the dlc, well you have a heck of an adventure waiting for you. if you want my opinion of a score out of 10, i would give it a pretty much perfect 9.5/10.",114.1

"definetly one of my favorite games of all time! if you like the elder scrolls franchise, or just like adventure, buy this game now!sure its glitchy, but if you overlook that, it is so fun! its an open world with a seemingly endless amount fo side quests. i recomend this game to anyone and everyone. you can play this game for years and not do everything. i have owned this game for a couple years, (on xbox and pc) and have only scratched the surface of what you can do inthis game.theres the mages college for mages. theres the dark brotherhood for assasins theres the theives guild for theives. sorry if this is turning into a gush fest, but if you are considering playing this game, do it! buy it. you wont be disapointed",36.1
"skyrim is a great game overall. it has a lot of terrian to explore as well as a crap ton of side quest that you can do, instead of the main storyline. the graphics look good, as far as i can tell (my graphics card only lets me put it on medium so...) the main storyline keeps you hooked for as long as you can go. i highly recommend trying out skyrim, it is as great continuation of the elder scrolls series.",75.5
"i find this game repetitive and dull, there are fun aspects in it but i feel that when you have gone into one cave filled with either zombies or bandits, youve been to then all, they are always laid out differently but they all look the same and they all have the same enemies in them so it becomes repetitive. ps: pro tip for fighting a dragon, it doesnt matter how strong you or the dragon is, just stand behind a rock and shoot it and it cant hit you.",51.7

"welll dont get why you would not like this game it has a good story it has to many mods that just make the game alot more fun. if you are done with the story line and you dont know what to do thare are alot of side quests to go on or just get a dlc like dawnguard one more thing thare are alot of easter eggs and secret npcs and items to find.",157.5

"this is an amazing game and i could reccomend it to any fan of the rpg genre. the character customization is amazingly good, as is the gameplay. you have a large veriety of weapons and skills to use. not a fan of melee weapons? use magic. that sword to weak for you? warhammer. this game allows you to choose the paths you walk, you decide your life. tons of different dialog options that get unique reactions from the npcs, each one with their own personality and things to say. there are multiple different factions too. the companions, who are noble fighters. the thieves guild, a bunch of thieves who have a surprisingly complex storyline. the dark brotherhood, a group of assassins... and many more. this game has hundreds, maybe even thousands of hours worth playing. and the dlc only makes it better somehow. although the games has its flaws and occasional bugs, its well worth the money and you should definetally spend time playing it.",278.3

"put 120 hours into the ps3 version and got the platinum. after only 2 hours of playing the pc version, i already encountered a quest i had never seen before. even without including the vast mod and community support, this game is an expansive, deep, and gratifying experience. highly recommended.",50.8

"theres not much to say about skyrim since everyone knows about it and what it is. its the best at being an rpg that makes you want to meticulously get everything just perfect for your character, its nuts. even after all this time ive played it, i still havent beaten the main story line because ive been too busy clearing out caves and doing really fun side quests. every gamer should play skyrim at least once in their life.",145.0
"love playing around with mods on this game, still prefer a mod manager to the steam workshop tho.",83.3
"excelent game! the game world has tons of places to visit and things to do even if you want to ignore the main questlines, but you will want to do them too since they are well crafted. the mod community on this one is huge and well worth looking into. there are so many mods ranging from aesthetic to animations, content, convenience, audio, etc. that you can make the game into whatever you prefer. often times the mods are made so as to not destroy the intended content of the game, they just make it more to your liking. i personally like it more than morrowind and oblivion (especially since leveling is no longer like the atrocity it was in oblivion). you can make your character whatever you like; wether that be tanky, sneaky, mage-y, a mix of the above, or anything you want. you could even max all skills if you really wanted to then just swap out gear i suppose. highly recommended if you are a fan of rpgs.",143.6

"this game is fine if you have never played an elder scrolls game before, or have no care what so ever about the story and setting of nirn. otherwise it is a peice of excriment that does all it can to taint each and every part of one of the most unique settings ive seen in fantasy.",154.8
"this game.... if you enjoy fantasy or if you dont i still recommend it. the story is great even though ive never finished it, because around every corner and in every town i find something else that distracts me and takes me far away from whatever i was doing. these small cryptic notes and clues everywhere makes the world so much mysterious you will find it hard to get bored or run out of things to do. as this is a game about discovery and exploration i can honestly tell you no game pulls it off quite like skyrim. and even though it looks like i havent played much most of my game time wasnt recorderd and ive actually spent ~200 hours in game",55.8
"skyrim: most addictive game ever, i spent 3 hole days playing this game with out stoping and i havent even scrached the surface of this game yet, i highly recomend this game to people who like games were they chose how there charcter looks, the abilitys he can use and who they side with, this game is probably the best game i have ever played and i will continue to play this game until i die",213.1

"decent game, but the pc version isnt without console-ridden features that annoy mouse/keyboard users like myself. hopefully a modder will address this issue. skyrim in no way threatens morrowind goty as my all-time favorite elder scrolls game. there is some fun to be had in skyrim but be warned its very streamlined and built for the masses instead of niche open world rpg lovers specifically. the price at $60 is a bit steep but you can get many hours out of this game, despite bugs and streamlining, and numerous annoying console-esque run-ins with the interface/menu.",1137.1
"if you are looking for a good rpg look no futher for skyrim will satisfy all your role-playing needs. after 3 years of it bing out i still play skyrim and it appears that quite a few other people do to, skyrim still has a very popular and diverse modding comunity and after all this time it has not even reached its peak. a+++ for bethesda gg.",422.4
"oh yeah... this game is the real deal. i my self have never played elder scrolls, when i heard everyone going nuts over skyrim i decided to buy it and see if it was worth the hype, and oh my god it deffs was. this game is more then amazing, this is one of the best game i have played in my life. this game offers so many hours of gameplay time! deffs worth buying!",52.3

"this is the best game ever. the gameplay, the grafics and the story!!! i love it!",76.5
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"imagine fallout: new vegas. cover it with snow, take out the fire weapons and fill it with medieval ones. sprinkle it with dragons, other fantasy monsters and horses, and youll get something not far from skyrim. vanilla skyrim is a good game. it could have been the best game made, but tries to cover such an enormous terrain, such an absurd amount of quests, it necessarily had to end up filled to the brim with bugs, unsolvable quests and various other glitches. luckily for everybody, bethesda decided to make this another of the moddable games, resulting in a nearly flawless epic adventure that you can customize to your own tastes. more dragons, no dragons, more quests, more provinces, more spells, more houses to buy or build and call your home. theres pretty much nothing you wont be able to find a mod for. the result is an amazing experience where you can put hundreds of hours with a single character (and not even counting the dlcs) while collecting items, exploring the bazillon dungeons all over skyrim, comleting quests, or generally exploring the biggest game world ive ever seen. in short, this is as good as a game can be to put your money in.",215.0

"this game is amazing, one of the most immersive itles ive ever played. a massive map where you can spend years on the game and not come anywhere near to completing the story, sure its a little broken but still the game alone will have you busy for a long time but with mods? the possibilities are endless 9/10",141.2
"if you have ever played skyrim on the xbox or playstation... you are in for a treat! load screens take much less time, mods are at your command, and making the game what you always dreamed of is just around the corner. there are tons of mods to make the game just like you want it involving more spells, better graphics, more armor, more weapons, and the list can go on and on. without a doubt one of the best rpg games available still today and you dont have to pay $15 a month like you do with eso. once again 10/10 could play over and over again.",6.8
"one of the few single player games that you will definatly keep playing even if you finished the main story. lots to loot, stab, shot, and cumbust into flames. one does not simply stop playing skyrim with out having a daydream of heroicly saving a town from a dragon, going into a dwemer ruin, or even marching into the thalmor embasy and unleashing the proper devastating hell on the thalmor. despite what people say about oblivion. this isnt oblivion, its skyrim. different game. if they want a game like oblivion then play oblivion, leave skyrim out of your foundest memories of oblivion in oblivion or morrowind whatever. let other people have there memories with skyrim. you can recomend oblivion or other elder scroll games, but keep the rant to yourself and let others enjoy atleast one elder scroll game.",965.0

(ive put over 200 hours into this game pc: not all on the steam version so im gonna review the unmodded version -bad story (repetive with the civil war part) -glitchy at times -bad graphics (what else would you expect from a bethesda game using that ol beefed up morrowind engine) -many boring fetch quests (same in new vegas) -meh combat. it feels like im hitting air some of the quests were well thought out and pretty fun. the enemies were pretty repetive like the draugr in the dungeons and the god damn dragons. reccommended for modding purposes not reccomended for vanilla. get oblivion. so much better and more immersive than this game",30.7
"don;t normally have a favorite on pc or console when it comes to games, but if your pc can run it on high or better id say grab skyrim for pc. being able to mod the game gives it an infinite time limit on playability. get bored of the main game? download a mod that changes the story or adds a side-story to the game. want your character to really stand out amongst the rabble? get some armor/weapon mods. dont like the leveling up system? download an xp mod. i think you get the gist of it. skyrim on pc > console.",166.1
"graphics: fantastic outdoor locations make sure you have hd textures downloaded for the best experience, i still stop and stare at the mountains from time to time :d 9/10 story: like most es games the main story can be ignored and adventuring and side questing can be had! 9/10 gameplay: the first person hack and slash combat does feel a little weird like your slicing air... but its still fun enough its always fun to play with shouts and experiment with them as well. spells are great and look really nice too. random encounters are pretty cool but they are few and far between. the questing bugs are also really annoying sometimes npcs dont trigger a certain event and you are a bit on the stuck side >_> 8/10 replay value: tons of replay value here customizing new characters and choosing to do things differentlly will be prominent in your skyrim experience. 10/10",58.2

"better than sex, probably has prevented a lot of it too.",98.6
"this is truly one of my all-time favourite role-playing games. this game is immensely immersive, the game its self has so much to do i doubt in the time that i have actually played it that i have even scratched the surface. the game itself includes amazing visuals and with the free hi-res texture pack add-on it can be even be more visually appealing. the story is absolutely outstanding i have had so much fun with this game i would recommend it to absolutely anyone. as a side note i am an avid fallout fan and i assumed that i would not enjoy playing this game but i proved myself wrong.",70.9
"have you ever wanted to fight dragons? live in a fantasy world? or maybe be a adventure, well this game sure does give you the experience of having these, its one of the greatest rpgs ive ever played, and i recommend that you take a shot in the world of the skyrim",73.4
"an extremely shallow rpg. the ui is a mess, clearly designed for ease of access on consoles. quests are barely more than fetch this and that or kill him, with little dialogue to encourage the character from a roleplaying standpoint, and feels so repetitive that its dull to play. it honestly plays more like a first person arpg, but lacks the depth of a well fleshed out combat system to support the lack of depth in characters and lore. the engine is showing its age, and is wrought with bugs. textures are small and sometimes simply mapped wrong. everything feels copy and pasted, like this was done by an intern looking to prove he could work with the engine. community mods might be enough to save this, but for now, id stick with morrowind. if you are a fan of easy gameplay and immersive bloom filled graphics take precedence over dialogue and story, play this. if you want a deep, fulfilling rpg that you wont mind replaying 5 years from now, save your money and look elsewhere.",99.9
"bir daar kred! (the dragon shout for buy this game, im not kidding look it up.)",11.0
"if you do not own this game ; get it now. it is the best game ever.",294.3

"im more than 250 hours into this game and still going strong. it has some minor issues with bugs and for awhile it was causing me some serious nausea (thank goodness for camera sway mods) but the storyline is steller and the world is huge and immersive. the game lives up to the hype and anyone who enjoys beautiful visuals, a solid storyline, quality voice acting and a realistic and open world should get skyrim asap.",465.1
"their arent even words to describe the addictiveness",95.3
"what do you get if you take oblivions aesthetics and trim out the fat and extraneous elements, take morrowinds vast amount of stuff to stumble upon in your explorations, and then make the combat not suck? well probably a mess given oblivion is a piece of software and therefore not possessed of fatty lipids to trim out, so now you probably have lard all over your floor or something and that greasy crap is really hard to scrub out plus itll go rancid and everything. oh yeah skyrims pretty good also.",304.1
"one of the best games ever made. there only a few misses like the main quest its not that much fun and a little short, and the grapics and ui are a bit lacking but you can mod the game. but overall its probably the best rpg youll find for now",77.4
"skyrim is defenitely one of the best games ive ever played. the story, the awesome and big as hell open world, the way your actions have consequences, the almost infinite quests and all the awesome armor and weapons and other cool stuff you can find in this world is what makes this games almost perfect!",63.7
"skyrim is one of the best games ive played, ive been a fan of the elder scrolls since morrowind and every game they bring out seems to be more bigger than the other, iam always blown away.",139.6
"the elder scrolls series have always been one of my favorite game series. a huge world, fully voiced npcs, tons of quests, engaging combat and infinite reasons to replay it. add that with the open modding community and you have a seemingly immortal game. they improved the combat alot in the game, added new possible play styles and improved the overall a.i. its got a few nostalgia bits in it aswell as tons of new content. its really a one of a kind experience. your adventure awaits!",276.6
"half the fun of the game is the mods lol if you ever get bored just go to the workshop and enjoy.",234.0
"i totally recommend this game to any fans of the elder scrolls series or anyone whos new to the series. my favorite part about skyrim is the exploration aspect--although its world is not as bright as those of morrowind or cyrodiil, it has its many charms that make it such a great game. i recommend that you buy the game with all dlcs and get the official high res texture pack. and one more thing: get mods. even though the vanilla game has lots of content that will keep you occupied for many, many hours, you may get bored at some point. i highly recommend mods that add dlc-sized content like falskaar and wyrmstooth and those that improve the look of skyrim, especially enb, smim, ruins clutter improved, etc.",181.5

"one of the best elder scrolls game out, the base game has a great main quest line and if you get bored of that you have 100s+ side quests to do, or you could go around finding little hiddle spots around the map. the dawnguard dlc is fun and gives you alot more side quests with a good main quest line. but the best dlc so far has to be the dragonborn dlc im still going through doing the black books i mean theres alot of stuff to do so you wont get bored with the plot and say omg this sucks why did i even buy it because i love it. overall the game is great, plus all the mods you can download really gives the game alot of life and stuff to do. i give this game a perfect 10/10 an amazing game please do buy.",49.4
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim brings several new things to the table, but also detracts from many of the facets of the tes series that were present in oblivion and morrowind. the graphics, combat, and magic aspects of the game have increased tremendously, while the storyline to pretty much garbage, the guilds are only a shadow of the fighters guild or mages guild from the previous games, and the new skill system discourages private role playing. i give it a 10/10 wait, what? yeah, i just gave it a 10/10, dispite all the bad things i just mentioned. but why would you do that?? simple! like the previous games in the series, there is no shortage of game-changing mods available to the players. simply search the steam workshop or install the skyrim nexuss mod manager and add any mods that will improve on the game play! skyrim itself may not be a perfect game- hell, its farther from it that morrowind or oblivion- but the players ability to make it a perfect game puts skyrim on my top 10 games list. whatever you feel the game lacks, you can improve on!",390.5
"fun game, you can run around and kill . you level your dovahkiin up, fight dragons and kill more . great with mods.",48.2
"skyrim is yet another amazing release from bethesda. vanilla skyrim is fun enough but i definitely recommend getting into mods, even for just the retexturing and scenery alone. theres an amazing community behind this game, the lore is decent, and theres almost never a time when theres nothing to do, and when you think youve run out of things to do, there are mods to add more things. hooray for things!",35.8

"another extension of the ongoing game series known as the elder scrolls. while the only other elder scroll game i have touched was oblivion, i still say skyrim is the best one so far. the game immediately throws you into the land of skyrim. for the most part, you are taught the basics of the game (how to move, attack, equip your gear etc) early on. however, after you finish the tutorial (really, it was more just getting accustomed to the game rather than teaching you vital things), youre given infinite choices. there are no chains holding you back from doing what you please. whether you want to start leveling up your professions, following the main story line, going questing, or simply traversing the land of skyrim is all to your own discretion. what i simply love about this game is that there are no limits put on what you are (un)able to do. the only downside to all this is the bugs you will inevitably come across. despite all of that though, i still find this a great game.",121.3

"there are good games.. and there are great games skyrim is the best game.",128.5
"this is one of the buggiest, most broken, most unfinished-feeling games i have seen in a long time. it would take a very special game to make me look past all the (really glaring) issues and still have fun, and skyrim is one of those games. it captures the feeling of adventure, of exploration, of excitement over the smallest things, more than most any games ive ever played. wouldnt call it a masterpiece, but its most definitely worth your time and money. (plus the game is extremely moddable, so youre getting a potentially limitless amount of playthroughs without it feeling stale, not even mentioning the entirely new games people have made with the engine. bumps up the value quite considerably, in my opinion.)",144.1

"this is a pretty poor rpg. really simple mechanics that dont work, terrible consolized ui, lazy copy paste setting and story (what happened to the alien wonders and great plot of morrowind?) yes this game is fun with mods but there is no excuse for the release version to be so bad....",74.7
"its a sandbox action game. some how besthesda managed to strip out the role playing from the game even further than they did with oblivion. good as a hack and slash fantasy game. bad as an entry in the tes series.",34.6

"i managed to leave this game when i finished the main quest. i spent only like a 100 hours on it. that was a torrent download. i was so proud of myself because everyone else was spending thousands of hours on this game. i thought they were stupid. i knew they were stupid. then i bought this game on a sale on steam in september 2014. its 2029 and im still playing this game. i am stupid. 10/10",1.5
"this game is amazing, it has tons of content, it has an awesome open world and it keeps me busy for hours. this game is a masterpiece of rpg, with so many people you can meet so many quest you can do and so many annoying people you can kill. but the best thing of this game is, that it is fully moddable and the community makes mods without end. with the mods you have the abbility to design your game how you want it, you want a game where dragons are difficult? then download something like deadly dragons.you want a completle different skill-system? then download a skill overhaul mod. you want to make your game to look like crysis? then download an enb. you want to have an errection and controll it with the arrow keys? then download a very special mod :3 vanilla 8/10 modded: 100 000/10",147.8
"okay, i will give skyrim the obligatory recommendation. whats there to say? another sprawling bethesda epic. the only somewhat legitimate criticism ive seen about skyrim is regarding how bethesda tends to release games full of bugs thinking that users will come up with mod fixes. i dont know about that as i cant say ive ever played a bethesda title i considered broken. what i will say is that users in the steam workshop have come up with some truly incredible mods. deducting a point from bethesda is one way to look at it but i say giving people the freedom to use steam workshop gives them a point right back. the fact that it is a game so many people feel compelled to create so many mods for speaks volumes. bethesda must be doing something right.",126.6

"theres a lot of love for the elder scrolls series, and as someone thats played daggerfall, morrowind, and oblivion, i have to reluctantly say this was my least favorite of the series. the story line does not compell me, nothing in the game really gives me any real reason to care about the overall plot. the dialogue is stiff and feels archiac in the modern age of cinematic gaming. and worst of all, the gameplay hasnt evolved, aside from a pretty skill tree id say its regressed in a lot of significant ways. the combat is the worst part of all, i was so excited to kill a dragon for the first time and it was easily one of the most bitter disappointments i experienced. it doesnt react to your attacks, it just sort of unceremoniously coils over and disintigrates into ash. theres no rewarding feeling in any of the combat, and to me the fact that these titles havent evolved since 2001 indicates to me a philosophical issue where the developers feel theyre unable to make a truly great game. i did put about 40 hours into the game which is generally seen as a paltry amount for any game in the elderscrolls series, but it was enough for me to know it wasnt a rewarding experience.",28.7

"amazing, engaging and just spectacular. you can have fun with this game for ages, i have only just started the game and have already put in 70+ hours. skyrim will keep you entertained with a show of combat mechanics and npc interaction. of course how could you resist a game with dragons in it after all?",314.1
"yes!!! this game is great!!! the quests are spectacular, the story is epic, and there are so many side quests that it will take lots of your time to find them all, but worth it! the combat can be unoriginal at times, but overall it gets a 9.5/10!",78.3
"this game is so much fun. the environments are varied and epic. tons of quest, freeform adventuring and the auto director generates just enough content to make it interesting to slow-travel.",115.6
"its great with mods that completly break the game and make it alot more easy",164.5
"if u love rpg games and open, world this is it.... this is it! i have spent 105 hours on this game and im still not bored and i have probably played it like 3 times and i still love it. there is so much to do. finish the story do side missions, finish the side missions go and help some people, finished helping people get some mods for more missions or more, finished getting the mods then... wait how there is millions of mods and even if u did get all of them wait for new ones. this game is endless so just get it!",113.0
"this game is one of the best rpgs out there, if not the best. nearly endless quests and literally endless ways to beat the game. warning: very addictive and time consuming.",178.3
"great looking beautiful game highly recommended for mmo lovers but at least in my case i wuld wait for it to go on sale because it is usually 50-75% off from $20 but it is a great amazing game, and when you add workshop mods to that mix it becomes an awsome game that is really hard to put down",60.3
"flipping awesome and its huge too many things to do so many things to see",358.6
"skyrim is a great game for people who like rpgs and being able to make their own choices and having lots of fun mods to screw around with",4.4
"this is the only game i have ever played where living like a peasant and earning an honest living and camping in tents and making sure you dont freeze to death and saving up enough to buy a horse is more fun than being the hero you are supposed to be. for best results do not play actual questline",202.3
"honestly one of the best games in this generation. it has been the one game to hold my attention for almost 3 years now. i originally bought it for xbox and again now for pc. i would rate it very highly due to its stunning graphics, dynamic quests and captivating story. it lacks simple get this item quests and replaces them interesting dungeons that each have their own story which if you take the time can be fascinating. followers and npcs seem more intellegent than other games and the dlcs add depth and a whole new story. if you play this game, expect hours of exploration and very quality narrative.",73.5
"mankinds greatest achievement, at least until elder scrolls vi comes out.",594.9
"skyrim is thrilling game, and it is overally balanced out. cheats are nice though.",3.8
"probably the most entertainment ive ever gotten from a fantasy-style game. bethesda always delivers.",318.0

"no intervention or ballista, or any sniper rifles at all infact, so its therefore impossible to quickscope/noscope, therefore the game is 0/10. its simple, if only all reviewers where as forward thinking as me.",0.8
"this game is crack. it will consume your life. you will spend hundreds of hours playing this game and still be coming back for more. easily one of the best, if not the best, game ever made. but buyer beware: your social life will disappear once you start playing this game.",24.9
"sweetrolls arrows in knees dragons mods dungeons dlc 10/10 would bang 16/10 would play again best game 5ever - ign",74.0

"if you havnt heard of this game i dont know what youve been doing with your life. its great, one of my personal favorites. the world is huge, and there is so much to explore. so many missions and weapons, and a great modding community too!",26.9
"this game is one of the best rpgs i played. when i first played skyrim, the assasin path was just for me. however there is one thing i would improve : the stealth system. it seems that just crouching and sneaking isnt good enough. but i can live past that minor fail :d i would gladly recommend this game for all rpg loving people.",311.0
"as with all elder scrolls games, this one immerses the player in a world of vibrant colors, sounds, and lore. this game is far from perfect, as i play with a large amount of mods to make it more enjoyable, but it does not detract from its brilliance. the story is great, albeit a bit lazy on the finish. the scenery is awe inspiring, sometimes leaving me just to staring off a mountainside at its brilliance. i reccommend this game to anyone who wants to fight dragons, explore ancient ruins, and save the world.",148.7
"skyrim is by far one of my favorite games of all time. the amount of stuff you can do in skyrim is unbelievable. if you do however run out of stuff to do there is an awesome modding community which produces new content every day.",151.8

"who doesnt want to kill dragons and get all the loot :)",18.2
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",71.8
"from the 45 minutes ive played of this game, ive realised that i have been deprived from truly great games. the land of skyrim is like nothing ive experienced before. i cant remeber the last time ive truly felt free in a game. i have always been giving inspiration by beautiful games, but i have never experienced one of this magnitude. when a true gamer hears the term its only a game they just smile and nod. but when the truth of the matter is that these are more than games, they are an artwork. they give inspiration. they give hope. they make you someone else in a far off land. they change the view of our repetitive lives.",68.1

"one of the most epic video games ever made on this mudball we call earth... the game has some bugs , but its rarely story-line breaker.give yourself to the atmosphere of a good old fashioned fantasy rpg with more than 100hours of content (not mentioning dlcs)",50.6
"awesome game. stealth is the best way to go. havent played dlc.",122.1
"just an epic open world game that never seems to end. it will also devour your souls and kill any chance that you had of having a girl friend. but its worth it!!!!",57.7
"a bloody gorgeous game. gameplay could be better. good game, but would probably not pay full price (buy it when it goes on sale - i did)",66.5
"one of the most open rpgs youll ever play. the worst part of the game is the inventory management, which says a lot about the quality of the game. id have to nitpick to find things wrong with it. melee combat can be frustrating at times, and lacks variety, but wielding a 2-handed ax and smashing dragons with it is still incredibly satisfying. theres a ton of quests to do, and very interesting little storylines associated with them, even to the smallest of side quests. overall, its one of the best games ive ever played, and with the open leveling system and amount of content to explore, the replayability is very high.",201.6
"this game is amazing. this game has a lot of activitys to do in the game. skyrim has very little bugs. this is a must buy game",38.6
"i got to have sex with a little bunny after killing it several times and after resurrecting it, and killed it again",184.8
"just recently got the game and it is probaly the most fun ive had in a while i highly recommend this game you get the ingame stuff but then once you have enough fun with the ingame stuff then you move on to the mods and thats where it gets really intresting i love the fact that i can go into creation kit in the tools menu and create weapons to my specs damage you name it the elder scrolls v: skyrim lets you play how you wanna play thats why i give it 10/10",11.9

"i could just say that and leave it but i wont. ok, i know that character creation can be a little tedious but, other than that, i can not complain about this game at all. the graphics are amazing, the dialogue and quests are intreguing, and the whole premice of being a dragonborn is just awsome. the scenary around the massive open world is breathtaking, and the inhabitants are even more so. i would honestly reccomend this game to anyone as i love it all so much! that is pretty much all i can say on this subject... let me guess, somebody stole your sweetroll...",118.6
"its my most played steam game, apparently, and obviously complex in its breadth and complexity. ill try to keep this simple. it gives me what i expected from it: ample exploration, adventure, and avenue for character aggrandizement; thorough customizability through character options as well as thousands of mods; and a deeply detailed world to engage. as an overall game, it strikes a different balance than its two predecessors. i look to enjoy the strong points of each ones balance, though those strong points and balances each be different. the mods really are a crucial thing, though. from bug-fixing and other quality of life to tweaking balance choices i would not have made to bringing in the idea that i will find yet more things to reenergize the experience, they remain an integral part of my tes experience. ill tell you one other thing: i personally have spent way, way, way less time struggling to just get the game to {keep working, stop crashing, stop obviously bugging out}, and i do appreciate that contrast to its siblings.",626.9
"easily the best bethesda game made yet, very solid and massive rpg. its about the same size as morrowind but because of the mountanious terrain it takes 3x as long to get anywhere. random dragon battle are one of the best parts of the game. few bugs for a beshesda game starting out i was impressed.",88.2

"what can i say, is a wonderful game. then with the dlc makes this game, even better today! i also know that at the beginning of 2013 will be released another expansion called dragonborn. so for lovers of skyrim, prepared to sharpen your knives! 10/10.",239.5
"a must buy for any gamers who loves adventure. for those who like a bit of challenge, this game is merciless if set in legendary difficulty. my favorite part of this game though is the modding, gives the game a lot more content and improves some mechanics. piece of advice: if you are an achievement hunter, finish the game without the mods. i had to restart/reinstall the game because of some broken mods. even without the mods, i would have still enjoyed it nonetheless.",178.7
"this game is a masterpiece. one of my favourite games. so much depth and gameplay. it even has some great characters and music. the only thing i could say needs improving is more voice actors for variety of npcs. other than that, awesome game.",602.6
"hands down this is my favorite adventure/rpg ive ever played. being highly customizable with community mods is what keeps me coming back to this gem. the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is top notch. just like when purchasing a car, i judge games i play on how they feel. when i play this game, i can get lost in its world for hours at a time. while the gameworld itself has vast depth, the story itself is lackluster. bethesda has a habit of making interesting and deep worlds, but shallow characters and storylines. if they could master how to make characters feel real and like your character is part of an unfolding story, rather than the centerpiece by which the world revolves around, i would probably quit my job and play their games without eating, drinking, and/or defacating. myself and my couch would become one and together we would rule tamriel together.",558.9
"great game, super immersive. i cant add much to the conversation regarding how awesome this game is.",126.2

"this game is unbelievably amazing. i absolutely love it so much. best rpg game out in stores. if youre into rpg games, this is it for you.",32.7
"what can i say that hasnt already been said about this game? just piling on the kudos for a very open game world which you can mod to be even more awesome. the base game is very fun to play and though the combat can be a bit clunky sometimes, you can sink hours and hours into this game. i usually play offline so it doesnt have my total hours here correctly, but ive sunk over 300 hours into this game. and the mods! check out the flora mods, the hi-res mods, difficulties, all either lore inspired or just way out there. awesome game and extremely highly recommended. i still get sucked into playing this game for hours after taking a few months break on it.",66.0
"this game is excellent, its so addicting. the gameplay is pretty much endless, and the huge world you can explore is just awesome. a bad part about it is, it needs really good graphics, or else its really slow and is frustrating to play. so if you have a good graphics card, i strongly suggest you buy it.",11.7
"bethesda amazes me again with this game of awesomeness.",319.8
"i loved the game... until the moment it stoped working",147.4
"best current singleplayer game in the elder scrolls franchise. great story line id say, with multiple side quests to do along the way. when you beat the main storyline, the game doesnt end. you can do the 32+ side quests, with each breaking off into different tasks. at almost any point in the game, you can go dungeon raiding or treasure hunting. join different factions to get more side quests. buy the dlcs, and you get even more side quests and exclusive items. if you havent had enough after all of that, go on down to the steam workshop to download mods and addons. one click of a button, and the mod is automatically installed! or, if you want, create your own mods. mods can also be found on the skyrim nexus, however they have to be installed manually. all in all, the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazing game that even has its own hd texture pack. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves open-world games set in a medieval nordic country. (and dont forget about the dragons!) : )",69.3
"for anyone that didnt already know: this game is awesome! the graphics, the story, the enormous world, the myriad places to loot & visit, the quests... and then i didnt even speak of the renewed skill system, which, after getting a little used to, is quite better than the one in oblivion, imho!",179.2
"one of the best games ive ever played. back when i was a mere console pesant i had over a hundred hours clocked into this masterpiece. but now that i see this game on pc im never going back. from the beautiful views of the moon and mountains to the faciel expressions of the people in the cities. smithing and potion making has never been this great in any other game i have played in the past as well as the different perks that come with the races. all in all, i would recoment this game to my friends. stay fabulous people, -wordsmith",116.9
"this game only stops being fun once your computer cant handle any more mods... but then you just delete some and start again!!! :d",210.7
"i love the face bashing bloodiness of killing things",453.0
"this game has lots of swords. 10/10 would play again",833.9
"in my opinion, i believe skyrim to be the best elder scrolls game bethesda has made. it has the best ever graphics ive seen. its the neverending game, due to the workshop and the tortureable kids.",477.7
"after umming and arhhing about a thumbs up or a thumbs down, honesty got the better of me. yes, the graphics are a delight, but the gameplay is a sticky mud pie, the combat awkward and unresponsive to input controls, there are way too many mini-quests where you have to go out and slay beast or animal and then report back, wasting so much game time on irrelevancies, and the game totally failed on the replay stakes. ive been trying to go through it again, having learnt from the mishaps of the first run, but it is not holding my interest -- quite the opposite. if you just want to roam an endless landscape in awe of the graphic artists, then this is ideal. if you want a play a game at the same time, leave it alone.",77.3
"skyrim is not just a game, its a whole world in your hands! the story is just crazy, side quests are great! you can become a great warrior, or be a regular family man, the choice is yours, but know the world of skyrim is great friend of mine and he is waiting for you!",96.5

"this game has something for everyone. i am not one for first person shooter games but skyrim has more than just killing. there is a whole world to explore and become who you want. feel like becoming a mage? want to be a hired hitman? want to just run around the world meeting people? just feel like exploring? want to get married? i fully reccommend this game! (also, i have over 40 hours on this game but i guess my offline time doesnt add to my profile?)",102.4

"its the beast sandbox/rpg ever made if you dont have this there may be a sniper out side",82.2

"ok, skyrim is the greatest game that i have ever bought. it is extremely addictive because of how huge the world is and how amazing the gameplay is. this game is not that laggy at all and the actual gameplay is great, i love the combat (especially sneaking). the wide variety of creatures that you can battle also makes this game great. some of this game is realistic (apart from the dungeons and dragons type of stuff). thankyou for taking your time to read this and happy gaming ;p",193.6

"killed a dragon. made a hat out of its corpse. ten outta ten.",111.0
"its been a long time since i played any of the elder scrolls games and now i own three of the five that are out including the dlc. i really like these games, yes there is a set story line but its more like a choose your own adventure novel when playing. if you like adventure rpgs then these games and this game is for you .",339.5
"first off, i will admit that skyrim is the first elder scrolls game that ive ever played and until now i did not know what i was missing. i first received skyrim as an xmas gift from my fiance for the xbox in 2011. i loved it so much that when i moved to pc gaming, it was a must have game for me. anyways, on to the review: this game has amazing graphics and goes indepth with how you want to play. becoming a werewolf or a vampire have their own perks as well. persuasion, intimidation, assassination, head-to-head combat, poison.. attack the situation how you want to. the story can be a little hard to swallow in some spots, but i actually dont play this game for the story. i love just wandering around and killing things. if you choose to do what i did and bumrush through the main story just to see what happens, it should still take a decent amount of time. ive been playing this game for two years and havent even touched the civil war that you can choose a side in. not to mention the hundreds of side quests this game has to offer. all in all. this is an awesome game. if youre not playing it yet, get it!",18.1
"thoroughly enjoyed the game. it has a brilliant open world experience and i felt free to do whatever i pleased. i highly recommend this as a roleplaying game and open world game to everyone and anyone.",497.6
"this game is the ing . buy this game now, or i will come to your house and kill you.",181.9
"one of the best rpgs i ever played and probably even will play. though gameplay progressed only a little bit from the elder scrolls iii: morrowind and graphics requirement may be a little bit too much, its still one of the most sophisticated, gorgerous and surprising games out there. conclusion: a true epos about brave men, beautiful women and legends about dragons, f#%* yeah! what else do you need? 5/5",2.7
"love this game its pretty fun and different i like being able to choose my character and have all the stats",48.5
"execellent game that will give you an endless amount of adventure and questing, and the fun continues into the world of modding!",78.0
"i love this game becuase of its graphaics ,jk not really its a great game more when it gets glitchy and weird things happen",5.1
"good game. bit more dumbed down than oblivion, but combat was a lot better. magic was saddening though. i guess thats what mods are for.",45.2
"alot of fun , fun with or without mods,looking forward to the online verson",744.2
"engaging, immersive and massively open world. you wont want to stop playing.",186.8
"i think to i no need to tell a lot about that game. it is a almost most famous game in the world. i have bought that because i am very interesting that story, i mean stories. there are many of stories what seems like cannot be counted. that game can give to you thousand of hours. it is a longest game what i have ever seen. good things: -the developers seems like have made it a complete world. -many of possibility as you will choose in that world. -all your actions have result. bad or good thing as your choose. bad thing: -the world as big what developers couldnt handle. there are some slight bug, glitch. -the graphic is beautiful, but it need a strong computer for you can enjoy it. -that game is story oriented, so this game without story just a simple game. if you dont like the story games or that story, you will feel boring when you play skyrim. i recommend this game to those who have played the before the elders of scroll series and those who like story oriented game.",265.1
"hard to give a recommendation for this game when it pretty much does it itself. i do recommend mods though, sweet sweet mods.",312.0
"this game is literally life, you need this game. you can make naked girls c: (or guys if youre into that stuff im not judgeing c:)",152.7

"ive been playing the elder scrolls for years now and skyrim is by far the best.",47.1
"easily my favorite game of the past 10 years. with the amazing mods and open world dynamics the replay factor is limitless.",260.7
"quite simply the best elder scrolls game yet. bethesda have done a good job of balancing a continuing rich and immersive storyline without treading on the heels of oblivion by setting it far enough in the future that the events of the past game still have influence, but are ultimately left fuzzy so that players fill in the blanks. oh, and its the sexiest game of its kind in terms of the sheer graphics, which upcoming mods will no doubt improve even more",433.1
"one of the best games of all time, hands down. bethesda churns out another epic and exceedingly large tale set in a very open world. with the immense support for modding in the community, skyrim can stand out as one of the most beautiful games imaginable. the modding community itself is a testament to bethesdas greatness, in being so supportive of community content. this support enables new content from the modding community that enhances bethesdas world and offers many improvements and innovations the original vanilla game could not offer. even if the game is played vanilla, without any modifications, it is a beautiful game, full of wonderfully written lore and story.",898.1
"favorite rpg and one of my favorite games of all-time. leveling is fun, good story, combat is ok, and mod support!",54.7
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is critically acclaimed, and for good reason; its a very solid open-world rpg, but is notably simpler and more casual than its predecessor, oblivion (which in turn was more casual than morrowind). however, while skyrim is a good game on its own, installing mods is a must, and with a collection as large as the steam workshop, the game can be modified to look as good as next-gen (as long as your computer can handle it), and the mechanics can be vastly improved or even overhauled. tl;dr: skyrim is good, but skyrim with mods is amazing. play this game if you enjoy fantasy rpgs with large and detailed worlds.",245.3
"what can i say about skyrim? best f#!king game ever made!",137.5
"this is an rpg if you like playing medieval games that involes a lot of fantasy this is for you",87.4
"hullo -- skyrim -- bethesdas masterpiece? some things arent quite perfect, but if youve never played it, youre missing out.",809.9
"its an amazing $60 terrain exploration simulator, and maybe thats not a bad thing after all. you can lose hundreds of hours in the beauty of this world, if not the characters. bethesda produces immensly solid titles that perhaps target the median a little too much, but they do it with a sincerety and devotion that is impossible to ignore. i strongly endorse this game.",88.5
"one of my favourite action rpgs. though the main story line is weak, and only few choices really matter to the world, its still one of the most amazing rpg universes out there with a more realistic spin on tolkiens ideas and a few original races as well. one of the most supported games out there from the modding community, adding so much more to an already huge world. i would almost go as far as to say it must be played with at least some enhancement mods, though, as the graphics lack a certain atmosphere, and dark areas never really seem dark without proper lighting mods installed. ive spent 112 hours (as of writing this) and i still havent covered all the content and all the classes and race combinations yet. if you are an rpg enthusiast, i would most certainly recommend giving this game a go.",127.9
"very large game world and lots of things to do. i didnt like the open-world genre before i played this game. the rpg is great and a lot of customization. one thing that could have made the game better is more auto save. it sucked when i was far didnt save then died.",14.6
"skyrim, where do i begin. this is the best game i have ever played in my entire life. i first purchased this on xbox 360 back when 2011 when it was released and i loved it. on the xbox 360 i have probably played over 2000 hours. i got it on pc for the mods and i still love it. if you want to make a character to be evil, good or better yet act like a jester throughout skyrim. it is completly your choice and thats one of the big features about skyrim. this game brings you back all the time begging you to play it. this game normal (no mods) is just lovely. the graphics are stunning and will blow you away with some of the sceneries. i would highly recommend this game. that why im giving it a 10/10.",127.2

"skyrim is not just a game its a portal to new dimensions and unlimited possibilities, the freedom to wander around an ever changing world, the tools provided for modders and the community, an universe of imagination and dreams, where you play the way you like and make it fit to whatever youre up to. i highly recommend it!",429.3
"a great rpg. the elder scrolls v is, first of all, a huge open world, where you can find everything from robbers of all stripes to the dragons. secondly, an interesting storyline and a lot of additional missions. thirdly, this is a good graphics, and great soundtrack. my opinion 10/10.",180.0

"vanilla version of skyrim is pretty meh after first walkthrough, but with a little help from nexus forums modding community and nmm (nexus mod manager), this is one of the best games ive ever played. i recommend modding, it really makes skyrim completely different gaming experience!",560.9
"very enjoyable and deep gameplay immersion. always something different to do as you can never be bored with this game. they made cheat codes for this game which can counter gliches or just make your character op.",344.1
"i get bored easily in games, and usually their genre is rpg, or tps. but dude, this game! let me tell you this, nothing in this game is boring. just when i start to get bored a dragon appears from nowhere and cheers me up. not to mention random quest givers popup everytime. after 60 hours of gameplay i still have tons of quest in my list and i dont know which one i should choose next :) im not an old school elder scrolls fan, the first game of bethesda i played was fallout 3. i loved the game but couldnt play it, because it made me depressed. instead i watched my friend playing and i had so much fun. but in skyrim i dont have to worry about that. because the atmosphere is too damn cool. just look at that huge mountain or wow that city dude if you still wondering, stop and buy this game. get your coffee at 8 pm, and start playing. :)",59.1
"i really, really love this game, although i have quite a bit of trouble running it on my computer considering how slow it is. i have probably sunk more hours into this game than any game ive ever owned. i will continue to do so. the mods available from the community are quite interesting as well, but i tend to have trouble with getting the load orders right, and end up crashing my game alot. the game has very good mechanics, and beautiful scenery, which can actually be visited as the game is an open world. i sometimes shut out the outside world for weeks, just eating, sleeping and playing skyrim. it is the only reason i still have a windows partition, (yes i am a hypocrite for saying i was completely away from windows.)",146.8
"the long awaited 5th title for the elder scrolls is very much recommended",132.2
"in this game you are a scandinavian with the power to yell quite loud. with this power you will go inside many caves and tombs so that you may harness the power of your yell. when you have seen many caves and become a real estate developer you will be given the ultimate task to kill a volcano. with your yell you must attempt to succeed or else you will fail. this game has many moods and you will find that when you are no longer a scandinavian that has to yell at a volcano, but instead a dolphin flying a spaceship while on the hunt for pirate space sheep that you have found real love.",36.9

"finally killed braith with the help of mods. 11/10 would buy again. but seriously, this game is one of the most immersive games to date. i have lost about four hundred hours to this game, as i first owned this game on the xbox 360. but i had so much fun with it, that i decided to buy it again on pc. not just because the pc version has mods, but because this game is genuinely fun. it was worth every dollar i spent on it.",237.2
"open world dungeons-and-dragons-style adventure game. play in first or third person. make a lizard man that shots lightening out of his finger tips and marry gay cat man. fight dragons that look like the macho man randy savage while dressed as iron man, riding your fluttershy pony. the guitar playing bear sings of your great deeds. if you dont enjoy the idea of hack-n-slash first (or 3rd) person games, then the add-ons (free and seemlessly downloaded directly from steam so so easily) are worth a looky loo. buy it on sale (since its on sale almost every 2 weeks),",675.8

"one of the best open world games ever. has hours of gameplay and hours more if you do the side quests. all its dlc is fun and you should buy the legendary version. its also easily modable and the mods bring more fun to the already fun game plus the mods on external sites like the skyrim nexus brings more easily installed fun, also space core mod cant beat that.",401.1

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a very good game in my opinion. being a person who very much enjoyed the other games in the elder scrolls series i believe this one is another game in the series that adds a lot of great gameplay features and replay value.",740.2
"few games have captivated me like skyrim. there are so many good things to say about it, but i am sure they have already been said. so i will mentiona few of the things that i loved, that are not often praised. first of all, i have put over 200 hours into my ps3 copy of this game, so much of my experience is based on that. i bought the game the day of release, and played for 20 hours non-stop. without even touching the main story line. the thing that drew me in was the absoulte depth of the scenery and the breathtaking beauty it brings. another huge positive of this game is its character upgrade system. many games have simple sliders that you increase whenever you level up, which makes things seem very unimportant. however, skyrim offers a huge skill tree that you can see individual skills that you can choose. finally, i like the the way the inventory is set up. although it was created with consoles in mind, it transfers pretty nicely over to pc (there are mods to make it just a little more mouse friendly). the information is presented in a clear, uncluttered way that really compliments the ambiance that the atmosphere portrays. buy this game, you wont regret it.",4.7
"its 2014, still this is one of the most rewarding games ive ever played. 10/10 theres no reason to not buy this game, unless you cant afford it. if you can buy it. now.",116.4

"i could only take so much of this game. my interest soon turned to boredom, and im sick of watching people play skyrim. dont make me watch any more skyrim! that aside, many people enjoy this game more than i do, and i didnt mind dedicating a sizable chunk of time to this game.",37.9

"with 300 hours of gameplay out of the box and one of the most immersive experiences in an rpg to date, skyrim is the rpg to beat. there is simply nothing quite like the experience through-and-through. an incredible, believable, immersive, deep, engaging, visceral, and just plain fun experience for any would-be veteran lover of fantasy rpgs. heads come off, arrows stick, guard attack, the world changes, and dragons can be victims of your fatalities. fight undead, your brothers, the old lady down the street, or the band of thieves who took residence in that cave you cleared a while back . . . it doesnt matter, youll enjoy yourself the whole way though. quests inspire completion and feel as if they have true meaning within the game; but if you could care less then just run around and forget them. the world can be experienced and enjoyed without so much as tossing a coin to a beggar. the lore is deep enough to provide the world with a soul and breif enough to keep you from losing interest. pick your adventure, aim as best as you can, and try not to steal too many sweetrolls. forget the knee, this game is an arrow to the skull of your desire for the worlds best fantasy role-playing experience (whether pc or console, i recommend using a controller if youre familiar enough).",117.6

"its good but dont overload your skyrim game with mods, if you do it will screw up your data. if you want mods i would suggest picking no less then 4 mods i recommend inigo alot if you like talkitive companions",69.7
"even though i dont play often because im always busy, this game never fails to have me up all night when i should be sleeping. this game was and still is on my top 5 since its release!",138.7
"very, very fun game. pretty intense straight from the start. only downfall is that your companions can can get easily lost. theyll eventually come back if you fast travel, but wont do you good if youre by yourself fighting a dragon. other than that, excellent game and i would recommend it to everyone.",21.0
"its a really good game to spent your time with because its good for those who like adventure",103.4
"this isn;t my first elder scrolls game, but it is the elder scrolls game that hooked me. granted i havent played anything before oblivion (despite really wanting to), i think skyrim is definitely the future of tes games. of course this is just my opinion and i know just about as many people who prefer older versions of tes games as i know people who love skyrim more. either way, the mods make the game better by far and i will never by a bethesda game on a console ever again. 10/10 will always play again :)",81.4

(mage, archer, warrior) 9/10",32.7
"while not quite as good as tes iii: morrowind, this game is lightyears ahead of oblivion. if youve only played oblivion in the past, or are even completely new to the series, this game will blow you away. be prepared for hours of doing whatever the heck you want, because the massive open world is teeming with non-essential dungeons and quests that will leave you in the icy reaches of skyrim searching for that one last thing. there are only a few things that make this game short of perfect, and to most players, these are but trivial details. this game is worth every cent.",216.6
"one of the worst wrpgs ive played. from the getgo, theres no mouse support, bethesda dont care about pc gamers whatsoever. graphics are one of the worst ive seen; since a very very long time. and now, for the most important category: the gameplay. the gameplay is just simply horrendous; the combat mechanics are awful, almost to the degree of unplayability. theres no feedback when slashing and attacking enemies, slashing enemies is as physical as slashing thin air, which makes it very hard to know if youre actually doing any damage at all. the magic system is probably the worse any game could have, its like a complete after thought. running and other body movements are so stiff, its like something from 2002 or earlier... i honestly find it hard to recommend this game; even at $7.50.. therere much much better rpgs out there for the money; darksouls, witcher 2, darksiders 2, dragon age origins,two worlds 2 and kingdoms of amalur reckoning; are just some to mention!",11.0
"do you have a girlfriend? boyfriend? family, or kids to feed? if you love them, you wont buy this game, cause if you do they wont see your face two weeks straight. all of the sudden that sick time and vacation you saved up over the years? gone. you were planning on using it towards taking a cruise to the caribbean, or perhaps going to china or your favorite country in europe. no, what happened was that you decided to buy skyrim with probably all of the dlc at this point. and now you live inside a hovel not knowing what the outside world looks like, and your employer thinks youre dead. cause thats what skyrim does. you think youre done playing, but youre not. youll come right back, you weak willed . ...its a great game which looks fantastic and has one hell of a soundtrack to it. there is a ton to do, and if you are new to the elder scoll games, just like i was, you will be able to adapt pretty easily. there are plenty of quests to do and a lot to explore. and if you like getting into the lore of your videogames there is a ton of it in the elder scrolls universe. at least, skyrim seems to have a lot anyway. and having access to the many mods for pc is an awesome bonus as well. this game is a time sink though. dont be surprised if you hit over a 100 hours playing this game...or 200 for that matter.",141.4
"gorgeous! wonderful! just perfect!! definitely the game for the year 2011 and one the best games ive ever played. bunch of complex missions, infinite sub missions, a huge and marvellous map to explore, awesome fights, great weapons to upgrade and so on...you must play this game!!",155.4
"hands down one of the most, if not the most, immersive, grand scale, adventure, you can find while playing a video game. and with the many mod add-ons, you can make your game as lifelike or silly as you like - depending on your tastes. certaintly one of the greatest adventure games in gaming history.",198.5
"i have 650 played hours in this gameand id recommend skyrim to anyone who like rpgs, the main game can get a bit boring at times, but there is a lot you can do in this game other then the quest and such. seeing as the game came out in 11/11/11 there is a vast amout of mods to also keep you coming back for more that add things like weapons, arrmor and spells, to how it looks and plays. also see as it has been out for more then 3 years there is not a lot that has not been said about this game. if you have not picked it up yest and you wanted to id say go for it",656.9
"how could someone not love this game? i dont play a lot of video games but i have so many hours logged into this one. it has so much to do, you can never get bored. and although you may get to a point with one character that you dont feel that theres much important things to do, then you create another character and make this one completely different. its a beautiful game and has stolen many hours of my life away from me. buy this game. seriously. its worth every penny.",420.8
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4
"a great rpg experience. improves heavily on the mechanics of oblivion. skyrim provides hundreds of hours of gameplay and builds apon its predeceer (tes:oblivion) graphical fidelity is sadly not the greatest in skyrim but mods and enbs are available to add to the experience. but the game makes up for this with lush landscapes and mightly mountians to explore. the environments range from snowy mountians to the sunny town of riverrun to the towering capital solitudes blue palace. outdoors environments help build the epic atmosphere of skyrim with wildlife and bandits. but best of all. dragons. fighting dragons is the pinnacle experience of the game as they approach from the sky you will have to use shouts. as the dragonborn, you can use these shouts to cast a dragon from the sky to the ground, breath fire and even freeze time. as the dragonborn your primary quest will be to save the world from the almighty dragon alduin. but not just that, you can pursuit many more quests, you can just the dark brotherhood, become a mage, join the companions and even become a bard! skyrim is a world so engrossing that its flaws are more than made up for with its impressive open world, immersive character development and amount of incredible content. i recommend this game to everyone, skyrim truly is an epic experience!",278.1
"this is the coolest game for rpg fans i must say. its really hard to find a mistake. the graphics is beautiful the main story is very smart and original. and when i watch the progress. daggerfall, arena, morrowind, oblivion and skyrim! i just cant wait for the next game. because its better and better every time and if you like rpg.... ....i cant find any better game for you than skyrim. but when i think about it now... ... there is just one little thing that i enjoyed in oblivion more than in skyrim. because the testing hall in skyrim is really boring. and thats all. i cant see anything worse than that. and if you dont like cheats... ... well then its a perfect game for you. i love it. buy it. :-d",368.1
"if you are a fan of the elder scrolls series then you will definitely want to pick up skyrim. this game has a lot to offer in terms of storyline, side quests, exploration and customization. players will be forced to take part in a violent civil war that will split brother against brother and friend against friend. magic, alchemy, enchantments and dragon shouts are all pretty straight forward in terms of mechanics and players new to the series will have very little difficulty getting into the swing of things. the graphics and textures are all absolutely stunning with rivers, mountains, valleys, farms, streams, caves, dungeons and dragons popping out at you everywhere you turn. once again, bethesda has delivered a masterpiece and in doing so, has set the bar extremely high for the elder scrolls series! pros + excellent storyline +player customization +endless exploration +beautiful graphics and landscapes +steam workshop mods cons +dungeons can sometimes feel a bit laggy, even on a high-end pc. +some elements such as alchemy, enchantments and magic feel a bit watered down compared to previous elder scrolls titles. warnings this game is meant to be enjoyed as a single player campaign and offers no multiplayer experience. conclusion i would definitely recommend this game to my friends!",220.0

"this game is awsome to play. no story line you must follow, but plenty to go around. you can play this game in any way that you want. if you want to wander and kill wolfs you can, if you want to play one of the story lines in the game you can. the choises you make can make it so you wont be able to do other things, making this game one youll play for many hrs. i would buy dlcs to. both dawnguard and dragonborn have their own story line, dragonborn even adds to the map and gives you more to wander by and explore. so if you like fantasy and this free style gaming, where many mods and fan made quests can be freely downloaded via the steam workshop, this is you; re buy.",269.9
"ive never played a game quite like skyrim, and i really only hope i do again, lol. its an incredible story and journey with a simply beautiful, immersive world. im not sure what exactly pulled me in, but something about skyrim just creates this bond that when you see a mountain or catch a scent of cool air, it makes you want to be back up in the mountains of skyrim. the imagery and vibe of the game in general is just an amazing feeling, making you wish you could forget everything youve discovered in it just to play it again! i hestitated a long time in getting this game, and id say hey, wait no longer. i have to say, a lot of the glitches and such can be aggrivating, but such is a common problem in video games etc. not to mention with the ever-growing mod community, skyrim gets better with time. getting close to 400 hours logged, and many more to come, im sure!",407.9

"this game is huge... maybe even too huge for its own good. even after 300 hours of gameplay there are things you dont know about and will surprise you. but sadly by that time you will feel a bit bored with combat and some other repeating things. no worries though. with workshop and all the mods you can make skyrim 10 times better game. if thats even possible because it already is an ultimate game cosidered to be one of the best of all time.",12.9

"i owned this game on the ps3, but it was stolen. i didnt pick it up until the fall sale and i really made a mistake waiting as long as i did. i didnt play the game for at least a year and i was sucked back into the beautiful world that only elder scrolls can do. the map is absolutely gigantic. the combat in the game is great, but doesnt match the difficulty of morrowind. thats okay for me because you do run into some challenges. the quests are great. i find it difficult to follow the main story because there is so much other stuff to do. overall the game is absolutely amazing and would recommend it to anyone!",96.2

"like a few other people, i honestly thought elder scrolls were crap. the things id seen didnt look good, so i formed an opinion prior to playing the game. thankfully, im happy to report that after buying oblivion, the game prior to skyrim, i was proved so incredibly wrong. the games have so much to offer that theyre damn near perfect. the odd thing i wish would be different, but those things are minor, that the pros vastly outweigh any con i could come up with, and with the modding community, any con i could come up with is being solved, bringing it closer to the absolute perfect game. while my playtime isnt high on steam, i do also own skyrim for the 360... and ive logged probably a good 500 hours or so there playing through everything. and even though ive played through everything, it just doesnt get old. you can play and reply this game countless times, lose hours, days, weeks and months exploring this beautiful world. and if you have the expansions, it gives you even more places to explore. i cannot rate this game highly enough, and i would recommend it to absolutely anyone who loves rpg games. if you dont want to read all that above... simply put, this is a must have title for any fan of rpg games.",214.1

"i highly recommend geting this game because it lets you make your character and make your adventure, its not like one of those game where your forced to play as a certain character and play the same story over and over, its lets you do what ever you want to do with no rush.",176.1
"this game, eventhough it has a few glitches, is an almost perfect game, i say almost because the length of the main story isnt that long, but the amount of side quests and all the things you can become involved in is pretty numerous. the graphics are outstanding, the music is amazin which adds to the epicness of the game. you will never play a game made before this that has a more interactive combat system. because of the creation kit, players can create homes, towns, dungeons, quests, weapons, armor, accesories, alter crafting, even change the overall look of the game world itself. worth every penny.",66.1

"elder scrolls have always been some of the greatest open world rpgs created. this time around you head far north into the mountains and the region of skyrim. there are a lot of blurred lines and you have to decide which factions you are wanting to join as some of them can be at war with each other. the guilds arnt as shiny and easy to recognise as they were in oblivion. skyrim has its equivalents each with their own storyline. the dark brotherhood for example isnt quirky like in oblivion, its just plain evil and you do get a tie in to oblivion and the events of the guild in that game. grab skyrim, most the major bugs have now been fixed and bethesda have upped the ram usage to 4gb. this is bethesda on top form.",83.3

"elder scrolls skyrim is what you expect it to be. it offers you everything you can ever imagine in the form of mods. the game becomes endless upon using said mods. and i will have to say, out of all games i have played, i have invested most of my time playing this game. it isnt difficult to play but offers an rpg experinece like no other. people may say it is a dumbed down version of the older elder scrolls and i will agree with them it totally is. but people have to understand it was made for the consoles first so it had to be dumbed down. and if you can look past the flaws skyrim has (like any other betehsda game), you will find yourself playing the game nonstop and even if you try to quit, youll end up finding yourself back on it >_<",780.2

"as i write this, only 117 hrs on record. one of the most entertaining of the elder scrolls series as far as exploring and finding new things at every turn. i still miss daggerfall (they need to bring back ships, improve spell creation, etc.) and it feels like skyrim has fewer things to loot than oblivion... but with the right mods this game is superb. id say this makes my top 10 list but with a few crippling bugs and with some need for improvement on the crafting/skill/balance area, it will stay toward the bottom of that list for now.",139.8

"as most people already know, this game is amazing. the vast amount of content is unbelievable. i have put in over 100 hours, and feel like i am only half way through. as much as i like this game, i want to point the issues that i have faced. - this game is not optimized for quad core processors. my rig can run most new games on max settings at a smooth framerate. skyrim pushes my system to its limits. even at medium settings, i experience hiccups and frame drops. - there is a large amount of loading in this game. whenever you fast travel or enter/exit a city, you must endure a lengthy load screen. although the screens are pretty, it gets annoying. i do not have a ssd, if you do, this may not be as much of an issue. despite these two annoyances, i highly recommend this game. this game is a steal at $20 and if you get it on sale, you should be put in cuffs.",125.5
"with all dlc and patches, still very buggy. bethesda abandons its faithful and non-modding players to the realm of issues. all they had to do was borrow from the public. this game could still use better leveling and more creatures. they feel very spaced, rather than dwelling in certain parts. i emailed them once, trying to get an idea incorporated. they did incorporate my idea into skyrim, but i never even recieved an email back. they have zero customer loyalty.",145.8

"the glitches are terrible. game might be great if it didnt fail every few minutes. complete system crashes every few minutes during portions of the game. needs serious crash fixing issues. other than not working, it looks like it has potential. upon further troubleshooting, nothing has changed. still crashes, have wasted hours of help forums, nothing works, sent bethesda e-mails, no responses. buy skyrim, or beat yourself with a whip, both similarly painful. why would i waste my time? i liked oblivion, and this looks to be better... but crash crash crash. reboot, reboot, reboot. works smooth just long enough to think things are working and bam - seized up and time to reboot. folks talk about mods. who can play long enough to even know what they are? zero mods, a pc that does great on other newer games, and no-workie (that is a technical term for you noobs).",227.1
"fantastic, just like the rest of the elder scrolls games!",139.5
"a game made for exploring. a very large world that will take a ridiculous amount of time to see, especially if you include the dlc. the combat is pretty decent, and the questing is great. if you like lore, theres tons of books you can collect. if not, just go kill things! join various guilds and other groups as you travel through skyrim. one thing you should do in this game is save often! if you dont you will almost certainly regret it when you go on a grand adventure, kill all the things and get all the loot, and then die or get stuck in a glitch. be a shining hero, or the kind of person people are afraid of the moment they see you. the game has got a pretty good skill tree. i personally enjoy investing in stealthy areas. doesnt get much cooler than being a shadowy kahjiit. over all, it is a pretty good game, and the modding community is massive and active. warning: has been known to destroy peoples social lives.",60.0
"a great game that create the community, or is it the great community that make the game great? maybe it goes both ways. a digital toy box which you can play with it in many many ways. get creative, productive or other -tives with it. cannot recommend this enough. so...",105.4

"awesome game with nice graphics, the gameplay is amazing. even though bethesda has got a reputation of releasing buggy and glitchy games, there are no real gamebreaking bugs. the two dlcs are amazing and the combat and magic system have seen a great improvement from the elder scrolls iv: oblivion. and the leveling system is also very well thought out. there are only some complaints that arent even worth mentioning, exept that the ai can be really bad sometimes. the heartfire dlc gives you the oppertunity to built a house and have childeren. while dawnguard dlc and the dragonborn dlc give you new locations and 2 brand new storylines with both amazing and fun quests. worth the money and you will play this for hours of time. 10/10!",504.2
"10/10, game of the year. i dont care which year. all of them. this game is by far, without a doubt, my favourite game of all time. its immersion is unmatched, the story is amazing, the graphics on pc are absolutely stunning. its one of the most actively modded games around if not the single most modded. if youre thinking about buying it, do it now, you wont regret it. its so cheap for what you get in return. best game ive ever played. wish i had bought it before, but from 11/11/11 until the recent sale, ive played it for thousands of hours...outside of steam.",239.9
"the base version of this game was amazing. it had the looks, a great story, tons of items, lots to do but then you start adding mods and it becomes legendary. if you dont own this game idk why, either you are a pleb or you hate rts games. buy it now!!!",177.7
"the games graphics are okay but with the high res dlc its pretty good graphics. the music for the game is pretty well dont at times but it can repeat alot but that is good if you really like the song. replayibilty its kinda low unless you get dlc or you get mods for it then you can play it for hours. so i would totally recommend this if you are a fan of the elder scrolls games.",218.0
"even though this game is seven years old now, skyrim is still my all-time favorite rpg adventure. what it lacks in default graphics it makes up for in mods and overhauls produced by the gaming community, making your skyrim equal (if not better) to most games on the market today. as far as content goes, if youve finished every quest, explored every cave, and cleared every dungeon, then there are plenty of fantastic quest mods out there and i doubt ill get bored of skyrim any time soon. be sure to check out the skyrim nexus for the latest and greatest mods to keep your game looking fresh. sorry for the rant.",166.3

"apart from all the hype this game receives, it is not that interesting. the story is not captivating, the combat is bland, and there is far to much traveling. as a person who loves shooters, games that focus on sword play leave a lot to be desired.",3.0

"amazing game, like all the elder scrolls series games :)",793.3
"great game. skyrim is beautiful and vast. exploration and dungeon crawling and figthing is very fun. the story is pretty basic, and its a lot better than the doorknob level of complexity of oblivion but it still doesnt live up to the awesome sauce of morrowind. the ui has been gimped to accomodate gamepad console gamers too, so thats very dissapointing. having said all that, its still a blast to play and i sunk about 140 hours into it (without any dlc).",159.8
"the scenery is breathtaking as well as the ability to go wherever you want the quests are optional with lots to do. you could go in to bloody battle, or pretend to be a normal person in one of the cities or towns. overall, it is one of the best fantasy games i have ever seen!",468.0
"its like a hiking simulator, with dragons, monsters, swords and magic.",96.9
"the first elder scrolls game i ever played was morrowind for pc, over the years ive played the subsequent releases on both pc and xbox 360. i think that these games are pretty much the best value video games or entertainment you can buy. the level of detail that goes into each is staggering, thinking about how much time and effort that goes into each new game is incredible. skyrim raises the bar and the sheer wow factor again with detailed lore, graphics, and tight gameplay. the feeling i got playing morrowind all those years ago returned the first time i played this, every turn in the road led to something new to explore. adventures are more fleshed out, and what starts off with one quest, usually ends up turning into a series as you play. this isnt even taking into account the workshop content that can be added by player creations. the one reccomendation i would have for people returning to the series or even thinking of playing this over again. i would say is that you should play it on at least adept setting, really - the harder you set the difficulty the more rewarding each battle can feel. skyrim for me lived up to the crazy hype train that it first rolled in on and more. theres just so much to the game as with most other bethesda games, it would be hard not to like it. skyrim for me is an easy 10/10",101.1

"wow only played for a short little bit and now asking myself why didnt i get this a long time ago. great game.",9.8
"one of my favourite games in my library. this is a game that always captures my attention. not only its graphics is amazing, the gameplay is addicting. this also is one of the few games that is highly moddable yet it wont break it. finishing all the quests is quite hard and tedious though. :p",238.4
"this game is absolutely amazing, not just for what it is, but for how much bethesda left the doors open for modding. playing this on pc is such a different expeience from playing on the ps3 or xbox 360, that it litterally is an entirely different game. every time i find myself beginning to get bored with it, i just look for new and different mods to change it up a bit, and im pulled right back into it again :)",296.5
"one of the best games ive ever played, if not the best",68.0
"if i have 107 hours on record and ive only been able to use 800x600 resolutions and kept all the other settings on the lowest possible level, the game has to be pretty good. 5/5 ebin",153.8
"unmatched combat and landscapes. great storylines. choices have consequences. just look at how many hours ive spent in-game.",299.0
"purely for the sake of it being an elder scrolls game, im recomending this. it can be quite hilarious at times, and sometimes you can get really bored... which is when you can -really- have fun with it. you know, destroying a town, killing its people, leaving no one but the jarl and his court in tact.. and the children. (go download the mod to open killing on everything...) all in all, this game was good fun, and still is. it can get slightly tedius from time to time, but when youve finally lost all intrest in plaing fair, pull up the console! woo cheats!",115.2

"been out for a while now but i still come back to it! if youre a fan of rpgs and havent played this one yet, pick it up. this game is worth hundreds of hours by itself, and when you add in the massive amount of mods that have been and are being created for this game, skyrim is something you will come back to. definitely worth it the price.",266.2

"at the start of the game i ended getting stripped by a bunch of  bandits then an imperial guard gave me some pants and i fled. by the time i reached a nearby town, i tried cross-breeding a dragon with a rabbit. the rabbit kept leaping out of the dragons  so i just effed the rabbit up doggy style. i saw a man sleeping in his comfy bed, but i had the urge to break into his butt. guards caught me and i was brought into this court full of as bandits. they said told me that thy were gonna allow this violation as long as i were to  inside. that sums my skyrim life story up 10/10 game of the century!!!!",7.0

"i dont have time for finishing mission... just for modding...",102.7
"its a good game, very pretty and ridiculously huge. i have some gripes but ive dumped nearly 100 hrs into the game already, so it would be safe to say that my complaints are minor. in comparison to oblivion, the animations are much better, the combat is more fun, the main quest line is more attractive, and the locations are much more diverse. its definitely still a bethesda game though, for better or for worse.",104.1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played. skyrim is a snowy and unforgiving place that has been struck by war. the imperials and the stormcloaks fight for the land and the freedom of skyrim. then there is you; a prisoner (like in all of the elder scrolls games) captured by the imperials and sentenced to death, and out of all of a sudden a dragon appears and attacks the local town you are in. the rest of the game is all up to you and your decisions.",118.4
"this game, eventhough it has a few glitches, is an almost perfect game, i say almost because the length of the main story isnt that long, but the amount of side quests and all the things you can become involved in is pretty numerous. the graphics are outstanding, the music is amazin which adds to the epicness of the game. you will never play a game made before this that has a more interactive combat system. because of the creation kit, players can create homes, towns, dungeons, quests, weapons, armor, accesories, alter crafting, even change the overall look of the game world itself. worth every penny.",66.1

"one of the greatest games of all time. building on the lore and events from past elder scrolls games, skyrim really takes the gameplay and graphics to the next level. beautiful, fun, expansive, a near endless amount of stuff to do, two main story arcs running simulataneously, morality decisions....pretty much everything you could want from an open world rpg. there are bugs, and you will need to save often, but between the vanilla game, the dlc, and all the crazy mods available, this game will be responsible for your lack of sleep potentially for years to come. i think this has become number three on my list after morrowind and baldurs gate.",19.9
"morrowind>shivering isles>oblivion>skyrim. what can i say i prefer the classics.",74.9
"this game is pure sex ! i fell in love with it the first time i played it 2 years ago. the coolest thing is that you can add mods if you are bored of the base game and youve been playing it for houndreds of hours. but the game is perfect the way it is : it has great graphics long campaign and intriguing storyline also addictive gameplay",111.9

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim was one of the first games i ever bought on xbox 360. even though that xbox is terrible compared to pc, my estimated play time on skyrim is over 1000 hours, and that was without the dlc. i recently bought it on pc during the summer sale 2014 and with the steam workshop mods, its like an entirely different game. i cannot support or suggest this game enough, truly one of the masterpiece games of our time. 100/100",14.0

"talk about bang for your buck. i got skyrim for the ps3 back when it came out and also got all the dlc. i put in 200+ hrs. when i upgraded my pc i got skyrim. i have put in 30+ hrs. with all the money i put in this game i am still very happy!",91.5

"such an amazing game, the one that brought me to pc gaming. my favorite game of all time is definitely worth the buy. i have played this game for hours on pc and even longer on ps3 and still find secrets every now and then. when you buy this game you are guaranteed a great and long experience. one thing i will say is that the main quests have little replayability and some are even lacking but with the use of mods from steams very own workshop or the skyrim nexus you can be sure that there is more to skyrim than just the vanilla game.",221.6

"for all its faults technically speaking (which are very few, and remedied by a reliable pc running windows7 and a nice beefy gpu and set of ram.) this has got to be the best overall game ever on pc imho. my hours played, for a single player game should speak for themselves. i fully plan on playing this through multiple times more with different sets of mods and free addons mod authors offer in the workshop and at the nexus along with the great dlcs bethesda make! even while they make and sell great dlc btw, they still allow the game to be modded, remade, edited and tweaked in all sorts of ways, so at the end of the day, no true pc gamer has any excuse not to love this title!",1366.1
"the appeal of skyrim is its immersive open world that offers countless hours of exploration and questing. compared to older entries, the gameplay has been streamlined for a casual approach. constant micromanagement of attributes and preplanning of skill advancement is a thing of the past and you can just play without the worry of accidentally ending up with a dud character. while skyrim offers arguably the most enjoyable gameplay of the series, it lacks the depth of morrowind and has much weaker questlines than oblivion. the ui is also frustratingly atrocious. thankfully, the thriving mod community can address these fallacies and allows you to literally tailor the game to however you want. skyui and the unofficial patches are addons that everyone should get regardless of how they play.",498.4

"skyrim is like a body of water: it has the surface area of a lake (looks beautiful, expansive open world) with the depth of a puddle (more copy-paste than pats elan notes, not much depth to..... anything.....), but with the fantastic range of mods in both the steam workshjop and on the nexus, that puddle can be excavated to a nice swimming pool (and possibly an oceans surface area.) wait, why am i telling you this? how could you not know about skyrim? do those people still exist?",350.8

"ive wasted 300+ hours of my life on this game and i would do it again, even though i feel like bethesda could add more to the game before releasing it, im still astounded by the sheer beauty and magnificence of this game on a daily basis. it was the decider for my favorite genre and game company and i eagerly await the next release in the elder scrolls series (after eso) im positive that ill be spending at least a couple hundred more hours in game. 1,000,000/10 would buy again.",380.2

"ive put more hours into this game than any other, the breadth of content avaliable thanks to the massive modding comunity is skyrims greatest strength. if you play this game with vanilla settings then it doesnt hold up and you can see that its showing its age, however with a wealth of readly avalibale mods you can create on of the best looking games on the market, tailored exactly to your tastes and if you find any of the mechanics of the game are substandard you can be sure someone has modified it to be to your standards. the game however is plagued by crashes and freezing issues with some of the mods either helping to stop them or causing them in the first place. its a huge issue and a decent debugging tool is noticably absent which makes pinpointing issues a herculean task. with hours of work and following multiple guides you can get a stable and beautiful looking game unmodified this game should get a solid 7/10 a fully modded games will surely get a 9/10 from anyone who is willing to put in all the hours of tweaking",379.3

"this product out of the box is pathetic and virtually unplayable. fortunately there is a mod that makes this game bearable, skyui, unfortumately it does not play well with steam. i have played the elder scrolls series since inception up through oblivion and knights of the nine. skyrim removes all of the good and adds alot that is horrible. in morrowind/oblivion there were no rails and the character moved with ease across your screen, if you could climb it you could go there, on the other hand skyrim has added barriers, free form traveling results in the dreaded invisible barrier blocking your passage. combat is unbalanced at best, tons of bugs and glitches to circumvent though, quite challenging.",36.6

"what can i say about skyrim that hasnt already been said? if you own a pc and like video games you need to play skyrim, its just that simple. skyrim (and the previous elder scrolls games) are a large part of video gaming history. they created and perfected multiple genres of gaming that we see in many triple-a titles today. to be honest, if you consider yourself an intelligent gamer, you just dont know games unless you have played one of the elder scrolls titles. skyrim, or its predecessor oblivion, would be on anyones list of all-time best games. the storyline is complex and interesting; the world is huge and immersive; the combat is challenging, varied, and fun; and the amount of hours of fun that you can get out of this game is more than worth the full-price. if all of that wasnt enough, on the pc you can dowload literally hundreds of free mods that can completely change how it plays. you want to be a dragon-man? you can! you want to create your own spells? you can! do yourself a favor and buy this game!",198.8

"skyrim. its an elder scrolls game, which means youre going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game. the combat system, if you want to call it that, is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous elder scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards. however what bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in. dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration. so despite its flaws id strongly recommend this game. there is however a lot of snow. you probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow.",663.9
"do you know those times where you are so mad with the world that you just want to shout? well, this game is perfect for that. yeah, its kinda boring that you need to kill dragons and go into dungeons to find the words to show but, after that, you can scream all you want. some screams make people run away from you, others make you push them and so on. until i bought skyrim, i had no idea how much fun it was to shout but now i do. thanks, skyrim",38.7

"its massive. vanilla story alone will take you 100+ hours to complete, not to mention dlcs. the good: the mechanics are solid, the gameplay is smooth, the scenery is gorgeous, and mods make it even better. the bad: the magic leaves a lot to be desired, its clunky, the menus are primitive, and you can spend more time scrolling then you do shooting. (mods recommended to alleviate this) the ugly: it seems that a team of maybe 20 total voice actors voiced about 1500 people in the game, im used to some overlap, but hearing the same guys voice (not disguised or changed in any way) on three different people in the same town of 20 people is a little annoying. conclusion: annoyances aside, its an incredible game with a rich story and the mods will produce more content then youll ever be able to play in your lifetime. this game will eat your life, and you will love it.",194.7

"i love the exploration in this game, but bethesda just doesnt seem to invest enough time in their games. the biggest lack is the poor npc interaction, too many fetch quests, lack of impact of your actions on the world, and especially your overpoweredness after a while. especially when they want to make a realistic fantasy enviroment, please dont make the character so overpowered, and the hp of the ennemies is just over the top high. bashing ten thousand times at an ennemy is really annoying, and especially the outdated meele system should be improved. the player just doesnt seem to be involved in the world too much. the game is just spamming stuff whitout actually making it really good. sure it has nice graphics, great world, a good leveling up system and such, and i really think this game is very good, but it could be so much better wit one more year of development.",77.3

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"best game ever played, extremely addictive, lots of content. dlc is well worth it. 10/10",103.3
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is another great addition to the serie. it is everything a fan would expect. the story is incredible, the lenght of the game is awesome, you have plenty side-missions and you are left with a lot of different ways to play the game. the 2 main problems why this game doesnt deserve a 10 are the fact that the graphics are way out-dated, they look just like oblivion. it sucks that games nowadays are stuck having to develop with 5yo consoles. i think they shouldve done what bf3 did which is make the game on pc with ultra graphs possibilities and release an xbox/ps3 version which can run only at medium graphs. the second thing is the skill tree really isnt computer friendly, we can clearly see that it was made for console and it sucks. of course theres also a few minor bugs, but nothing that will ruin your gaming experience. overall this is a must buy for any rpg fans and even for people who never played any elder scrolls!",18.7
"the fifth game in the elder scrolls series does not disapoint ;-)",514.3
"if youve played previous elder scrolls games, glitches and oddities dont come as a surprise. nevertheless, skyrim feature tighter combat, fewer bugs, improved graphics and so on. if there is anything to complain about in this game, it would be the user interface, inventory taking up a lot of useless items, some bad acting, as you level up, the creatures you fight take forever to kill by hitting them 30-40 times, and finally its replayability value. creating characters is nice (even though it takes a very long time to get what you want done). finding and completing quests is solid. i said all i disliked. the game succeeds in comparison to elder scrolls iv, and i am addicted to this game like a... person... playing games! replayability value is hard to get back to though if you leave the game for a month or more. anyways, great work on the game, this is more than i expected it to be with little to no struggle to get used to. postives: +tons of content +fun combat +huge open world to explore +modding tools +deep character creation tools +a lot of side missions and long/endless gameplay +a lot of ways to improve graphics negatives: bug-free horrible voice acting poor character animations overall: 9/10",150.2
"what is there to say, other than that this is one of the greatest games of this genre and potentially the best game of the year? learning from the formulas of their previous elder scrolls games (as well as from fallout 3), bethesda has put together the pinnacle of the open world exploration/fantasy game. whether you desire to do battle with dragons, conquor lands in the name of an empire, seek out treasure in ruins or just simple wanderlust, the overwhelming amount of options available to you in terms of how to play and what there is to do and see is staggering. absolutely phenomenal. everyone has to play this game.",205.1

"despite some crazy bugs, this is probably one of the best games ive ever played. it has a huge in-game world, tons of stuff to do and see, and great soundtrack. as someone who has played, and disliked, previous elder scrolls games, i cant recommend this enough.",157.2
"my prelimenary opinion would be that this game is even more awesome than the ones that came before. i was a big gamer when it came to oblivion and i do miss some of the pleasant features of that game in the skyrim gameplay. luckely, in my opinion, the conversationwheel was parted with. a big plus for skyrim is the smithing-feature as are the dragons obviously and the medieval, scandinavian, mythological feeling in-game. regarding to the use of magic, i think it was a great move on the part of the developpers to go with these shouts...very well done. each factions, race, etc. is now even more diverse than in previous games. a big point of critique is that bethesda still has a lot men and women in the game talking in the same voice (but of course it is obvious as to why that is so). the vanilla world map could use some improvement, if you are against using mods for this. as a big fan over the series, i think a 9 out of 10 (with oblivion being 8,5 and morrowind a 7) is an appropriate mark for the elder scrolls v skyrim.",79.3
"skyrim is one of those games that you can sink many hours into. the vanilla game provides ample adventure for you to partake in, while the continually growing community mods (found on the steam workshop, nexus, etc) adds additional options. the graphics may originally be somewhat bland in areas, but can be easily upgraded with user-created mods that enhance textures greatly (as long as your pc can handle) definitely a good buy, especially during the current sale ($17 for the legendary edition)",420.2
"the only reason i can really recommend this game is because the modding community is the only community still holding this game together, apart from the dlc this game isnt too interesting at its core. as to whether its rushed, or just generally lazily designed i wouldnt honestly know. its functional; has its fair share of bugs and glitches, but is still playable right to the end. personally i dont like elder scroll games, but thanks to the modding community this game actually becomes somewhat enjoyable. so download nexus mod manager and turn a solid 5/10 game, into around a 7-8/10! thank you nexus mod manager for making games playable again! :)",75.9
"the world is epic and combat is pretty good. a game worth picking up.",399.1
"step 1 - buy the game step 2 - mod the game until someone comes to your room and asks you what movie is this? the campaign is short but a great one. you have to save the world from the dragons who are led by alduin, the most evil dragon....basically that is all there is when it comes to the campaign. but apart from that there is a story you create on your own with a rich and detailed open world to explore and million other cool side missions to do. this game doesnt hold your hand at all, you can approach the game in anyway you want by becoming a thief, a vampire, a werewolf etc etc you can also join different groups like the dark brotherhood for example, you can join the empire and become an imperial or join the stormcloak rebels to free skyrim from the empire influence. crafting, smithing, enchanting, marriage, adoption, purchase a house, learning spells, cooking etc, this game has so much to offer it will literally consume you. astonishing graphics (especially with mods), amazing soundtracks and endless quests. this game is a masterpiece! worth every penny! personal rating: 10/10 greatest open world rpg of all times",70.7
"i never uninstall skyrim. i come back and play it over and over again because its amazing game with vast amounts of replayability. a huge world and if you ever get tired of what the game offers. the number of mods are countless. anyone can find a lot to like in this game.",372.2
"what can you say about a game like skyrim, well first thing you can say is that its awesome, the second thing you can say is that while it does have plenty of bugs they arent game breaking for the most part, i completely support this game and reccomend people who have and have not played the previous titles to give it a go",91.6
"best video game money ever spent, bethesda dear gosh pump out another elder scroll or fall out that is not mmo.",249.2

"every five years or so a new elder scrolls game comes out, it reminds me ive gotten older...then again, every time a new elder scrolls game comes out, i feel like a kid on christmas eve :p",178.2
"without a doubt one of the best games i have ever played",27.8
"9.7/10 truly amazing game with no limits. skyrim is fun, but the combat is boring. it is very rmb, hold lmb, rmb. i know many will disagree but it basically always come back to that. the story is very good, the graphics are great, the characters are memerable, and the games replay value is through the roof. in the end the game is worth every penny.",284.3
"its pretty good. well, until you start modding heavily and your wife comes home to you constantly crouching on top of a pile of dead naked women with zzz .",67.4
"i have put in over 500hrs into this game, some of it on the 360 where i originally purchased and played the game. i can honestly say modding this game on the pc has made this game priceless and endless. i cant even imagine the amount of hours it would require to complete everything, through multiple play through. compelling story, beautiful graphics and lore. dragon animations are very well done, i remember being shocked at how well they were done. definitely worth your time and money, and the expansions add a lot of extra playtime. i havent even purchased dragonborn, but it is high on my list.",392.6
"i really like this game, the graphics, the quest line en all the other things are just perfect. for me, its the best game of my whole life.",295.7
"mojangs skyrim is the best in the series. thanks notch, for all you do,",84.5
"besides bf3, what i paid for skyrim is not enough, well worth the money and hours of gameplay value! do it!!",123.9
"highly recommend. harder the higher you go on settings. tons of stuff to kill, random events, and things to do [not all violent and some even mind teasers]. love the game it is in my top 10 games to play.",167.4
"got this because i wanted game similar to fallout and it is not as good for me as i like guns not magic i also like a good headshot. but without these biasis its a really good game especialy for someone more into that medival magic type games.",195.2
"ive never been a fan of the bucolic. i much prefer the man-made harshness of concrete and neon to the pastoral settings the fantasy genre has chained itself to. skyrim manages to enchant me though. packed with abandoned locales and small villages, i felt more like a tourist than a warrior. lakes, caves, and snow-covered mountaintops are repositories of mysteries that i couldnt help but dig through.",243.0
"i think this is the best game ever because i have played the other elderscrolls as a kid and i think they are going to be gods because they made me happy as a child i really like how they made the game super easy for people who dont enjoy sitting there and roleplaying as if the game isnt covered in cheats. but i like to sit my  down and restrain myself from shortcuts because i am a goob person in my own eyes and like to slowly grind my way up that and its made by bethesda omg swagalaicious company 10/10 would bang",274.0
"one of the best games i have ever played! i first played skyrim on xbox and i have around 120+ hours on that and i just recently got it for p.c and it is like playing a whole new game. one of the greatest features about playing skyrim on p.c is all the mods! its a refrshing experience and adds a lot more to the game. but this game isnt all about mods, this game has hundreds of hours of gameplay.",66.9
"this game is still awesome, but it is still also crashy. just boring things like alt-tabbing can kill it.",175.5

"this game is probably the best rpg ive ever played. definatly recommend this game to anyone",974.5
"beautiful game. they changed a lot of what made an elder scrolls game and elder scrolls game. and the game is riddled with bugs. still a ing blast to play.",717.7
"a great improvement over previous elder scrolls games. the faces werent creepy ( just a bit squareish ;p but thanks to the modding community that we can rule it out now ), and the dungeons felt suitably different. the enormous world has a lot of fun things no matter where you start looking, and the level system makes it possible to build a large variety of characters without the risk of making an inept character that existed in previous games. there are a large number of points in the game where the player is forced into a single course of action, or an event is triggered regardless of how you attempt to avoid it. this was annoying, but did not prevent me from enjoying the game :)",369.3
"elder scrolls v skyrim is one of the greatest games ever made. amazing graphics, mechanics, story, game play. i have nothing bad to say about this game.",66.7
"ever wanted to become an adventurer? ever dreamt of feeling snowy winds blowing at your face while riding on the way to a fierce battle against a dreadful, fire breathing flying dragon? to wield mighty weapons, powerful magic or even both against your foes? then, my friend, this is the game for you. be warned though, for an arrow taken at the wrong place may end your adventuring days...",0.1

"what can one say about a series like elder scrolls. yes it has plenty of frustations but in the end it is an amazing game of our generation and thankfully for pc players there is a legion of modders out there contently making the game more playable every day. highly recommended",660.3
"currently my favorite and most played game, skyrim is a great way to spend time with friends and family or just by yourself. you can go into it not playing any of the other games and still get the concept. from the gameplay to the graphics this is definitly worth your money. with definitly +100 hours of gameplay ready to go. not to mention the dragons are ing badass!",18.4
"what i like about skyrim...what i like about skyrim...if i told you everything, wed be here for awhile. short version all i can say is that if you have yet to buy this game, then you have wasted your money on other games! the elder scolls v: skyrim is perhaps the best game ive ever laid eyes upon! the graphics, the gameplay, the characters, and the potential mods! the story plot could use some work, but reguardless, you will enjoy this game. ive made over 10+ characters playing this game alone and served 600+ hours on this game. i originally bought it for xbox 360, and again on the pc. if you get a little bored, youll always find yourself coming back. there is even a huge modding community dedicated to adding more content to the game for free! why are you still reading this, why arent you playing skyrim! im not just saying this points or anything, i specifically chose this game because everyone should have a copy, i can assure you, the money is well spent playing this game.",1016.3

"very fun game, also very addicting. amazing graphics, and easy set-up. hilarious when it comes to personalities. seems like an actual world/place that someone would live in. i enjoy the way you get to actually make your own character and now play one of those boring old pre-created ones. the amount of detail in this game is astonishing. cant wait for tes: vi",645.0
"really fun and full of glithces that make you laugh. you are completely free to progress how you want, the way you want. the only issue ive got is that its one of those games where if you put it down... you dont pick it back up. fun though. especially when riding up a mounting at a 65 degree angle on a horse.",52.1
"this game is a singleplayer rpg game. its full of dragons,trolls,wolfs etc i would recommend this game it is very time comsuming but worth it you can cast spells and find bows,daggers,swords,battle axes,maces and so much more!",2.9

"having played over 400+ hours on the ps3 and pc, i must say this game is just amazing. i might take a break for a week or two after playing for a couple of days, but the truth is.... i do not get tired of this game, i want to explore more and more, collect all the weapons and armors and all the other stuff, if this game was a girl i would marry it and have babies!!! buy this game",323.5

"i should really give this game a thumbs down and here is why: this game is an insane leech of time, no matter how many games i buy on steam and no matter how much i attempt to beat other games i just keep coming back to this. its causing an inibility to continously play other games once i get started. there are moments in which i am able to escape, and just so as long as i dont load up skyrim i am able to play other games, but then i end up loading it up and cannot stop. this is not just due to the open world, but how moddable the game is, and how much workshop support the game has. damn it skyrim, i was trying to play something else but somehow i find myself in your world again, you know what. screw it, you should get this game.",1151.7
"wanna hack and slash and conquer the world, well you can in this game with the help of mods that make your gameing expeirence amazing! cast spells, make weapons enchant them, improve them, shower your enimies from afar with arrows, or sneak behind them in the shadows and eliminate them with one swift attack, battle bandits, trolls, dwarven contraptions, necromancer all the fantasy enemies and of course your favorite enemy the dragon, out of no where of wings of black, blasting balls of fire, streams of ice, even lightning. with your own path to walk its your choice to become the hero, if not the most feared villian of all time. this is now your world for you are dovahkiin, dragon born!",238.8

"tes v:skyrim used to be my favourite game. however, as i kept playing for hours and hours, over and over, one thing became clear. this game does not deserve to be called an rpg in my opinion. like so many others, this game gives you a few miniscule choices followed by rather boring combat as you progress.i like my rpg choices to actually change the gameplay. in my opinion the major choice is *spoiler* the choice between the grand cyrodiilian based empire or a puny rebellion. other than an initiation, the war goes exactly the same from that choice. i did enjoy the details that the designers put in such as the literature and history but lineal gameplay irks me.",50.9
"the elder scrolls v - skyrim is with no doubt one of the best games recently released. an open-world rpg with an infinite amount of quests and modding support ? count me in. the replayability is also almost endless, because you can make a totally new character with other skills and so have a new experience. installing mods can also help you fighting the boredom when youve reached 300+ hours ingame.",39.9

"amazing game. heaps of classes to choose from and various paths you can choose. whether it be an archer, a cold hearted assassin, or a brave and courageous warrior. skyrim is the game for anyone wanting a true rpg with realistic graaphics and fun gameplay. the main quest is great. while it is short, there are many side quests to do. it takes over 120 hours to finish the entire game. that is truly enormus! the game is open-world, and you have a sense over danger and exctitment rushing through you when you are exploring caves, looting dungeons, and more! skyrim is a fantastic game that anyone can play 9.5/10",1.5

"i put a lot of hours into this game and really enjoy almost all aspects of it, but there are a few i cant work with. archery (i like using bow and arrow, its my favorite playstyle) - is not a viable way to play the game. i tried to play as a ranger and the for example id need to shoot the same target 3-4 times to kill them, where as in magic..they die in like 3 seconds. 3-4 arrows per target, now mind you - that it does not matter if you shoot them in the leg or arm, or chest, it takes generally 3-4 shots to kill a non-shield wearer/non-boss type. by the time youre in the middle of shooting my second arrow, they are already bashing me. ranging does not do enough damage to be viable imo. really disappointed because it was my favorite playstyle.",390.9

"after first 20 hours you will realize this game is excactly the same stuff... just go, explore (same caverns), kill, wow dragon, kill, try to steal something and sell it to a random guy, then repeat all. it can get interesting with some mods, but it can get buggy as well. only if you have a lot of time to waste.otherwhise go for the elder scrolls oblivion.",59.2
"pretty fun i have only played a little so i am not an expert.",209.6
"the single best game ive ever played. its an immersive adventurer which you can be anything you want to be. bethesda gave you the tools to make the game you want with tonnes of mods to enhance the game endlessly and multiple storylines not just the main storyline to complete. i 100% recommend this game it is one of if not the best game ive ever experienced.",92.4

"legendy edition (with all the dlc) is (overall) the best fantasy rpg of all time, and i _love_ fantasy rpgs. the dlc really adds a lot of high-quality content. best played when you have all of the content at the beginning and the whole world just melts together with the dlc and you dont really know what is coming from where.",75.0
"time to recommend, what is probably the most hyped game ive ever played. first of all. its good, thats all you need to really know. it is a good game. but it got some massive flaws. if i am to compare it to morrowind or oblivion, it is worse. in pretty much every way. first time playing morrowind you will notice that it got some of the best music you can come by, and some cool gameplay. oblivion was so good i never stopped playing it, until i had made every mission. this game, skyrim, is a bit of both. only real problem with it - its extremly repetitive. every mission (pretty much) is the other alike. it got some really cool graphics, finally some decent voiceacting and some good missions every now and then. the dragons that were so extremly hyped are a bust tho. they do not live up to their name. they are repetitive and boring. which kinda kills the whole dragonborn-plot so wait for a sale, then buy it. you wont regret it. its good, really good, just not as good as its precursors. so it doesnt get full pot, but almost 9/10",53.9
"skyrim... i dont really think theres much that i can say about this game that hasnt already been said! ive played hundreds of hours on this game (i initially played on console) and ive loved every minute! skyrim is one of those games that just never gets old, you can always come back to it and therell be new stuff to find. and thats just vanilla without mods; the modding community for this game is fantastic, and if you cant find what you want on the steam workshop there are thousands of mods on the skyrim nexus. from things as simple as retextures to make your game beautiful, all the way up to entirely new worlds, there are mods out there that will completely change your experience. and thats what i lovwe about this game, it never plays the same twice! i highly recommend this game to anyone, even if youre not a big rpg fan, this game is still a masterpiece! at such a low price now, this game is an absolute steal!",126.8

"the vanilla game is enjoyable, but i cannot recommend it, as it is nothing compared to the game where you employ mods. for those out there that either fear or detest the lore-breaking aspect of mods, im not asking you to download a school uniform or a xxxxxl bust size for your character. im asking you to look at the effort put in by the community of modders who strive to make the game a more enjoyable experience for all, like skyui or falskaar.",277.6

"skyrim is an amazing, open world, fantasy rpg that i have wasted many hours on at this point. the game is very enjoyable with a decent storyline, numerous side quests, fairly good graphics even by todays standards, and fun gameplay that will have you stuck on your pc for hours on end. compared to other elder scrolls games it is much better than oblivion, but i dont consider it to be as good as morrowind (though that may be just nolstalgia speaking). if you buy this game i highly recommend the use of mods because after your first playthrough, the game may seem boring and repetative. also, the steam workshop make modding this game very easy even if you have never modded a game before. all in all, skyrim is a great game, mods or no mods, and i would highly recommend it to any gamer. without mods: 8.5/10 with mods: 10/10",408.3

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7
"skyrim is a brilliant and epic rpg that is made even better by the fact that the modding community around it is so large and vast. the elder scrolls v: skyrim stands along side its siblings as a grand rpg, skyrim posses a descent enough story with an ample amount of side quests to satiate your appetite. but i believe that the best part of skyrim its self is has a large open world, the beauty of it is just exploring until your hearts content, youll find all sorts of things from dark murky caves to cites full of people and well loot! now to talk about the exiting part of skyrim, mods. this is when you find the true potential of the game, being able to add hours of gameplay to a game that can be improved or just tweaked to how you want it to be; from texture overhauls, to quests and mechanic changes. modding skyrim is a lot of fun and simple (mostly). if you have played any of the other tes games or have never picked one up this is a great place to start, so go forth buy it i promise you wont be disappointed (most likely =p)",542.7

(if you want a complete experience, i also recommend buying the dlcs. they are tons of fun and very cheap if you buy the skyrim legendary edition (at sale).) i hope this was usefull for all of you :)",546.3

"tons of things to do - ive since forgone doing the main quest lines and now have about 50 side quests lined up in my quest menu. ive gone dungeon diving, slayed dragons, destroyed entire bandit camps, and ive only passed through about half of the map so far (at 18 hours). im looking forward to many more hours with the time sink.",48.1
"a true epic... bethesda has done it again with the elder scrolls v. intense action and an amazing story. if you love your mom youll buy this game or ill send chuck norris to your house! i think once you purchase this game youll agree its one of the greatest games ever. play it for glory and honor my friends!",153.1
"this is one of my favorite games of all times. the fact that it is open world is amazing, and the character developement is so much fun! i love the voice acting, and the quests. it keeps you busy for sooooo long! and the best part honestly is all of the silly bugs! skyrim has the best glitches ever. xd",295.7
"when you can see ants on a log, you know its a good game!",16.7
"such an amazing game! where to start? there is so many things to do and such a large map that it takes ages for you to 100% it, the core game play if so much fun wheather your sneaking around to kill a target or just casually storming a town single handedly your bound for a challange or two along the way! though it maight be alittle buggy at times, still worth every penny its something that you can put down and come back to or even play solidly and lose track of time! overall worth it!",63.5
"looking for a good time? start a new character and up the difficulty to legendary. i once spent 2 hours in one area fighting multiple bears and a spriggan matron, with only a conjoured wolf familar to protect me. never before have i felt more alive. 11/10 game of the decade",404.3

"most addicting game ever! i have played older games like oblivion and morrowind but i think skyrim is better than them morrowind: best storyline oblivion: best gameplay skyrim: best graphics",323.4
"skyrim is a very in-depth game, you will spend hundreds of hours questing. the main story is very good, it takes you all over the land of skyrim, and it has many challenging enemies. one thing that you will not be doing is grinding. the game has a leveling system that has nothing to do with how many enemies you have defeated, its all about using all of your skills. no matter which path you take, you will surelyhave an amazing time playing the elder scrolls v: skyrim.",384.7

"ive spent a lot of time in skyrim, i think the thing that keeps bringing me back is the vastness of the world. there are a lot of places to explore and theres tons of lore and interesting stories to find and investigate. whenever i play skyrim, i almost always discover new, and i think thats amazing. unfortunately the wide as the ocean, shallow as a puddle criticism is well-deserved, as a player you rarely feel like youre really changing anything in the world, youre more like a very stabby spectator. i play skyrim on the low graphics setting, and its still beautiful. it does have some issue with texture pop, but i would put that down to my computer not having a very good graphics card. skyrim is obviously extremely well-optimized. controls on pc are well-designed and easily customizable.",434.0

"skyrim, the fifth province in tamriel, and home to the nords of the north, proud and arrogant, have waged war against the empire. when you begin, you are but a prisoner, as usual, but thanks to a set of circumstances (dragon) you are set free to explore this vast and lush land to your leisure, as well as do as you please (though a few activities may land you a bounty) as an open-world game, you gain infinite possibilities, from fighting dragons and mammoth, to crawling around in draugr infested crypts, you fight all manner of enemy, large and small, and get to create your own legend, as you master the thuum and defeat alduin (spoiler alert) personally i havent tried this game with mods, but i will attempt to get some soon. vanilla, this game is easily one of the best i have ever played, would definitely pick this up if you can.",175.5

"i think its rather obvious why you should play this.",476.7
"the best rpg ever made so far. its the top of its class in terms of music, graphics, combat, content, explorability, voice acting, animation, and much more than i can list. bethesda have built this game based on the lessons learned from their previous award winning games. the outcome is that they created a game where the world feels real, combat is dramatic, and the power to choose who you want to be is all yours. this is a masterpiece that you can easily find a sense belonging. skyrim is destined to become game of the year.",539.4
"very heroic, adventurous and exciting! this game is an rpg, adventure where you wonder around, visit temples, enter pubs, shops and all sorts! there is also a wide range of races to chose such as: argonian, breton, dark elf, high elf and much more! brilliant game! 10/10!",95.3
"while i normally play on a console, skyrim on any console is one of the greatest rpg/single player games, in my opinion.",2.2
"in my opinion this game is an awesome rpg with a pretty good story line and lots of open world gameplay and locations to discover with side quests that will keep you occupied and lots of diffrent mods you can download to make the game even better.in the main quest line you play as the dragonborn on your quest to stop the dragons and alduin, the dragon that is bringing the other dragons back to life.and with the dragonborn and dawnguard dlc it adds extra quest lines that that can be longer than the main quest line.so i just think the game is really fun.",84.3

"i went into the game on the back of rave previews which probably overhyped it for me. im a social gamer and i found the skyrim experience lonely and repetitive. its a massive leap forward for open world rpgs for the casual console gamer but coming from a background of mmos where the world is bigger, there are people everywhere to play with and teamwork actually exists... i was disappointed. even as an avid lover of classic rpgs with stories that tug on the heartstrings, i found little to lose myself in with skyrim. id recommend it for those that want to experience gaming as someone new to the medium, or even as a solid experience for an avid gamer. however, if you want something youll be playing for years... try an mmo. if you want a story/experience youll remember for the rest of your life... there are far better alternatives.",66.9

"dont harm the chicken gods... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ this game was one of the first games i ever played. i was in love with the freedom to make my character how i wanted. it was beautifully thought out, and the quests are, for the most part, very fun. i think skyrim is just one of those must-have games. you can waste hundreds of hours hunting down dragons, killing bandits, and stealing books for your bookshelf. pros: huge amount of quests and story branches, allowing virtually endless gameplay mods that improve the game greatly, fixing anything from striping to buggy blacksmiths dlcs that add even more content to the game easy to understand levelling and gameplay cons: the beginning is horrible to sit through, and is altogether sloppy in order to have the highest quality game experience, you must install mods some bugs that have been there for years sometimes hard to follow questlines is the game perfect? no. but honestly, is any?",144.5
"there is literaly nothing i can say that is bad about this game.... the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is fluent and very fun, you never run out of things to do, unlimited custimization, good story, and well.... i could go on for days but to sum it up. i would have gladly payed more than what i did for this game.... if you havent tried it, you need to",61.4
"chances are, if you were interested in skyrim due to it being a sequal to oblivion, you either have it already or passed after seeing how different it is. i, myself, played around 400 hours of oblivion and only really stopped playing it to play skyrim. keeping that in mind, heres what i think. i really liked this game for a long time. after a while, though, the magic of discovery wore off, and i saw underneath what i realized to be the most shallow and bland game the elder scrolls series has to offer. sure, finding all of those dungeons and words of power was a blast, but fighting the enemies while doing so felt more like a chore than anything. even the well animated cinematic kills got old after a while. mods helped a bit with this problem, but overall i would rather the game be more, say, meaty. this was clearly a design descision, and is purely my personal prefrence, but damn did the fun drop off like a rock. should you play skyrim? yeah man, its $20 for ~150 hours of discovery and self-improvement and you can mod the  out of it pretty easily, but dont expect anything revolutionary out of it, like so many elder scrolls fans were.",48.3

"skyrim is one of my favorite games of this generation. oblivion was an amazing game in almost every way, and skrim, the next game in the series, surpasses it. from the very beginning the story puts you right in the middle of an awesome adventure, which you can choose to delve into right then and there, or go off and do your own thing. the interface is slick and easy to use, the level up system is simple but effective, and the skill trees are varied creating many different play styles. i strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes action rpgs or adventure games. so much to do in this game.",40.8
"well, ign already did the mostpart of this for me. this game delivers everything youd want from any game. ever. with stunning graphics and overall complexity, this game delivers an absolutely monumental storyline with endless quests and side missions! bethesda spent so much time dealing with this, and whatever they did, they did it well. with the beautiful resolution from this game, you can make even the simplest landscapes look like the most tremendous sceneries, that really create a sense of depth and diversity. bethesda, you have made a truly unforgettable game, and anyone that disagrees with that, has to re-think their entire lives. 10/10",7.6

"this might be the best game ive ever played in my life. better then every fps atleast. fpss gets boring after a while, but this game i could play for hours on end. though it might not say on my profile, i have atleast 300 hours. its almost like minecraft, you can play the original and like it. you can play however you want, but then you can add tons of mods which changes the game completely and makes it even better. graphic mods, armor mods, quest mods, cheat mods *cough cough* and expansion mods. and of course theres a lot of good dlcs.",26.4
"well, another review. this time its skyrim if you didnt notice. first off all. i loved this game when i had it on console. it was a good game to waste some time. i have put a lot of hours into this game and i still havent found every single thing in the game. there are also quite a few quests i havent done. went i got it on pc a couple of days ago. i discovered the wonderous world of mods. there are so many mods out there for this game. if you can think of a mod, somebody has probably already made it. anyway, there is too much stuff in this game for me to review in depth. (i like to keep my reviews short(ish)) if this game is on sale, you should pick it up.",66.2
"this game has to be the best role playing game due to how its modding comunity i was surpirsed how amazing the graphics are even to 2015 thanks to the mods of course and the mods just made it so much better i just going to say thing get the game and you will love it, if u like games with mods get this game",217.1
"this g... hell. you dont need me to recommend this. its skyrim.",146.5

"after many, many hours of exploring, shouting people to death, stabbing undead to make them explode, and attempting to ride dragons... i finally finished skyrim. it wasnt the most satisfying ending, but the game feels like it has multiple games within itself. i could recommend skyrim for the side plots over the main plot. also, the creation kit needs to come out already. i want my mods. and my catgirls.",67.5
"what can i say about elder scrolls v, and about elder scrolls generally... -first, theres a huge open world you can explore with a lot locations worth exploring. skyrim awaits... -second, there is perfect skill system, it should be like that in every rpg. you can be both master swordsman and archmage. you can learn every skill and create your unique combat style. -third, probably most important, but i put it third cause open-world and great skill make it lot better... it is story, probably one of the best known game stories, but i will also describe it here... youre dragonborn or doavhkiin on dragon language, hero with mortal body, a soul of dragon and voice stronger than any other mortal or dragon. your desteny is to defeat aduin, dragon who wants to eat world. -fourth, side storylines. they are great, you really should play all of them if you play tes:v. you can participate in civil war, join warriors guild called companions, become archmage, be infamous dark brotherhoods assassin or do crime in thieves guild. -fifth, not so important fot true gamers but it makes gameplay better, graphics... everyone will agree tes:v looks great and really you can really feel like you are in skyrim. i really like it. its one of the beast game i played. 11/10 hope review helps you, theknightmarema p.s. buy the game!",64.1

"i loved the hell out of oblivion. but skyrim has consumed my gaming life for over a year now and im not even close to being tired of it. the level of world immersion i get from it is hard to describe. sometimes im like thats really video-game-y and others i really get a sense of awe from the lore and backstory these games have but what i love most about them is the sense of exploration, coupled with the urge to actually role-play my characters. my khajiit is basically a paladin and would never join the theives guild or the dark brotherhood, so i never did those quests with him. my argonian, however, has no such issues. you can play this game so many different ways, and customize your character to a ridiculous extent. use a few mods to iron out the rough spots (sky ui and catagorized favorites are must-haves) and you have a game that you can literally play forever. im not sure what will come along that dethrones it for me, but right now this is probably my favorite game of the last 5 years.",938.9
"this is one of the best rpgs that i have played in a while. this game has a huge land to explore with suprises everywhere. there might be a vampire attack on a city or a giant destroying almost everything in its path. the weapons have a great variety and a good feal to everyone of them, so does the armour and the armour is especially noticible when fighting or running. you lose more stamina and run slower when wearing heavy armour, and the opposite wehn wearing light. there are a few bugs the annoy me but i was so carried away with the absolute beauty of this game. this game is amazing and has a giant modding community with it. 9.5/10",73.8

"played this game for so many hours on different consoles over and over... 5 stars",34.4
"if you need a review to tell you to get this game, this is it. i started on xbox then moved to pc. skyrim is, well, too much awesome to put in words. it is a masterpiece on its own, and one continually in the making. the reason i say it is continually, is the modding community. the modding community has added so much replay value to an already amazing game. for example, the unofficial skyrim patch is a community effort to make all of the official skyrim and dlc bug-free, and it has fixed tens of thousands of things. not to mention all the mod choices out there. you can have ones that change gameplay, add spells, armour, weapons, houses, add entirely new stories and quest lines, make the game 4x the quality of the hd dlc, or help you run it on an older machine. there are simply too many to mention here, but if you are looking for something, chances are there is already a mod out there for it. as for dlc, they are all excellent. i recommend them all, but i especially have a love for dawnguard. probably because it was the first i owned.",330.9
"this game is amazing!!! you can get mods that make the game better and somehow can even make the graphics better. ive played longer than it says since ive switched accounts so so far maybe 60+ hours. i beat the game as a member of the stormcloaks and it was fun as heck. get the game now if you can!",90.8

"godly. glorious. majestic. perfection. merged together all in one.",394.9

"i highly recommend this game. personally i belive this games age rating is over rated, as there isnt much gore, (well bar decapitation) and swearing is minimal. this game never truely ends, as i have completed all storyines and quests, but restarting and playing from scratch is still a gripping experiance. the modding community is amazing (sometimes xd) and brings a whole new leace of life to a game that strangely resembles game of thrones in a lot of ways...",564.3

"i must be the only person in the world who does not like this game. it is buggy at best! there are glitches in the ai and pathing. npc constantly get stuck. you can glitch out enemies killing them easily. your character constantly gets stuck walking up stairs, really? the story is lame and lacks depth. the in games menus look like they were designed by a lazy person. the voice acting is sub standard, might as well have hired porn stars to do the voice acting. there is zero emotion or thought put into the dialog. not to mention this huge world feels empty and you constantly find yourself running from one end to the other. combat is lame and laborious. overall the game feels lazy and unpolished. can i reccomend this game no. ive spent so much time walking that i only completed 4 quests before getting totally bored.",6.2
"ive played the elder scrolls since morrowwind and this one is the best one yet! i am a khajit that is the leader of the dark brotherhood, a member of the circle in the companions, the arch-mage of the college of winterhold, part of the thieves guild, of course the dragonborn, and many other things. gameplay and graphics are amazing, and this game tells you how to play and then cuts you loose, you can do whatever the hell you want, no ones gonna tell you not to. kill dragons, pickpocket, murder, jump off a mountain, shout the jarl so he glitches into his chair (i do that alot :d), and whatever else! 10/10 would be a murdurer and a pickpocket again!",253.9

"skyrim is a fantastic game, with mods of course. vanilla isnt awful but its not great. mods add great amounts of depth and greatly increase the graphical fidelity(if you have a powerful enough computer). all together i highly recommend skyrim since via pc mods are available. ps modding requires time and commitment be prepared if you wish to use mods.",188.4

"i dont need to say anything about skyrim or other elder scrolls games. they are not compared to other games. other games are compared to elder scrolls. skyrim doesnt deny its origins and is a faithfull part of tamriels conturbated story. skyrim is epic. that would be enough to say but lets say something else as well. it b brings life to the northern side of tamriel as never done before and puts you into the role of the dovahkiin, the dragonborn, a hero, as those sung by bards, born with blood of the dovah, the dragons, and sets you in an adventure that you wont see anywhere else. you will brave the lush fields, snowy pastures, crowded cities and ancient tombs and dungeons of skyrim, where a battle for control is in place while dragons from the past are coming back to life. you will battle thru the guts of dragons and draugr, vampires and werewolves, and help comrades, thieves, assassins, companions and so much more that cant be said and done in these few lines. you are dragonborn and all the secrets of the world await for you!",151.1

"one of my favourite games of all time. have you played elder scrolls before? no problem. skyrim is full of fun references to earlier games. its a little different from morrowind and oblivion but still extremely good. i dont feel like ive wasted any money buying this, nor do i feel like ive wasted a single hour. the game is beautiful - i can stop in my tracks and just admire the world. there is so much to do, so many quests: main quests, faction quests, side qeusts, misc quests - youll never be bored. you dont like being bound by quests? no problem. theres no obligation to follow any quests, its possible to just explore and live the world. the levelling is easy and the game offers many different ways to play - rogue, warrior or mage to name a few.",619.1

"you cant marry ralof, this game sucks. b^( im kidding, of course (eventhoughireallywishyoucouldmarryralofcoughcough) anyway... as an open-world rpg, it is pretty damn fun. theres lots to do, and the story is interesting. being an open-world game, there are quite a few remaining bugs....that bethesda will not fix. theyre done with it; they dont plan on doing anything else with skyrim [sad trombone]. you get to choose a race, thats really cool. character customization, thats a plus too (at least for me). i mean, despite its flaws, this game is really fun and cool. if you have the coin (huehue), get it. i really reccomend it. also if you take the effort to learn the dragon language, i have a high respect for you and would probably smooch ya. (i mean its one thing to learn a real language but to learn a fictional language? hell yeah, thats tight as frick, yo b^] )",366.4

"skyrim is still my favorite game, seriously hands down the best game i have ever played. skyrim still has so much potential with its moddible system and there is in my opion plenty of room for new expansions. skyrim makes you wish there was never an elder scrolls mmo and that they spent that money on skyrim. if your after a game that will have you playing none stop and something that even has replaying value skyrim is for you. if you like adventure and top graphics this is a must buy and its highly recomended as a pc title. you cant lose with this game and owning a legit copy of skyrim garantees all your mods will work so dont think twice about paying. thumbs up to the world of skyrim.",123.6

"anyone who has played any of the elderscrolls line of games know that these are games are a magnet. you might try to step away for a few days, but before you know it your back again. the reason is that the worlds are so large and incredibly detailed, that you virtually find something new every gameplay session. stunning graphics and much simiplified interface over oblivion and morrowind. great voice talent and character interaction brings the world to life. be warned, its a magnet.",252.4
"words cant describe what i have experience in this game honestly like where do i start! 1. mods 2. more mods 3.s of skyrim (must have for immerson) but seriously this game is amazing i remember playing it for the first time on xbox back in late 2011 and now playing it on pc with hundreds of mods! and even though the story is a bit dull compared to oblivion and morrwinds stories and is the basic overused your the chosen one it is still amazing and ive played through it 5 times on different platforms. anyway i recommend this to anyone that enjoys games where you can do what ever the  you want or for people who wanted a challange because you can really change the whole game with mods anyway i keep going off subject besides all the awesome things in this game i will admit that the dragon fights are very very easy and the same repetitive hit them when they get on the ground and asorb there soul crap but thats nothing a couple mods cant fix anyway buy this game just do it!",137.3

"very good game. while the story may not be as good as in previous elder scrolls games, its still a epic game. the fact that you play as a dragonborn is a nice change, which brings me to the shouts. they were a very good addition to the game, and they can be pretty fun, for example unrelenting force (a.k.a. the popular fus ro dah). graphics wise, its not the best there is in terms of textures (theres also shadow striping in some spots), but graphics arent always the main priority of a game. there are bugs, and stuff that should have been in the game, but the dlcs add extra questlines and content which are really great (my favorite is dragonborn, but you may have different opinions). dragonborn and dawnguard add extra questlines and places, and hearthfire gives you the ability to build your own home in 3 places. even so, if you want the game to be perfect, then get the mods you want and your experience will be very great. score: 9/10 (by itself) 9.4/10 (with dlc) 10/10 (with dlc and mods)",147.6

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"super super fun game with a crazy ammount of fun mods",64.9
"completely incompareable to any other rpg game out there. ive never played a finer game in a finer series of games. the amount of time you could spend doing anything is endless. in an open free, vast world, theres plenty of room to do whatever you want, and thats just the regular game! the mod community for skyrim is unlike any i have other seen, and that just sweetens the experience on top of the already-outstanding official dlc that goes with it. it really did live up to its potential in the elder scrolls series, and even exceeded it. after playing morrowind and oblivion, i can say that i have nothing to be upset with. as a former player of morrowind and oblivion, i have only just recently gotten skyrim for pc, and it still doesnt get old. my advice would be that if able, try out a bit of morrowind, and oblivion so you can get your taste set in on the elder scrolls, or if you want, you can just jump right into skyrim. the graphics: 10/10 the storyline: 10/10 the choices: 10/10 recommendation: buy this game (now)",55.7
"great game, made even better with support from steam workshop. although i would recommend checking out skyrim nexus if you want an even better modding experience.",416.5
"my prelimenary opinion would be that this game is even more awesome than the ones that came before. i was a big gamer when it came to oblivion and i do miss some of the pleasant features of that game in the skyrim gameplay. luckely, in my opinion, the conversationwheel was parted with. a big plus for skyrim is the smithing-feature as are the dragons obviously and the medieval, scandinavian, mythological feeling in-game. regarding to the use of magic, i think it was a great move on the part of the developpers to go with these shouts...very well done. each factions, race, etc. is now even more diverse than in previous games. a big point of critique is that bethesda still has a lot men and women in the game talking in the same voice (but of course it is obvious as to why that is so). the vanilla world map could use some improvement, if you are against using mods for this. as a big fan over the series, i think a 9 out of 10 (with oblivion being 8,5 and morrowind a 7) is an appropriate mark for the elder scrolls v skyrim.",79.3
"the most anticipated rpg-game of the year. now you can go dragonborning all over skyrim! ...... dragonborning, its a word. look it up, kids!",533.7
"a game that no one should hate, best game ever to be playing even when there mods. anyone who hate this game are just a hater and a no one so pay no attention to them. this game can cause anyone to be playing for more than 400+hr and it wont stop there.",70.2
"probably the best game out there to this day. vast world of surprizes and it seems like you can never play the game the same way twice.",63.4
"i started out playing this game on console with about 200-300 logged hours total. after having done everything possible in the vanilla game, playing this already great game on the pc, made it even better. there are so many mods in the steam community and through other sources, such as nexus mods, that you arent even going to know where to begin. so if you are prepared to spend countless hours playing an awesome game with a very large selection of optional mods to choose from, then this is the rpg for you.",28.7
"what can i say. super addicting. totally my type of game.",303.6
"i like this. i got it last summer during the sale, but just before my sister got it for $9.99 and literally a minute after, a flash sale happened for $4.99 and she was all like dontgetitnow! and i was all like no.",232.6
"a masterpiece of the open world rpg genre. the base game alone has mountains of content. but when you add on the offical dlc and the many mods that can be found on steam workshop as well as the nexus, its a game that really has no end.",132.7
"awesome game, very long story, wyrmstooth mod is free and very long, and the adventuring aspect is quite good, although i wish the caves/dungeons would respawn instead of just being left desolate after i just completely destroy them.",179.4
"its one of the best games i ever played but theres still a lot of glitches for a game that came out in 2011 10/10",49.8
"you should buy this because of all the crazy and weird modz you can install and plus to test the extent of how powerful you computer id and it still looks good even on low setting and it runs smoothly",139.4

"best game ever, no game will never overdue this game! buy for sure",452.6
"skyrim is one of the best free exploration games i have ever known. it is based off of the elder scrolls series (hence elder scrolls v) and is a medival type of game. you can steal, pickpocket, and the graphics are great. the 30 dollars it takes to buy this game is definatly worth it.",86.5
"after putting in 100+ hours on the xbox 360 version, i still bought this game a second time through steam. even after 2 years since its release, im still loving this game. its just one of those games you can always go back to and find something new to try out.",90.7
"very nice graphics, very immersive environment and story. mods allow to extend the playtime atleast tenfold. buy dis",132.9
"one of my favorite games! go to the nexus forums and download player made mods to make the game even better!",157.4
"paid 60$ for this game when it was released. almost 300 hours of play time since. zero regrets. wonderful game.",300.6
"honestly, what cant be said about skyrim that hasnt been said already? the game is everything you want out of the series minus all the garbage clogging up the previous games. its beautiful looking, even moreso in motion, has fantastic modding support, and can sustain you for a very very very long time. to top it all off, the game goes on sale for super cheap, making this one of the easiest recommendations i can make. buy this game and mod it to hell and back.",103.0
"amazingly fun, loads of quests and with the possibilities of the steam workshop anything is possible",199.8
"i just finished my first play-through of the game with no mods. i am a fan of the series and this one delivers. the game is very open-ended and you get what you put into it so your experiences will vary. i will compare my experience between oblivion and skyrim: gameplay- combat has been improved and leveling feels more natural. terrain feels impassible at times. the map is huge! visuals- although the visuals have improved, i think oblivion had more revolutionary graphics for its time. i also feel that oblivion with its forests was a more beautiful game and skyrim seems a bit too bleak and barren and lacks color and details sometimes. (you can probably fix this with mods) interface- has changed and it took some time to get used to the quickslots. the menus are clearly designed with a controller in mind, but it is quick and efficient to use once you get the hang of it. plot- i dont want to spoil any of the plot, but i will say that i liked the factions and how they tied to the lore. very solid plot. dragons?- yes there are dragons! yes they do get boring very quickly. overall- one of the most entertaining and replayable games you can get on the pc. i look forward to modding it and replaying the game with a different character.",133.0
"first, and most importantly, i love the elder scrolls series. skyrim included. so much great stuff to explore and the vast openness of the world is its true shining aspect. tons of lore. tons of loot. tons of dialogue. tons of everything...including bugs. this is by far the buggiest game ive played on steam, and it was almost a deal breaker in the beginning. big no no bethesda. consoles be damned, pc needs to be made priority. dont shun your core. tons of potential with this one, but it hangs by a thread over the maw of mediocrity. thanks for a great game. do a little better job next time on the spit shine and itll be back where it needs to be to remain on top.",79.0
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim, what could i say about this fantastic game! as always bethesda has give us a masterpiece of a game, bethesda is used to make high detailed open world rpg games, following fallout 3 from 2008 with the open world high detail terain they did it again, but in a much larger world with much more stuff to explore, tod howard is a genious... the story is great, some kind of fetish for prisoners is what bethesda loves, but the whole game is unbeatable, even after you finish the game and start all over again you will find something new, random events are great, so it gives you planty of side quests, apsolutly an amazing game, 9.5/10",158.2
"this game is still incredible, even 2 years after release. at the time of writing this, i have 392 hours clocked, and i do not intend to stop any time soon. skyrim lets you be who you want to be; a heroic warrior, an evil assassin, a greedy theif, a powerful mage. with its class-free open ended skill system there are so many different playstyles available. another advantage of this game is the amazing and still active modding community, giving the game near unlimited replay value. i recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs, or just open-world games in general. it also has dragons, in case you needed any more convincing.",521.7
"skyrim is an excellent rpg capable of suck many hours from your life. it tells numerous engaging stories and delivers an immersive experience in the frozen nothern lands of skyrim. if youve played other elder scrolls titles you have a decent idea of what to expect, if not youre likely going to be pleasantly suprised. the steam workshop mod support for this game open up a contanstly growing database of new, east to install content. well worth the money.",377.8
"would highly suggest this game to anybody not sure about buying it.",363.3
"skyrim is such a great game! i havent had a decent gaming computer for a long time and now that i have built one i wanted to try playing it on pc, and its true, you havent lived until you play skyrim on pc compared to console. its soooo immersive and there are soooo many different things you can do. i do wish they came out with more dlc for the game but the modding communtiy is spectacular!",70.2
"definitely my favorite in the series! skyrim is a smooth play experience with so many different options that it makes the game replayable over and over again. if youre choosing between pc and console, go wtih pc. the controls feel a lot smoother and give you more manuverability. excellent game!",10.7
"dis game is like so good. so much to do its endless! the mods for skyrim are also great to play around with when you are bored apart from some of the mods breaking my quests its still great :d",37.2
"ive said this amidst all the hype when it was initially released and ill say it now; its not as good as oblivion. its still great, i love it. the addition of wyverns fills the void of lacking variety in the environment. ive not played the dlc but it allegedly adds a lot. i recommend it.",22.2
"elder scrolls skyrim is an amazing game. i highly recommend it, if you enjoyed previous elder scrolls games, you will most likely enjoy this one, like the previous elder scrolls you were able to just wander off and do whatever you wanted via dungeon or find someone that need help and it turns out to be question. great game youll spend tons of time playing it",117.0
"the game is massive, entertaining, fun and filled with bugs and broken game mechanics. even though it represents another step away from the best game of the series (morrowind) i keep playing it because there is nothing else like it out there. dont get the dawnguard expansion, it ruins the game by randomly offing npcs during scripted random vampire attacks (why they decided to put those in there is a freaking mystery of galactic proportions).",271.5
"this game is teriffic i just love it the controls are nice and responcive and it really feels like your in skyrim.",302.3
"i think its one of the best games ever. so full of things to do also it is the top 3 games with the most mods along with gmod with the mods it makes skyrim 10 times better and skyrim is brilliant. what i love about bethesda games is that you make your own choices and you are who you are, not a already created character.",580.1
"i could go on and on about the things they didnt exactly do right, so ill say the fact: oblivion was better than skyrim morrowind was better than oblivion. it really feels like they are dumbing down the series with each es they make morrowind felt like the hardcore rpg that should be how they should be made no quest markers, no stealing indicator, no stealth indicator, monsters followed rules of logic, (ghosts cant be harmed by normal weapons ect.) you actually had to depend on your skils and wit, where as skyrim the general thought process consisted of run in and hit it till it dies which requires no thought obviously. so for skyrim it comes down to do you want hours of doing anything you can think of but at the cost of unchallenging fights? or do you want a game that makes you think before you fight and actually require prior planning?. overall would i reccomend it? no. though i will say the game is fun it just lacks the rpg elements of its elders and feels more hack and slash if anything.",164.8
"this game is epic, no games match it except the elder scrolls iv: oblivion, and maybe fallout 3, but this game is epic! for these reasons, you can kill anything you want, with steam mods galore, and you can do practically anything. buy a house get married (dlc) get a kid build your own house become a vampire become a kitty ride a dragon kill nazeen go to jail participate in a war fus ro da! and many, many more awesome stuff.",372.2
"theres not much i can say about this game, just that it (and its soundtrack) are amazing. it has around 20 hours of quests (with the dlcs) and the enviroment is beautiful, but its safe to say, without this games soundtrack, it wouldnt be half the game it is now.",30.2
"this is one my my favourite games ever made. you will be playing it for hours and hours. the community behind the game is amazing and the mods are the best of any game in my opinion. they enhance the game even more. i love the world and the characters and its unfortunate i will have to wait like 5 more years for elder scrolls vi 10/10",194.4
"this game is absolutely fantastic. i literally do not know a single person who would tell you otherwise. it is a master piece of video game worl. altough i dont have a lot of time played on pc, i have played over 300 hours on consoles. seriously, just buy the game already.",11.0
"this game is great, i have over 100 hours on xbox. i found this on sale so i got it. anyways, the world is vast and intreaguing, and it is nearly impossible to complete the whole thing. i highly recommend this game to anybody. unless your a ing  and hate good games. or if youre a .",37.4
"you can kill people and have a beard. do i need to say any more? 10/10",22.7
"its honestly the best thing that has happen to my life.",249.2
"vanilla skyrim is bland and boring, leaving much to be desired. nearly every single actionable course is greetings. i am x, i need/want/lost y. its now at/with z and you either oblige or move on. the game is riddled with bugs and glitches and in general i got the feeling that this was a solid alpha or beta that needed more uniqueness, polish, and stability. normally youd expect a thumbs down, but, enter in the mod community and bam, what an amazing experience. you need somewhere around 50sih mods (dlc/updates/textures/unofficial fixes for offical stuff/weather mods/interesting/immersive npcs/ a model mod like cbbe/frostfall/ect) but after getting a solid list of updates and immersion mods (you can go a step further and add wepons and armor) the game itself becomes a living, breathing event not to dissimilar to a good d&d game. i recommend this game, not on account of what the publishers have done, but because of what the modders have turned this into. skyrim fans/modders made my purchase worth it, hands down.",216.6
"after logging over 140 hours on the ps3 version and earning a platinum trophy for the game, i am now attempting a second full playthrough on the pc, mods and all. i have to say, with a dozen mods running that improve textures, lighting, add birds and wild horses, and enhance both the weather and ambient noise, skyrim on pc is a whole different ball game. dont just take my word for it.",26.5
"definately one of the greatest games i have ever played, last gen game however with new immersion mods etc coming out all the time, it feels next gen. plenty of different storylines, all completely optional. many play styles you suit you and an all round brilliant game.",321.1
"ahh yes the elder scrolls v was a very good game for the rpg style gameplay like fallout games with customizing your character the gameplay is amazing the storyline is that your a prisoner that you could give him or her a name is up to you how u want to make your character look like. +++gameplay and graphics +++weapons and spells +++good voice acting +++soundtrack if you like a rpg game like the elder scroll this game is for you",9.0
"the game is fairly fun, but personally i find it lacks complexity and its impossible to fail a quest. it makes the game less fun as an effect as you dont feel mastery as you would in dark souls. this makes skyrim more an rpg on rails.",172.6
"highlight any glaring weaknesses of skyrim difficult. some moments, say, work and beneficial to the game, and harm. for example, the camera. first person view was the best decision in the early nineties, but now it may well be abandoned in favour of a form of a third party. then fights probably would become more dynamic. however, without the view from the eyes youll have nothing at the elder scrolls. many fans would not accept the change. ultimately, the only thing that matters is how the game was fun, and in this respect skyrim is at the height. from it extremely difficult to break away: her pulsating with city life world addictive head. bethesda once again demonstrated aerobatics, creating the game simultaneously extensive and easy to learn, conservative, and having dug.",23.0
"trying to ignore the actual roads and instead climbing mountains to take the most direct road has never been this fun.",265.0
"simply one thing: buy it. theres no need to be an rpg-over9000-master to enjoy this game in its full scale. its more than worth its money, so get it now!",207.6
"mods!!! open world! mods!! stealth-able! mods!! nuff said",88.7
"easily one of the most fun games ive played in a long time. not really sure if it qualifies as an rpg since there seem to be consequences for most of your actions, but still really fun.",217.9
"it is skyrim, need i say more? haha. great game alone, even better when it is modded. between pc and xbox, i have documented over 800 hours on this baby :p",321.6
"the elder scrolls games are all masterpieces in their own right, but skyrim is truly the crowning glory of this series. from the details given to each race and the extremely custumizable factor from character creation to even your own varied playstyle, skyrim allows you to be exactly who you wish while immersing you in a wildly beautiful land full of adventure and oppportunity. let wanderlust take hold and your instincts guide you through battles with fierce dragons and bands of armed bandits. this game is so feature rich that its difficult to summarize in a short review. its best that anyone who hasnt done so yet just go for it. you will not be disappointed.",13.6
"skyrim on pc is amazing! it ruined my life but worth it 100% recommend!",433.3
"i have bought time game 4 times so far. one on my console, where i played for over 200 hours before starting a second character (then playing for another few hundred hours across other builds). i have bought it for my pc and if you are a fan of the game on console and are unsure if it is worth it... it is. the ability to mod this game is just amazing. there are so many amazing mods. from skyre to change the combat up, enb and other visual mods (static mesh improvement mod is the most notable for me, along with water and flora mods), falskaar to add new lands... this game just keeps on giving and giving. twice have i bought the legendary edition on sale. just because it was on sale and gaben pls. it makes a nice gift, except that the games so awesome that everyone has it. i highly recommend this to anyone who has not got it.",120.5

"the best game iv ever played! it is realy funn to play, it has a lot of missions and allot of different races and skills to level up, so many classes to choose. i would recommend this game to every one that likes some thing that involves many stuff like dragons, vampyres, open world,",11.3
"its skyrim, an elder scrolls game with modern visuals great modding tools and a ton of content, there is no way to go wrong with the game. you can have fun here whether youre an action fan, or if role playing is more your style this game was made for you! it is all the elder scrolls goodness wrapped up into one neat modern package and it would be a shame if you didnt at least try it! also getting to play the game again after running through it on xbox was just a treat so even if you think youve already seen all there is to see, you havent.",5.6

"this game is amazing!!! skyrim is in my opinion one of the best games i have ever played and i think that it is the best game in the series. this open-world game is truly that, open. you can do anything you want in this game, so for example you could want to be a warrior in the beginning, but it is still completely possible to decide you want to try to level up as a thief or mage without there being restrictions on what you can level up with like in other games in the series. i have skyrim on consoles as well, and this version is just as great, and possibly even better because of mods and improved graphics if your computer can handle it. basically, this game is pure, fantastic freedom, and deserves all the praise it gets.",115.0
"your kids kids will be playing this game or another version. the only thing to stop this game is the company itsself. i would rank this game series up there with civ5. i will say sims and sim city series also. when you come across a good game it just stays with you. this game is wide open. never are you made to go to point and and talk to ted and go kill 10 of this and pick 10 of this plant. you have a main quest then you have a civil war and then you have a wide open world with people to help and deep dark dungeons forts castles and numerous other places to explore. with the hearthfire add on you can even build your own house and adopt children if thats what you want to do. go slay a dragon and come home and have dinner with the wife and kids. that is unmodded skyrim. go on the workshop or nexus and you can spend days looking at mods to do just about anything you want to do. the elder scrolls modding world is one of the most open and friendly mod communites you will ever find. if you want a fantasy rpg where you decide where to go or what to do then this is the game for you. i hope you enjoy it just as much as i have and still do.",766.8
"by far one of the best games of all time. if you havent had a chance to play any games from the elder scroll series, i would highly reccommend this one. great graphic, great story, great combat! id give this game a 10/10. if you liked this one, go pick up morrowing or oblivion. also, make sure to get the elder scrolls online in april! :d",97.3

"this game is way too addicting, but that is mainly because it is just so amazing with the way that it allows for fantasy style gameplay integrated with thousands of mods. if youre a fan of immersive rpgs, modable first-person environments, and/or amazing scenery (especially with texture mods), this is the game for you. gameplay can be adapted for people who like anything from simple slash-and-bash games to more elaborate role playing, and therefore, as long as you dont have some unexplainable need for guns, this game can bend to your every whim. it does take time to get used to though, as this is nothing like tetris.",249.9

"its skyrim. it came out in 2011 on the 10/11/11 (broken release date) hated it at first; too much like fallout 3 for an elder scrolls game i thought. fast travel a few years later and i seem to quite like the game, dont know what happened. i still prefer oblivion but hey, its the elder scrolls, the series has been going on now for 20 years, you know what your getting in to. 8/10",13.5
"really good game. better than oblivion, while almost as good as morrowind.",45.1
"one of the best rpgs/open world games i ever played on steam.",22.0
"i always wanted to replay oblivion, but after spending so many hours on my first run through, i could never bring myself to do it again. then comes skyrim. i love this game. so epic and imersive, it creates a world and atmosphere unlike any other game. every time i play i end up getting side-tracked with some cave or another, but that is what i love about skyrim. it would definately be in my top 5 modern games.",75.0
"you need a recommendation? are you kidding me?! buy. this. game. rpg fan or not. this is something all gamers need to play.",128.2
"if you havnt played this game then you must get it",57.3
"its got a few hours of content, its an alright game.",1058.5
"very good game! maybe the best of the series! lots hours of fan but when you level up is getting less challenging.",258.8
"this is a great game with a ton to do in it, from fighting dragons, to slaying mages. almost anything can happen in skyrim, if you are looking for a good game to dump hours into, i would suggest skyrim.",263.4
"highly recommended fantasy rpg ive played morrowind, oblivion sor thousands of hours. now i cant find enough time to spend on skyrim! its a huge world for you to explore at your pace, meeting distinctive characters, battling all kinds of brigands and monsters. the crafting system is simple and intuitive, so you can craft yourself better weapons and armor as you progress if you invest some time in gathering the resources and honing your skills. there is no one single way to play the game or win battles. you are free. what road will you take next?",232.8
"perfect game! i cannot stop playing! its so worth it!",486.4
"absolutely phenomenal game. wholeheartedly addicting. beware.",100.9
"amazing free rome game and can do anything you rilly want to do and the workshop mods are about everything",399.5
"the game with infinite possibilities! it seems that even simple got to this cave and get this then come back missions take hours instead of minutes. the exploration and imagination involved is wonderful and refreshing.",75.7
"ok..... where to begin.. ow... here this game is awesome !!!! if your fan of anytype of game like good story, good combat, funny dialogue,.....whatever comes to your head....this is it it has good community whit loots of mods, upgrades, new quests and list is on and on...... soo if i could shout  awe sooo meeeeeeeee soo i recommend it for anyone!!",183.8
"love it better than elder 4 but all the elder scroos are kool , im also loving the beta testing on the online one too",41.5
"skyrim is one of the finest games i have played in my lifetime. it beats almost every other rpg i have ever played in graphics and gameplay. the story is a bit lacking with some confusing plot points, but it is still fun to complete. the modding community is what really makes this game, though. the graphics were, at the time of release, worshipped by the internet for how amazing they were. now, they rival games like crysis while still being fairly stable with the addition of just a few mods. 9/10. if you dont own this game, you are missing out on a cornerstone of video game history.",60.0
"if you like adventure this one is for you. best rpg ever",121.7
"mod this game and its one of the deepest, most absorbing game of the last generation. without mods its kind of shallow in my opinion, a problem i didnt have with the fallout games. i can honestly say ive crossed the mark where theres no more fun in it for me, but trust me, youll enjoy this one. its awesome for the most part! also, thomas the train.",215.3
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",71.8
"my favorite game is skyrim just buy it you will not regret",56.9
"recommended for about 15$ for content in it. maybe if that. for vanilla. with mods such as midas magic, quest to ever-something *sorry, forgot the name!* and wyrmtooth, alongside other combat/ quest mods, itd be worth 25$, easily. recommending because it is a good game, but lacks real quality of exploration that games like morrowind and prior had.",237.2
"ive played about 70 hours now and im probably less then 1/4 of the way through the game. this is one of the best games i have ever played, and i was never a fan of the other elder scrolls. i have had multiple boss fights that have took me upwards to 15 to 20 even possibly 30 minutes, and i never felt frustrated but i did feel challenged. this is one game that a 60 dollar price tag is actually under-priced.",417.1
"the best open world experience in the series. the best way to enjoy this game is to download a mod to make dragons spawn at greater rates. there are really good mods out there that make the game authentic, or to add something the developers didnt. this game is quite a journey - when you dont use the console commands. dont do it - its a bad habit. take it from me.",844.9
"this game is awsome and a must play when you buy the game your going to have a awsome time playing and if you get bored then get mods on the steam workshop thay will inprove your gameplay :) so good job steam ten outa ten beat buy evar waring:game will cause lost of social live and events.",26.3
"one of the best games ive ever played. total freedom to do almost whatever you want, and do it in whatever order you want. mods add even more to the game to do. even after hundreds of hours played, one will still find stuff to discover, things to do, enemies to kill.",317.2
"i played it like mad until completion, but never touched it again after the ending. it was tons of fun while it lasted.",73.2
"this game....is hideously complicated. i say this in all love of that particular aspect of the work, but i must preface any glowing recommendation (and this is one) with that small acknowledgement - be prepared to devote long leisure hours and short daydreams to this world, and now you shall be forever changed; either into a fan or into some broken wreak, snivelling at a keyboard in fear of the mere word thuum.....",355.3
"this is my 3rd playthrough (with the first 2 being on xbox 360). playing on pc has opened me up to a ton of free mod content. its unlikely most of my steam library will get much attention for quite a while.",18.0
"if you hate your life, play this masterpiece, live through a virtual persons eyes.",704.1
"this game goes on forever! you are playing this game for the story as the combat is total . things also get a bit awkward if you get too many levels as enemies can start doing either 1) stupendo damage or 2) seeing you in stealth from miles away. pickpocketing is a terrible mechanic. the civil war storyline is rather unfullfilling. even though im mostly saying bad things - this game is really fun and a blast to explore.",168.7
"whether youre hunting dragons, upgrading your house, or trying to shut up those stupid plants, theres plenty in this game to keep you going for hour after hour.",455.7
"i wasted many an hour playing this game, would recommend",377.7
"i believe that the elder scrolls: skyrim is one of the best games ive ever played. this game has an unlimited amount of detail, fun, and story. even more counting the dlc and the steam workshop. this game can easily top many games that will be made in the future that are supposedly more advanced. whenever a new open world rpg is released they just do the same thing that skyrim does but with less detail. i hope the next sequels of the elder scrolls franchise will maintain the fantastic feel as the one you get playin skyrim.",154.1
"i have 524 hours on xbox and 121 on my old steam,this game is great if you install mods (some just break your game) can make in theory a never ending game",108.9
"need to kill a few hundred hours? skyrims for you.",302.3
"this game is just too awesome to describe... there is too much content to even make a review all you need to know is that its a must for all gamers especially pc players",294.3
"i have clocked in over 50 hours of this game i still havent completed the main quest! if you run out of things to do in skyrim (which will take a very long time considering how big the game is) you can always buy the dlcs which are incredible. overall a sick game btw you can also chop peoples head off : )",73.3
"another open world success! hundreds of hours of gameplay lie within. really, when it comes to the open world experience no one does it better than bethesda.",230.3
"best game ive played ever awesome graphics and enjoyable cutscenes. all kinds of weapons and armour, magic and so much more. if u want to know how it really is, you should buy it. because there arent enough words to describe the awesomeness",89.3
"as some of the tags say addicting more like life sucking because this game has so many mods to play/tamper with i played with 34 during my 5th run and i didnt even recognize the game.",110.5
"immersing as hell!!!! you will be drowned in it!!! it will devour hours and days of your life, and totally worth it",47.6
"this game does not have the best combat. this game does not have the best crafting system. it does not have very good difficulty scaling, and its quite easy to put together a few abilities to break the game. it doesnt have interesting skill progression, and it isnt the prettiest game out there. what it does have is a massive world filled with lore, filled with factions (which could use a bit of fleshing out and interaction, but still), filled with secrets and new things to discover. the sheer freedom and vastness is enough to let you forget about some of the rougher parts of the game and...immerse yourself in another world. still though, some of those rougher parts are a bit annoying, but thankfully, a huge modding community has done a lot for the game. things like skyui make the inventory much better for pc users, skyre or requim overhaul combat and progression to be balanced and interesting, and lots of smaller mods make the game look so much better, make the towns bigger and have more life, add more people to the roads and cities, add new interesting quests, and let you create the experience you want.",586.0
"kinda boring.. only paid ten bucks for it though. this game is for some one who is really really bored.",19.8
"a couple years ago i bought oblivion, and didnt have much fun with it (all i did in oblivion was see how high i could get my bounty. i never touched quests. at this point in time i wasnt really interested in rpgs or games i have to scavenge in. dead island and warframe took care of that. i got this game thinking i wouldnt play it much because of my experiance with oblivion. i was so wrong. i booted it up as soon as it finished downloading and havent played another game since. ive completed the main questline and the main questlines for dawnguard and dragonborn, but i still have so much more todo. plus the steam workshop has so much to offer, and so does creation kit. this has so far been one of the best games ive played on steam. if you get it, say good bye to actually getting real life stuff accomplished.",65.9
"this game is like terraria small measly dagger and before you kno it fus ro dah and dadric armer and sowrds form being one shoted to one shoting",259.1
"omg.. only game stoped me frm playing csgo for more than 2 days",84.6
"this game by far to say awesome would be an understatement, hundreds of side quests, an in-depth system for combat, new special steath kills not to mention combo moves, pretty much take all elder scrolls games, bung them together and then double it and you have skyrim!!",197.5
"really fun to just run around and do quest. one of the most enjoyable games ive played in a while. i would highely recommend this game.",76.4
"i love first person games..prefer it actually...this game is beautiful..i look forward to putting many hours into playing this one.",1.0
"thsi dispicable attempt to bring the musical wicked to the big screen should be viewed by know one. the performances by betty white and clark kent were contrived and unoriginal falling short of their cost benefit analysis.",9.2
"good-ish game i guess, didnt enjoy it much. if you are gonna purchase the game you must take into concideration that the game has a lot of bugs and glitches, watch some videos on youtube if you have to. all in all, a 7/10 from me. pretty disapointing and they could of done better.",196.5
"i used to have a social life like you, until i took a skyrim to the knee",37.1
"i think the elder scrolls series is the best but for the really game play action and role playing things get this game. this game feaures some amazing things, as i should say, i have spent over 100 hours doing this and the xbox version of it. the elder scrolls skyrim is featured in the lost ages, or so i think because of its use in magic, which is really really cool, and the use of its weapons: swords, sheilds, and my all time favorite, the bow-and-arrow and just for effect, the claws. i highly recommend you get this game and all the dlcs that follow it. the claws belong to the werewolf ability that you get in game. see you there.",104.7
"it is epic and i highly recommend this game it is the best game for any one that is in to adventure games",45.6
