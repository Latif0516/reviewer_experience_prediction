"420/10 not as good as skyrim its alright i guess though -#ign",740.7
"this game is truly amazing. launching it is like a gateway drug, to more counter strike. if you want some tense, nervewracking clutch situations, competitive is for you, but be warned; silvers will do the most messed up tactics, call you a hacker if you see them or kill them, or if you even win a game, i never knew how many 12 year olds had ed so many peoples mums there is not enough lifevests left. however, there are some good community servers too, full with surf, hs deathmatch, jailbreak, bhop etc. which is good until you meet the admins, 90% of admins are 12 year old donators who abuse the  out of their power",627.3
"this game has a feature were you can turn $2.50 into 10! then you bet that 10 skin you just got on csgo lounge to try and make your money back, but then lose the bet. outraged you decide to buy another key, hoping that this will make up your money by pulling a knife, only to find that you got another 10 skin. hundreds of dollars later, finally you think you have learnt your lesson, to not buy keys and decide to buy a skin straight off the market for full price. being still resonably new to the game, you click the unknown link, unaware of what is going on, you later realise that you have been scammed. thats right that skin you bought, more expensive then the game, and all 10 skins you have purchased for $2.50 are gone. outraged once again, you start this process all over, this time knowing the chances of you pulling a knife and making your money back are extremely, slim, but you feel that this will be the one, lol nope get rekt son, 69 skin.",440.1
"since i started to play counter strike global offensive a new world opened for me! with all the tactics i learned from this game life has become easier for me. whenever ill go running im sure to take a knife with me so i can run even faster then i usually do! i made a fake bomb and painted an a on the floor in the living room. whenever i come out of the shower i wrap my towel around my head and pretend to be a terrorist. i pick up the bomb i made and run around in my house. when i reach the living room i plant it on the a side and make some beeping sounds. sometimes my dog gets close to me when i plant and he starts to lick my rectal opening. i think this is just one of the side effects of playing this game. my family thinks im crazy and my girlfriend left me because of it. this game has become life for me and i dont know what i should do without it. thank you gaben, i accept you as my lord and saviour. gaben is love, gaben is life.",1221.7
"go play call of duty, this games not 4 u - gaben",918.2
"bought game played game got killed by a russian kicked the russian got banned 5/5 would play again if werent banned for 7 days.",1216.4
"its best first person shooter game available on steam. community is very much active and game is updating every month and so. good official servers and support. awesome. better graphics, new guns that have been update from css, and the game itself is similar to css, which in my opinion is a great thing and its only $15. overall great game.",957.1
"worth every penny and agonizing moment of depression.",1515.4
"a great game for all who think their self-esteem is too high and needs to be taken down a notch (all the way)",561.7
"cs:go is very realistic, the biggest similarity with real life being the fact that they both suck balls. also, dont forget to buy our keys for only $2.49 for a chance to get a gun with a texture made in gimp in 5 minutes that makes it look like a hot wheels toy.",41.4
"just perfect fps game. if youve played counter strike before, global offensive probably sounds a whole lot like counter-strike and for me killing in global offensive makes me feels good. this game has the best chicken al of gaming history xd",1193.9
"this is why i dont have a life. 10/10 would binge again",1300.7
"i really like this game, some of the stuff needs to get fixed. like, the problem with russian speaking bots in matchmaking. i feel like its a very weird glitch and it happends very often. otherwise i really enjoy this game, 10/10",801.4
"got banned for 7 days for killing a troll once who killed 2 people prior (needless to say he didnt get banned). i put over 50 into this game and valve just  on my face for it.  you valve you . 10/10 flawless banning system.",225.6
"i love this game! if you decide to buy this game heres 10 tips: 1) your ears are your eyes. 2) echo = eco 3) avp = awp 4) top left you have radar. learn to use it. 5) the guns have rubber barrels so when you hold the trigger for more than 3 shots, the bullets will go all over the screen. 6) p90 was crafted by gods so its users are not hackers. 7) if you have the bomb, sit behind your team like a good dog. 8) the games secret name is counter-strike: dust 2. 9) competitive is the main game mode but there are other modes for your little kids too! 10) if you easily get brain cancer just from losing one match stay away from competitive! you psycho! p.s. im not a doctor.",316.1
"steam just offered to write a review for cs: go. i dont own cs: go and havent played it, but who could say no to gabe almighty? so dont be like me, play your games before reviewing them.",1.6
"csgo is the international soviet communication system (scs) and it was built by vladimr putin himself to give russians a communication system to talk with each other! oh, and also by this so called game we got to know that russians are s running around and screaming how pathetic everyone exept other russians are. this game is about putin/10    . and of course i recommend this game lol it has russians!!!",232.9
"would my review really help you to buy this game? i hate this game but its addicting._.",1600.0
"the game itself is good, however, the community sucks.",192.7
"its got a toxic community that will make you literally want to punch a hole in a foreigners face. its got its own economy full of scammers. its got a betting industry addictive enough to bleed you dry of all your skins. its got ban mechanics that make you regret not waiting a week for your last ban to cool off. its got shooting mechanics that require immense skill and will test your patience just as much as hotline miami. its cs:go and it gives everyone that plays it anger problems. and yet we all still play it. why? because its too bloody good at making us want to jump back into a competitive match and improve.",216.7
"man this game is the greatest fps around nobody does it better than this!! the creators and all around leader in multiplayer team and tactics shooter there is.... period.",920.5
"honestly, whether you can aim or not is irrelevant. the true definition of skill is your ability to argue with everyone. people being put into 5v5 teams is just to create the illusion of a team game. its actually 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1. whoever rustles the most jimmies wins. also just like to add that the russians are currently dominating at this sport at the moment.",341.0
"high potential, but thats about it. -worst community of any game i have seen in my 20 years -regular players just  about how matchmaking and the like suck all the time -ridiculous amount of scammers for pathetically expensive skins -joining servers is still the same as it was a decade ago -hardly fleshed out at all, including competitive -encourages kids to throw their parents money at the wall -getting into the game is nigh-impossible with incredibly unwelcoming casual community, and incredibly elitist competitive community -why do the characters hands look ? -every update makes the game stutter like crazy for some people. +great physics and maps. if you buy this game dont take it seriously or youll end up sad, confused, and devoid of money i have 4000 hours in garrys mod but at least i got laid because of it",180.0
"the most skill-based fps in my opinion. if youre good in it youll be good in almost every other fps game.",857.6
"great game, nice skins overall and the game is pretty fun but there is one thing that i have to complain about and thats server tick. competitive servers use 64 tick servers and esports use 128 tick servers. this causes more lag and a slightly difference in aiming. 64 tick servers seem to be off (for me) my cursor is on them and the shots do not connect (ping is fine and under 50). i would still recommend this game to friend. p.s - stop putting this game on sale its the cause of mass hackers and smurds (not a typo) smurfing nerds. <3 pros: - nice gun skins - in game voice chat - in game item drops - competitive scene cons: - on sale often (allows more cheater and smurf accounts) - server tick 64 (could be 128 and valve has the money)",1157.5
"looks and feels very similar to the older games in the series. you can still have fun even if youre not the best player with the competitive matchmaking system; youll get grouped with people around the same skill level as you and the system seems to work pretty well. the game goes on sale for less than $7.50 frequently so there really is no excuse not to try it out!",39.1
"counter strike global offensive is a worthy successor of counter strike 1.6: - the graphics are great - it has all the good old maps - fun gameplay - new guns - sound-quality and weapon-models are better - over 50.000 items and maps on workshop this is the best counter strike imo. 10/10*",612.2
"buy p90 + kevlar and helmet, some flashes and you are ready to go for global elite.",1118.1
"this game tought me that: -killing chikens worths the same as killing terrorists -everyone can be russian -terrorsits get dollar for killing americans -it doesnt matter, if you win or lose, you get money anyways -you can be noob because of anything -you can be kicked for everything -giving headshots means youre a hacker -getting headshots means youre a noob -the guy with the least points gets drops -12 years old will  your mother -p90 is op -scar20 is op -a+ on russian exam 110/10",667.9
"faze clan would get rekt by a silver 2. 10/10 - i can make cod kiddies ragequit and get banned for a week",640.9
"its surely the best cs so far, if you can overlook the fact that competitive matchmaking ranks mean nearly nothing, as well as if you can deal with being kicked and consequentially put in matchmaking cooldown by a team of four people. you can also invest few thousands of dollars to buy fancy weapons. a good game in the end, but only if you play it with friends.",717.4
"i bought this game with 3.75.but the skins cost me more than 375. counter-ers: skins offensive.",430.5
"poke your head out, come on poke your head out, boom headshot have been on the giving and receiving end of that 10/10 would poke my head out again",250.1
"probably the most realistic gambling simulator on the market right now, 10/10.",239.1
"joined a comp game got in to a russian team was the best 1 of the team they called me  and noob 10/10",348.1
"this game is like doing cocain. when you first start it doesnt seem very appealing, and maybe it hurts a little. but then you experence this rush, and you have to have more. and the more you do it the better you are at it. you know its taking up all your time, and you try to stop. but the game exits, and you stare at your desktop. a tear falls from your face as you hit play again. 10/10 would get addicted",640.1
"teamkill - ban on 7 days frequent vote on kick - ban on 7 days friendly fire, accidentally - ban on 7 days in, stupid systems ban good game!",44.5
"i meen iz ok its kind of a rip off of coutner strike source tho lol wtf valcve? getting lazy now that gaben has o much money",162.8
"competitive, fun, and a nice break from....shudder.....call of duty.",320.0
"overall a really good game, played it a lot and even got 3 buddys that normally doesnt play fps to like it.. but old fashion games that still prefer 1.5/.1.6 may think its been too smooth ad pretty. 10/10",121.1
">starts de_dust2:global offensive >opens case >wants asiimov >gaben gives us nova | sand dune >end 10/10 would never open a case again",288.6
"when counter strike: go came out it wasnt very good, and the online servers was quite dead. but after a year of updates the game have become really good! i knew valve and the team behind cs wouldnt let the cs fans down. counter strike go offers different gamemodes, improved graphics and overall options, a ranking system for those interested and a good variety of maps and weapons! the competitive scene have grown, and i think thats great. unlike some other fps, cs requires skill and training. when the game came out you couldnt customize the weapons very much, but now thats possible, with thousands of badass looking skins and stuff. cs:go is really cheap compared to most competitors, so im recommending it without doubt.",202.5
"comparing with cs:source,we can no more spray erotic pictures in game. instead,we have splendid weapon skins. if you become the last survivor of your team,dont be nervous,even facing 5.just gently press your fade f,then you can guarantee everyone on your side is watching you showing off your sparkling invaluable knife. theres no noob in the world,just elegantly push your likeable f,then everything is alright. in order to keep youself brilliant,you would buy as many cases and keys as you can afford. if you dont have so much money,work for it.if you dont have so much time to work,go rob a bank. if you finally got arrested,at least you had tried your best to chase your dream and guard your faith. go f()()() the game,and just admire your collection. enjoy yourself in counter-strike:skinner box. 10/10 /would touch f again and again",431.5
"communication 10/10 rage 10/10 calling someone as hacker 10/10 crying 10/10 lovely competitive teams 10/10 i cant find anything to say.... best mmorpg i ever played 11/10",707.9
"i love counter strike but actually theyre too many hackers on competitive. special holiday offers ruined this game too, hackers just buy new copies and create new accounts. you can play competitive till rank gold nova master, its just a hacker party after this. please valve, invest some money for a new anti cheat.",1422.0
"best game ever 10/10 youre either a hacker or a noob.",519.1
"the best program for learning russian at this price on the market!",1084.2
"you can buy cosmetic gun skins for $2500-5000, thus going bankrupt in the process. 11/10 would bankrupt again.",616.8
"what i love from this game is the fact that a single player, a weapon, a simple strategy can affect a whole round, it makes the game so unexpected and fun. plus it have funny physics.",893.3
"this game is ing dank as  m8 if you get it ill give you a dongar bill",1040.4
"cs:go is a game which was once designed around team-based attacks and defenses, something which has since been replaced by weapon reskins and recoil patterns. pros: very easy to hop into a casual game and enjoy a quick game. very easy to join a competitive game and work with a team of nearly equal skill-levels in a longer game with higher tensions. new game modes to choose from. wide variety of powerful weapons at your disposal. betting scene. numerous competitive leagues and teams for highly skilled players. cons: difficult to master weapons and recoil patterns. luck plays a considerable role in fights. learn a plethora of new insults from teammates. conclusion: for 15$, its worth every penny.",698.9
"counter strike: global offensive is a great game about robbing banks. it shows how a great musical game like itself can be transformed into something of a story driven racing game. it shows a few hints of real time strategy and can be played while eating foods such as pizza, spaghetti and vegemite sandwitches. overall i believe this dungeon crawler indie game should be given and 13/74. cartons of lemons.",817.7
"counter strike global offensive is a beautiful addition to the counter strike series it being the forth one to be made i believe valve have done a wonderful job but this isnt why im giving this game 10/10 its because you can also kill chickens for points in deathmatch 10/10 :d by far my favourite game in the series",1205.1
"rosetta stone, im using this as my russian teacher.",710.9
"started playing cs go because i could earn money by cases and mission drops to buy other games, but then i got hooked. once you play a while and know how the recoil, tactics and maps work, you will have a lot of fun playing competitive and other modes. whats better then play a game you love and get free money to buy other games.",1061.3
"really good game,from the beginning this i a game where you play 5 on 5 in teams against each other. it begins as an fps game but the more you play it you realize that it is a strategy game. a game in which both reflexes, strategy and teamwork.",1131.5
"do i like this game? yes. can i reccomend it? no. its too hard to get into. most new players will not gravitate towards the competitive scene, despite its the place where people should start, strangely. its just not a good game to start.",56.7
"engine still broken after idk how long. stopped playing when the buggy as hell css was released try to get back into it but the registry and .netcode in this version of the game is still so awful that its nearly unplayable. the community consists of die-hard try-hards and people who havent the slightest clue as to what they are doing. ranks are useless and baseless as it falls under a w/l ratio, rather than a k/d ratio like its forefather cal. with this release valve continues to make money off of other peoples ideas with stupid things like gun skins and lacks the originality it once had with its release of hl1 and 2. all in all this game is a huge waste of money and does not give anything to the modding community that once made this game thrive. forgetting the average age of a gamer and turning its back on the people that made cs a once world renouned title.",1661.7

"dear santa, for christmas, i would like for cs:go to receive an ai overhaul. you see, when i play a game, and a teammate gets grumpy, they wind up leaving. that leaves me and my friends with a bot. this bot is not very bright and will often run out into anything, whether it be a smoke, an incendiary grenade, an awp, or a five man rush of p90s and tec-9s. at the very least, i would love for the ai to be able to sit down in a corner as though it were a chick hatching an egg everytime it was asked to stay here team. sincerely kim jung-un p.s. ive been very good at using my cs:go betting money to feed the people of north korea. it makes up 30% of our gdp.",202.9

"i am going to give a few pros and cons.. pros -really fun to play with friends, who has mics, who you make a full team of 5 in competeive -you can meet really nice people in game -this game will still be alive for many years to come -game is really hard to master. why is that good you might ask? cause you will keep playing this game for many hours just to get the basics down. cons -there is trollers/mean crude people in the game, who are far better than you. -hackers (this is a big one later in the game of competeive play) you will come across them very often in high skilled level games. -complainers who just gives you complete negetivity in the game. like wow how the  did you not get the kill you ing scrub? -csgo skins (yes i have csgo skins blahaha) i am going to go with a postive review on this as a like. this is the type of a game i really like.

"always been a counter-strike fan, played them all and this is my favorite one by so far and this brought me back to the series after a long break. absolutely love the competetive matchmaking to find players to almost equal skill level as you and the feature to party up with your friends and play a game (casual or competetive) with them. and the new game modes are also fun and the fact that you can search official cs servers and the community made ones. the game is good, but they need to buff the shotties a little bit (except the mag-7) cause im tired of getting 80-98 damage point blank (espacially with the nova)! shotties are made to kill with one shot or medium damage with fast followup shots. :c (okay rant part is over) summary: i love this game alrdy even tho only 70 hours in the bank, but it has its problems like every game out there. if you like fps games and/or counter-strike give this game a try and be brave and try out the competetive matchmaking too! :3",714.3

"this is a super awesome and fun game that reminds me of cod: modern warfare(better known as cod4). anyone who has been playing fpss for years will understand what i am saying, and generally everyone agrees that cod4 was one of the best franchise fps games ever developed. while i dont think cs:go is on the cod4 level, it certainly does have that feel to it, and thats what draws me towards this game. the feeling i get from this game is one of simplicity and functionality; something too many game corporations out there continue to skip right past. all they want to do is make these crazy fps games with all these unnecessary gadgets and killstreaks and tons of other crap, when in reality, all the game community wants is a simple, stable, fun, and hardcore matchmaking powerhouse. for me, cs:go hits all of the high points, while only hitting maybe one or two of the low points. get this game.",562.1

"this game is so fun to play if youve played css (counter strike source) then you will love cs:go with the awesome graphics which make the game fun and the slight realism towards the game by contrast, cs is totally egalitarian. everyone has access to the same items, and players arent ranked. nobody cares if you play four hours a day, seven days a week. all that matters is how well you negotiate the next firefight. you might take out half of the enemy team... but then again, a much less skilled player might blind you with a flashbang grenade and unload his top-of-the-line shotgun into your skull. its not unusual to see a good player climb to the top of the scoreboard only to decline back into mediocrity. in cs, skill and alertness are your primary weaponsand when you get tired, there are no unlockables to help you keep your edge.",131.7

"hey, i am just curious if anyone else does this. every day when i take a shower, i like to turn the water super hot, hold my nuts in my hand and let the scalding hot water run over them. lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason, so instead of itching them, i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation ive ever felt in my life. it feels amazing and im doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. i just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. as ive been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working. i know its weird but im telling you it feels incredible. im not saying other people should try it, but if youve got an itch, perhaps a better alternative is to burn them with scalding hot water. posted: 19 april 2014",859.8

"currently the best competitive fps indeed ! it is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning, but with some practice, you should get the mechanics of the game. the strong point is that valve publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the esport with esport cases, team sticker or event cashprize (esl one, dreamhack). valve is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the operation/season pass like operation breakout or operation phoenix, so you can play community map in competitive mode ! the weak point imo, is the community, youre a noob, ou youre a cheater. furthermore, there are many cheater when the game is cheap on steam, but these low prices are usually followed by many vac ban... this game does not look like other games as the call of duty saga (this game is for child and noob) and they want to make money, cs:go is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community ! gl & hf ! thanks volvo :d",1524.8

(too bad i cant play most multiplayer games anymore since i moved. the internet here is crap)",156.7
"counter-strike: global offensive raises the bar for tactical first person shooters. this game is finely tuned and balanced not only in gameplay but with map design as well, to create an even fight for both teams. this pushes players to not simply hope for lucky shots and instead think more strategically about their every move. the introduction of weapon skins gives people a cosmetic incentive to strive for, as there are different weapon skins to fit the individual style of every player. this combination of pristine gameplay and in-game economy makes this one of my favorite first person shooters to date and it will likely never be overshadowed by another.",843.0

"counter strike global offensive has a perfect mix of casual and competetive gaming. if you are just starting out on the game you can play modes such as deathmatch, demolition and arms race before jumping in to competetive. competetive is the perfect way to prove yourself as a good player as you will be placed in to games based on your competetive rank which is good for new-comers to the game. i personally enjoy the competetive aspect of the game over casual although i have noticed a few faults with in the matchmaking system. sometimes somebody who is a low level gold (such as myself) you are sometimes placed in to a game with the top level golds or sometimes even master guardians. this could be because the mgs are playing with their lower leveled friends or it may be the system trying to test your level for promotion. i would give this game a 8/10 and recommed it to anybody who hasnt tried it.",1408.1

"one of my favorite games, i play it every day. one of the only fps i like at the moment. its really fair, if you die its most likely your own fault and not by some cheap killstreak reward. love the competitive matchmaking. it also has dedicated servers with most of the mods from source. if you like cs it is a must buy. if you are not really good at shooters it can be fun to play arms race, deathmatch and other random custom gamemodes. can be really hard to get into though, but the game has ranks that will match you with opponents with the same skill level. if you put some time on it you will improve quickly :)",1681.6

"one of my favorite games, i play it every day. one of the only fps i like at the moment. its really fair, if you die its most likely your own fault and not by some cheap killstreak reward. love the competitive matchmaking. it also has dedicated servers with most of the mods from source. if you like cs it is a must buy. if you are not really good at shooters it can be fun to play arms race, deathmatch and other random custom gamemodes. can be really hard to get into though, but the game has ranks that will match you with opponents with the same skill level. if you put some time on it you will improve quickly :)",1681.6

"quite a fun game, has its ups and downs but i think its more of a good game than a bad game. first of all, the game is very tactical and is filled with alot of different ways to play, but the most important part in the game is teamwork. the game is best played when you have a couple of friends with microphones. the competitive system in the game is quite fun. matchmaking isnt terrible, no netcode problems, and really i have nothing bad to say except for the community. the community of the game isnt harsh, but sometimes you may meet with some people which will be a little y throughout the game and may ruin your whole multiplayer experience. overall, the game is wonderful and amazing, i personally enjoy it and recommend it to those fps game lovers, though be wary that the aim in this game is nowhere like any other game, you dont have recoil but the ammount of bullet spray may get a little too much when you spray you gun rather than burst firing. brilliant game, great competition, tactical online experience.",256.6

"lets start off by saying this game is the best one in the cs series. id say that cs:go is a remade version of 1.6, which suits the needs of the current generation - better graphics, stuff is fancy. there is also this gambling aspect of opening cases and betting skins. i really do not know if i like it or not. some kids get happy over their new stuff when the other kids are crying after losing their whole skin collection in one click. now, the game itself. theres a new mode called competitive. people take this rather seriously. you can play it to get higher in rank - in case youve got what it needs to get there, which means youll get better opponents when you advance. remember that you have to be on the same (or higher!) level as your opponents to get higher. you can also play it to realize you belong to the bottom floor. but being on the bottom floor is okay, right? you can only get better.",706.7
"of course cs:go also has the classic server browser, wherein you can browse the servers, search them by tags/maps/player count/ping, regular stuff. some of these servers also feature funmodes, which you can play when you feel like playing cs:go but you cba to tryhard. most of those servers are noob-friendly. this game gets constant updates, which means tweaks to guns if some are deemed overpowered or underpowered, new skins, new operations, new maps, and more. be sure to have your credit card ready when these things happen, though!",357.1

"counter strike global offensive is the newest counter strike game out there, cs:go uses the same engine portal 2 ran on (which is a source engine but modified a bit) anyways cs:go is a counter terrorism / terrorism game where you can play as counter terrorists or terrorists, there are currently 4 official game modes ranging from competitive, casual and so and so. did i mention competitive? if so cs:go has a big competitive group (like every other counter strike game) the game also has community made maps and gun skins, so if youre good at skinning or map making you could possibly try out and put your skin / map on the workshop for this game, at the end of the day, counter strike global offensive is a must buy when on sale, and even when its off sale, you should save up some money or just buy it.",95.4

"this game is very hard on new players who want to play competetive. congradulations! you were just put against a team of all golds and you havent even won 10 games yet! even better, your team mates will mock you for not being good at the game. whats that? you want to play with players your own skill? to bad! with our match making system you will feel like  and never get to ten wins unless you have 30 loses! and your team mates will remind you it is your fault! who the  am i kidding though right? no one is going to read this and think i tried my hardest. i have 57 hours in the game and havent even reached ten wins competetive yet because i am being paired against people who are all gold. thanks for the great match making system, now where is my gibus for this game so that people know not to yell at me and just accept that i am new?",74.4

"well, this game has some pluses & minuses im going to mention below: pluses: + very competitive & challenging online game for shooter lovers; + big variety of weapons; + got lots of weapon skins which you can trade/sell; + additional missions which gives you rewards after completion; minuses: - only few weapons have aiming/zooming availability; - damage system is bad (you can empty whole magazine to an opponent on the chest & he still may stay alive); - graphics aint that good for 2012; - very strict rules in competitive mode (especially leaving the match penalty. it gonna give you cooldown even if you get disconnected from the game due to error & you cant fix it in 3 minutes. cooldowns may be from 30 minutes to 7 days); all in all, i dont see other alternatives of this game in this genre & despite all its minuses i mentioned above, it still remains one of the most played game in my list.",687.0

"a fun game that is meant for people who like shooting and strategy. this is more fun to play with friends , rather than alone, but can also be played that way. it requires high reflexes and precision , aswell as prediction and team play. multiple game modes make it fun, but i feel like the number of official maps could be bigger. the competative addition is realy good, as it allows you to match aginst your level of opponents and display your level of skill. there isnt a lot of weapons, but the current amount is ok. for each weapon you have to learn how to play with it (the recoil, bullets and other factors) so it takes time to master each one. the skin system is very fun and if you have some money in your pocket, you can open some crates and get cool skins to show off to your friends. overall this game is pretty fun and defintaly worth your money, if you like these kinds of games.",267.6

(bring back the mp5 or have it replace the mp7). overall, counter strike global offensive recives (for me) a 8/10. score: 8/10 pros: -new guns -better graphics -new gameplay modes -customization cons: -recoil is hard to get use to",142.7

"counter strike: global offensive, is, in my opinion, one of the most competitive games ever. the weapons are pretty well balanced, so, dont think that by using a certain weapon you have an advantage against your opponent. in order to win, you need to have skill, and cooperate with your team. although not for everyone. this game isnt a piece of cake. even if you say that you are very good at call of duty (for example), you will die a lot.",369.0

"one of the finest lan games ive played. expertly crafted and refined and far more accessible to new players than previous incarnations. the new demolition mode is quick and intense, with smaller maps sporting just one bomb site while plenty of varied cover guarantees exciting firefights. this mode is excellent for new players as everyone is given full armour and a gun at the beginning of each round (starting with the ak/m4). if you get a kill, next round you get a different, typically less versatile, gun for the next round (with grenades being awarded for multiple kills). this auto balances teams excellently as the most effective players have the worse guns while the new players spend longer with the easier ones. theres the added bonus that when playing with bots, you can take control of them when youre out. all in all, this is the finest cs there is. with smoother, more varied gameplay, better sound and graphics, and a wealth of high quality, free content in the steam workshop. worth every penny.",100.1

"i have really enjoyed this game - its one of the best games that i have played. allthough there are some bugs after major updates, valve always fix these. best of all, they listen to the comunity. map changes have been put in place because we wanted it. there is a massive comunity surrounding this game - because it is an e-sport, there are international competions held regulary and it offers great youtube content aswell as amazing twitch live streams. the gameplay itself is epic. i play competetive and it is so tense, the small teams and limited time make it a fast paced, action packed game. if you play with a group of friends or even random people who have microphones, it can become very tactical. there are a few bugs with the matchmaking system, and the low-budget servers can glitch and not register your hits which can be fustrating at times. i would give this game a 9/10.",609.9

"counter-strike: global offensive is a first person shooter game that takes immense skill, which i do not have. however even if you are a terrible player, cs: go allows you to still call other players noob or pleb. this is what makes cs: go a magnificent work of art. however, you cannot slay donkeys with swords (though you can slay chickens with knives).",704.1

"as someone who has played years of the call of duty and battlefield franchises, ive really grown to like this game. it has the usual fps feel, but of course the physics take some time to get used to when switching from other similar games. there is a lot more team work required, especially when playing competative, a game format which becomes addictive. everyone is going to like different games for different reasons, but for a game that is a quarter of the price of mainstream commercial products, this is where ive been spending my time.",272.1

"a brillant fast paced action game. this is a new update of counter strike source. the graphics look much better and smoother with some extra added touches. i really like the idea of crates and loot drops much like team fortress 2 i am able to customise my own gun skin and also player. the idea of counter strike global offensive is you are either on the counter terrorist team or the terrorist team. the counter terrorists must either save a hostage or deactivate a bomb whilst killing the enemy terrorist team along the way. the terrorists job is to hold a hostage or detonate a bomb whilst preventing the counter terrorists from doing the opposite. i think this game like team fortress 2 is a marvel of multiplayer fps and i would reccomend it to anyone young or old.",64.2

"having seen the evolution of this title from beta 1.6 into its current iteration, i have to say im very pleasantly suprised at how its evolved. the game has retained all of it original charm, and benefitted greatly from the addition of weapon skins and models. its a cult classic any fpser should experience.",70.7

"this game is great, although its really hard to get into. if you come in expecting anything similar to cod or battlefield, prepare to get completely wrecked. at the end of the day, if you want to play competetively, its all about map knowledge, strategy, and teamwork, with some skill at shooting here and there. if you want to run and gun like a maniac, you will not have a good time, but thats why i like this game.",393.8

"still, one of the finest fps pc games out there. this newest edition builds on the legacy of what is cs and includes a whole lot more. you can still play the usual competitive games but it can organise these for you instead of searching #irc for days or trying to plan a match via a game league. it also has some fun game types such as deathmatch, demolition and much more. with the option to purchase operation bravo to play a few more maps and those that are still in beta testing its simply superb. valve also kindly provide some little holiday add ons to remind you what time of year it is when playing the game! of course it does not come without its draw backs. bullet reg isnt the best, there are still quite a few cheaters in game and you get the usual kiddie cs player who wants to whinge all game and grief but with a decent rest of the team these can simply be voted out. going for 2.99 in the 2013 holiday sale you would be an absolute fool not to buy it!",325.4

"despite the months of beta testing beforehand, my experience in the first month after launch has been ridden with annoying bugs and ctds. the gameplay is pretty smooth, the weapons feel solid, and the flow feels more realistic. there are still many elements that make this game cheesy as ever (just float up a ladder), but for 15 bucks you will still get some very fun gameplay (demolition is well balanced and enjoyable) and decent replay value as valve adds more maps and content. if i had paid 50 bucks for this i would be pretty upset, but for its cheap price tag i can live with the bugs and slow updates. recommended.",547.1
"seems decent for casual gameplay. still long way before it is as goos as 1.6 on a competitive level.",1559.3

"counter strike: global offensive, or cs:go, is a fast paced shooter. most guns do not have a zoom feature so it isnt like call of duty if that is what you are wondering. you have to have a base understading in order to get really good. now that doesnt mean the game is not fun. there are many game mods for all types of players. they range from rescue the hostage, to plant the bomb, to your basic team deathmatch. there is also a competitive playlist if you are into that hardcore stuff as well. most of the maps are really well made and dont get old, if you do happen to get old of the standard maps then just buy the $3 map pack, or make a friend that has it since you can just join his lobby and play with em, that gives you this cool badge. this is a great game if you want something you can jump in and have fun.",795.1

"cs:go offers a competitive matchmaking feature - unlike cs:s and cs. this feature also includes a ranking system which i think makes it even more exciting and its a great way to easily find a match without having to use irc, etc. in addition theyve added molotov and decoy grenades, which i think is great even though i usually just go with the same old 2 flash, 1 nade, 1 smoke. through recent updates, they added weapon skins and stickers. it basically means that you get to play with dolls as a guy. i think its decent and it doesnt affect the gameplay in any way. if you were a fan of cs or cs:s, youll probably like this game. you just gotta get used to it. ive seen many people complain about it at first but they all ended up loving it anyway. so, basically, what im saying is; if you liked the previous counter-strike games, you should definitely try this out, too. i recommend it.",1243.4

"it has been more than ten years (released in 1999) since the counter-strike franchise took off. counter-strike was first released by valve on the microsoft windows platform in 2000. the game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the counter-strike series. as of august 2011, the counter-strike franchise has sold over 25 million units. this game has made professional gamers you see today. as valve released counter-strike: go (global offensive) the franchise even got more popular. earlier it was announced that counter-strike: go was the second most played valve game that they have ever made. amazing! that shows how many people play and love this great game. i really recommend this game",170.3

"as an ex call of duty player this game was more than an average change in tone from your regular fps. despite not having jaw dropping graphical fidelity and advanced texture tessalation like some of the next gen games do, and not having as many features as other aaa fps games do. cs:go makes for a unique take and updated version of a mod-born fps franchise that exceeds quailty over quanity. while it may seem lacking in basic things that fps games have become accustomed to like leveling up, you quickly begin to appriciate that go is a game that wants to stand out as something different. every different feature gives go an inch and when you start to add those features and differences together you start to find that cs is slowly taking over the fps stage. 1 inch at at time. for all time fps fans this game will keep you playing until you look at your watch thinking what felt like an hour, turned into six. thats the mark of a great game. personal rating (my oppinion): 9/10",49.5

"im just going to make this simple i played this game back when it was 1.5 i played 1.6 source then this for a little bit. but all in all the upgrades are fun the skins are addicting to collect. game all around has been improved if your a old school try this new school version out it will suck at first you will just keep dieing but all in all kicks  give it a go you will have that old competitve feeling back. random drops at the end of the game also :d..........",1028.6

"in 2002, i played a few games of cs 1.6, which has started and since been remembered as the best fps ive ever played. (other than perfect dark, golden eye etc, thats a different topic.) then cs:s came along, which i will proudly say today is the best fps on steam currently. to counter what others say about it, yeah it has flaws. what game doesnt? anyways, cs:go used to be a highly despised game when it came out, and like every game it had issues. i think that most, if not some or all major issues with the game have been ruled out already. despite a slightly growwing community of hackers in higher ranks, (a problem that all and i mean all games will have,) which i am not sure can ever be fixxed once it appears. (kind of like arma 2.) i recommend this game not because of a biased opinion, but because it is the only fps that i can play and actually enjoy it. sometimes you get matched with people with a lower rank, or dont know the map, but hey, youre that guy sometimes as well. 90/100, that deagle update.",195.1

"awesome fps game to play with your friends online. pieces of the counter-strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of global offensive is timeless. teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. theres an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because theres a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. call of duty and battlefield vets will wonder why they cant sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; counter-strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.",1094.9

"when a friend told me there was a game that let players re-enact the well-known modern skirmishes of dust 2, nuke and vertigo, i couldnt believe any game developer would have the audacity to create such turbulent moments in contemporary political history. valves counter strike: global offensive allows people to play through the scenarios the real counter-terrorism squads had to operate in and, for me, it has really been an eye opener. id recommend this game to any person whos studying a course based on inter-pol or counter-insurgency history as well as to those who are just into realistic shooter sims. re-live the intense close-quarter engagements that our trained elites had to go through!",173.9
"a very good game you. recommnded for fans of it all, ok",101.7
"by far the best counter strike game yet! this game is possible the greatest multiplayer shooter ever created. the game makes you rely on only your skills and knowledge of the game, no levels or upgrading guns. just you and your gun, the same guns your enemy has. this makes for a brutally difficult yet fun multiplayer game to play.",350.4
"whats so amazing with cs is that it has now been around for 14 years! and its still stong and will probably keep being strong for the next decade as well. its such a simple concept. 2 teams, one team defend the bombsite another attack it. its amazing how thrilling it can be to play and watch cs. cs:go is definitly the new fresh air that the cs franchice needs. the graphics are better, competitive play, official skins etc. there is only improvment coming from valve and itll probably become even a better game as the years go by. its a great game and if you like the previous or any cs games i strongly suggest you pick this game up! 10/10",505.1

"counter-strike: global offensive is an incredible game. it incorporates many things that made counter-strike: source and the orignal good, as well as delivering a new experience. now, im no professional, but i like this game. granted, there is a learning curve involved, and you will be killed quite often. but if you get over this, you will enjoy the game. they added a few new weapons, like the incendiary grenade and modified some maps to give a new experience. new game modes, like arms race which is basically gungame, were added to stretch out to more audiences. i would definately recommend this game to anyone that appreciates the genre.",415.1
"after playing over 190 hours of this game i suppose id better give a review for it. the gameplay of this game is extraordinary - the whole game is, like all counter-strike games, completely multi-player, meaning that the valve team can spend 100% of their time working on the game and making it run fine, instead of faffing around with a single-player campaign 5% of players will bother to play past the first level. the community, however... its terrible. but if you just realise that this is a $15us game, dont really take any offense to the little kids, theyre everywhere (but more so on call of duty). to summarize, this games excellent, buy it. now.",657.5

"one of the finest lan games ive played. expertly crafted and refined and far more accessible to new players than previous incarnations. the new demolition mode is quick and intense, with smaller maps sporting just one bomb site while plenty of varied cover guarantees exciting firefights. this mode is excellent for new players as everyone is given full armour and a gun at the beginning of each round (starting with the ak/m4). if you get a kill, next round you get a different, typically less versatile, gun for the next round (with grenades being awarded for multiple kills). this auto balances teams excellently as the most effective players have the worse guns while the new players spend longer with the easier ones. theres the added bonus that when playing with bots, you can take control of them when youre out. all in all, this is the finest cs there is. with smoother, more varied gameplay, better sound and graphics, and a wealth of high quality, free content in the steam workshop. worth every penny.",100.1

"counter-strike: global offensive is the best game to buy on steam atm. it has everything that you would want from a game: no pay2win! ofcourse you can buy things but those things give no advantages. like skins. the awp asiimov doesnt give you +100% rate of fire or something, its only for a decoration. cs:go is right now my second most played game on steam. this game is super fun but it does have some problems, like the 64 tick servers! 64 tick servers are mostly valve servers. sometimes you hit the dude 30 times and only does about 19 dmg. not spraying. thats why you should play on community servers like altpug, faceit or something. not esea. but if you want to pay for a company to mine bitcoins with your graphics card go ahead! have fun! otherwise the game is perfect. 10/10 recommend buying on a sale. not for the full price ;d if you buy it on a sale then buy some keys and crates and try to get a knife. :d i also reccomend watching warowls videos on how to improve. helped me a lot!",1412.5

"this game, unlike most fps games now, actually requires skill and coordination to win. you and your team have to work together to acheive a common objective in a series of fun maps that encourage both close and long range fire-fights. i would highly recommend this game to everyone who is willing to pay for it.",17.5

"as an ex call of duty player this game was more than an average change in tone from your regular fps. despite not having jaw dropping graphical fidelity and advanced texture tessalation like some of the next gen games do, and not having as many features as other aaa fps games do. cs:go makes for a unique take and updated version of a mod-born fps franchise that exceeds quailty over quanity. while it may seem lacking in basic things that fps games have become accustomed to like leveling up, you quickly begin to appriciate that go is a game that wants to stand out as something different. every different feature gives go an inch and when you start to add those features and differences together you start to find that cs is slowly taking over the fps stage. 1 inch at at time. for all time fps fans this game will keep you playing until you look at your watch thinking what felt like an hour, turned into six. thats the mark of a great game. personal rating (my oppinion): 9/10",49.5

(kind of like arma 2.) i recommend this game not because of a biased opinion, but because it is the only fps that i can play and actually enjoy it. sometimes you get matched with people with a lower rank, or dont know the map, but hey, youre that guy sometimes as well. 90/100, that deagle update.",195.1

"counter-strike: global offensive delivers something rarely seen in modern shooters. it brings us back to a time of simpler multiplayer action. in this war, you dont need to call in screaming jets, there are no pointless tchotchkes to unlock, and a stray bullet could mean plotting your revenge for minutes rather than seconds. modern shooters do their job well, but counter-strike is the series that helped build the scene. at 1o euros, global offensive is a great extension to that legacy.",119.8

"best counter-strike yet. at first, like most players i was skeptical on how valve would be able to take source and amplify that even more while bringing back certain portions of cs 1.6 that we all came to know and love and yet, they did it. cs:go has so many different game options and makes it a great game to play with a group of friends or alone. the weapon skins are a fun addition to cs along with stickers and other options. valve has created a game that allows players to play the cs theyve always known and loved, but continue to see new things within the game itself like operation breakout and new maps/weapons from the steam workshop. cs:go gets a 10/10 from me for sure.",799.9

"this game... just *speechless* i highly recommend this game to gamers who tend to have a liking in fps games. just a quick tip, 90% of your call of duty skills will go to waste as you venture through this amazing game counterstrike global offensive requires a person with precision, fast reactions and also superficial hand co-ordination is essential. with a vast majority of guns, selections are endless, each with different skills needed. love trading? cs:go is very similar to team fortress 2 as a large majority of their gamers trade. skins, guns and knives are a must have due to their sexiness competition allows gamers to showoff their skills (awping, headshots etc), letting use their planning skills and applying them online with other people around the world overall, counter strike global offensive is a game where many gamers would enjoy, no matter who they are. its fun, fast paced and most importantly, it never gets boring!",648.3
"great game. just started it, love it. but still, there are better games imo.",16.4
"a really big step from cs 1,6 and people are still playing it a lot. the reason probably being that the game never gets old if you learn. this is an anti-game (the more you play at once the more addicted you get). it is an open world first person shooter that doesnt allow you to respawn when you die. the way its meant to be played - 5v5 you have to buy weapons and kill the enemy team or complete the objective. since this is an open world game you can go wherever you like and kill whoever you like (yes friendly fire is on). good game, could be better if the matchmaking would be more balanced.",346.7

"counter-strike: global offensive (csgo), in a nutshell, is a fun fps with an awesome community. sure the gameplay is different than other fpss, but thats because valve listens to their customers. counter-strike has been around for a long time, and its gameplay has barely changed since it was released. games like call of duty and battlefield are constantly changing, so what happens is they loose their old fans, and gain new ones. counter-strike has always kept their gameplay remotely the same, so they keep their old players, and gain some new ones. for example, in call of duty you aim down your sights in order to be more accurate, in counter-strike, you crouch. yes i know aiming down your sights makes more sense, but valve doesnt care, because they know that their players dont care. i know this was a short review, and i focused more on gameplay than anything, but if you are into fpss, put this game on your wishlist and buy it when its on sale. you wont regret it, valve knows what theyre doing.",339.8

"this is one of the greatest competitive games of all time, definetly the best competitive fps. this game is an amazing amount of fun if you started playing in source(in which case you probably own this already) or if your a new player like i was. first of all it is great to see you and your friends skill develop as you get higher up the ranks, and you can sill have a good evenly matched game if you are in the lower ranks. second of all the community of this game is pretty much endless and that means there are always new maps coming out and hundreds of custom gamemodes. this game really diferentiates from other games on the market right now with its learning curve and skill cap. if you dont own this game you are doing yourself a diservice and for 12 or $15 this game is a complete steal for the amount of hours you can put into it. :)",67.1

"this game is great, it is so pleasing to note that valve has given such a contribution to the face of modern fps games. it has great core gameplay that is quick and flows into itself swiftly and easily. at least if a ct isnt camping a point with an awp, but thats besides the point. i havent played much, but what i have seen tells me that this game is engaging, fast paced and (without trying to make it sound like the most important thing ever) has some of the best graphics i have seen valve produce. also, are we rushin in? or are we going all sneaky beaky like? only negative i can really see is the scalding you get from people better than you if you go in competitive too early. this can be a drag for me, as i am merely a begginer, but the one liners the teams give and they gameplay earns this game, to me, a 7/10. now of course, as i play more i will most likely learn to like the game more! lets hope i do! also russians.",105.1

"if you enjoy a game with players that do not see the sunlight, this is a game for you. i personally dont understand why aiming wasnt implemented.the aiming makes no sense whatsoever. whoever designed weapons were their bullets would continuously either hit the ground or fly to jesus, should be hung. this is a real weapon shooters nightmare, a bunch of little screaming boys spraying their weapon to all , and the hardcore sniper using mlg players, is attrocious. the amount of time players have on this game is concerning. upwards of 1500 hours is scary. the best way to waste $15 is to buy this game. i would much rather eat $15 than have bought this game. i just plain dont understand the point of this game. also, who the  would want to be a terrorist anyway? 1/10",55.9
"csgo is amazing for a lot of reasons.. community workshop.. skins and being able to play with the same rank as yourself! im personally a t person but csgo has so many features like servers! they block/ban players for cheating which is amazing. so are you still wondering why you should get csgo? well theres chickens! anyways 10/10 must recommend",58.4

"one of the best games i have played. this is one of the first games i have played on my pc, ever since i joined steam. there are so many things to do to pass time in the game, such as surfing. competitive is one my favorite things about the game, it allows for team communication and co-ordination. also, opening cases have been the death of me, i have opened at least 50 of cases and nothing good, but that wontt stop me from opening them and getting the infamous butterfly knife. this game helped me get better at pc games as i was a cod player on console. this game will never get old, and ill never stop playing it. on the other hand, it does have problems in the community such as smurfs and hackers, but hopefully, they will try and remove this to keep the game fair. furthermore, this is the most played game i have on my library. i would definitely recommend this to anyone whether they are good at fps or starting on pc games. this game gets 10/10 on my book.",690.5

"counter strike: global offensive, or cs:go, is a fast paced shooter. most guns do not have a zoom feature so it isnt like call of duty if that is what you are wondering. you have to have a base understading in order to get really good. now that doesnt mean the game is not fun. there are many game mods for all types of players. they range from rescue the hostage, to plant the bomb, to your basic team deathmatch. there is also a competitive playlist if you are into that hardcore stuff as well. most of the maps are really well made and dont get old, if you do happen to get old of the standard maps then just buy the cheap map pack, or make a friend that has it since you can just join his lobby and play with em, that gives you this cool badge. this is a great game if you want something you can jump in and have fun.",91.9

"ahhh. what can i say about this game? well, a few things. first off, this game is one of the most skill required games out there. you practice, you play , you practice more, you play more. although its competitive matchmaking system is a bit, lets see, ed up, its such an addicting but yet rewarding when you get what you want. because this game has a massive competitive scene, along with a thriving trading market, it will be one of the most envigerating experiences of your gaming career - depending on what you like. i would reccomend this game to anyone i know, as this game is becoming my lively hood. anyways - buy this.",1130.4

"what amazes me about this game is the special ambience the player lives while playing the game consciously. its not just a random fps game thats about shooting the adversaries randomly, as it requires subliminal reactions and reflexes. the simplicity of the game makes the gamer focus more on the precision of his shots and actions than on the graphics (although the graphics are acceptable) and on the rest of the petty details. blatantly, the game was thoughtfully developed by the brave developers, who are still working on the game till nowadays, and are still considering the complaints of players and working on improving the gameplay to satisfy everybody. this game is a great successful accomplishment to the developers of valve. *proto tips the hat* overall: fascinating game.",902.3

"the trick to counterstrike is this, the guns dont work like guns should work. ive never been able to figure out if it was the way damage was dealt, or perhaps it was some other arbitrary calculation that determined your ability to kill the other guy, but whatever it was it gained sentience somewhere around cs 1.3 and has hated players ever since. its just now people are used to that malignant hatred and have learnt to use it to their advantage. a decent enough game, to be sure. but its in a different vein then your usual fps. lots of pros. lots of . lots of mlg gamers who are a mixture of the former two. if you havent had enough cs in your life, this might be for you. if not, just keep on walking, jack.",58.3

"id easily say counter-strike soure was an essential therefore making this game an essential to your steam library. if you havent got it, get it. never compare it to call of duty or any other fps, counter-strike is unique, skill-based and team-based (if you play 5v5). great game. community is great, players matchmaking is equal and not much you can complain about.. learn2aim!",100.3

"very bad matchmaking system. it is a great game when the match is balanced, however that is a rare occasion. it would be better if the game took the rank of all team members and averaged it out and used that rather than using the highest rank to find a match. if there was a way to rank it halfway i would do so. money can, however, be made in this game and quite a lot of it; however, it is a gamble every time you open a weapon case that usually results in loseing money rather than makeing it. the game itself is good, but the matchmaking system could use some work.",509.8

"if you somehow havent gotten csgo on one of its many sales, i believe you should. i think everyone should atleast try this game due to simplistic easy to learn, hard to master fps curve. unline many other genres of competetive gaming, you can see yourself and others become better players by just playing the game casually (no disrespect to the other competetive genres). by playing csgo youre almost guranteed to get better by just having fun! you dont even have to play competetivley either, just grab a few friends and hop into a gun game or casual playlist and mess around.",158.8

"where do i begin to describe this game. one of the best fps shooters ever! but on a serious note cs:go is a very tactical fps that requires a lot of skill to play as well as team work. when i first bought this game i would say i was a callofduty fanboy. and i at first when i started playing this game thought to myself, this game sucks! what a waste of $15! you cant even aim down the sites! these graphics suck! (#n00bstatus) but i decided hey i wasted money on this game so im going to try it out. after i won my first competitive match i was amazed! not because i did well, but because ive never really played a game as a team with other people. im used to playing a lot of tdm on cod and that requires no skill and no communication to your fellow team mates. at first ill admit i was a bit timid to speak to everyone else but when i started to, they actually listened. so to those new pc players thinking about getting this game i would reccomend this hell, not just to them but to everyone else as well.",821.0

"if you plan on playing cs:go, i would wait for it to go on sale solely because the game is almost always on sale for 75% off, but is still worth the full original price. if youre a source player expecting source 2.0 dont buy into it, its similar in ways but it is also its own game in way more. the game physics are different, quick scoping is different, you can jump scout. yes. you can jump straight standing still and shoot accurate with the scout. i bought the game for the comp play because scrims are a dying breed in source. its aggravating when you get an absolute garbage teamate that just trolls your game, but its a video game and thats expected. run-on sentence over. overall, great game.",606.1

"fundamentally a great fps game. the classic maps from source and 1.6 are still here, and have been nicely updated to look fantastic. competitive 5vs5 mode is very popular, and although there are issues with match-making and hackers, there is now retrospective rank editing, so if a game youre in contains a hacker, who is then banned, that loss will be wiped from your record and your rank will return! casual game modes are still fun, and there are a few great casual maps to play. one thing casual mode is lacking in a 5vs5 competitive practise mode, as currently its 10vs10 which is just chaos at times. apart from these flaws and the difficulty of the game itself which can be off-putting to newcomers, i would still massively recommend this game.",1403.5

"a decent successor to counter strike: source, but in my honest opinion i feel as if it doesnt live up to source, might be due to nostalgia. any way you should get this over source due to the shift of the competitive scene from source to go.",65.9

"as addictive as cs has always been, with matchmaking reducing the need for pickup/organisational 5on5 clan matches outside of sponsored leagues. any game that offers both matchmaking and dedicated servers is a winner in my book. this game encourages both community play and competitive, which is something many games fail to achieve in modern gaming. this game has built on its predecessors for the better and i cannot recommend it enough.",1211.3
"the fact that i am writing a review to convince anyone on the fence about this game is disconcerting. this is hands down my all-time favorite tactical shooter. there is little negative to say about this game besides the players who abuse it from time to time. the addition of overwatch and use of vac help to limit this, however. the competitive element about this game keeps me constantly on my toes and at the edge of my seat. the active developers address any bugs or issues with the game in a very timely manner. the inclusion of item drops have reinvigorated the game for myself as well, personalization=power. the use of the steam workshop for custom maps is also a plus for training or general enjoyment. only complaint is there are no scripted building destruction animations and that michael bay wasnt considered for explosions and boom effects. :)",1160.0

"if you need a nice change from run & gun call of duty or battlefield, perhaps you dont need a change at all. counter strike has maintained the same basic principles for over a decade. positioning is everything. both positioning on the map, and of your crosshair. while correct positioning on the map provides great advantages, the end-all factor is aiming. aiming not only guns, but grenades. a well placed grenade that barely fits in a crack and completely blinds the enemy team can be the deciding factor in a close game. it requires many hours of play to understand each facet of cs:go. many games are easy to learn and hard to master. cs:go is hard to learn and master. the challenge is what makes victory so much better.",474.3

(edit 02/07/14) three weeks after being banned, i would have expected the ban system to have taken my ban to 30 minutes, however it is a 7 day ban, dont believe the lies cs:go flows out. you ban does not roll back in any form, there is no point in buying this game if you play competitive.",123.9

"its a good game. its much harder to pick up than any other shooter because of its mechanics. this isnt really a bad thing, as youll get used to it eventually and it makes it even more fun to get kills (especially headshots) because of its difficulty. the community in this game isnt really the best, as most of the players playing in competetive are people who wont cooperate and russians. this makes it really heard to communicate with your team you might have been matched with in the competetive gamemode. so having somebody you know to play competetive with is much better and easier as teamwork is necessary for winning this game. other than that i must say that most weapons here are very well balanced because of how the money system works. if i would have the option to change one thing in this game it would be to make competetive (or just generally all valve servers) 128 tick, as it would make the game more based on how well you play and less on whos the most lucky in a gunfight.",1461.9

"this is more of a yes and no review. the game is ok to pass time, but it has a very scratched down sence of competiton. what i mean by that is this, each team only has a few different guns, the guns that do change are the same kind and have the same stats, and the same equipment for the most part. the only thing that changes is the skin of each gun, and that changes from player to player. it isnt very buggy and can run on basic computers without much lag or connection issues. the graphics are fair for its time but some guns are way to loud and some are very quiet. the only real problem i ever had with it is that after a while it gets very boring to play. i cant give this a bad score or a good one.",11.0
"when it comes down to it, its just plain fun. sure it might incite some rage a bit here and there, but it has become one of the few games that ill always come back to. if you like shooters and you see it on sale, id say its a must buy. the addition of gun skins is neat too.",323.1

(counter-source is my most played games by like 100 hours btw.) we were playing arms race and demolition and casual mode. arms race is stupid but so much fun. demolition is a fun quick version of defuse where you get new guns every time you kill someone. those stupid bots? well you can take over them if you die. very fun with friends, not great own your own but arms race is quite addicting and allows you to play on your own if you want. i like this game, source will always be my favourite shooter game, but this one is really good too.",50.1

"8/10 very well made, but its a cs game, so we all knew that. same general thing, but a little more catering to noobs in the addition of an official deathmatch mode and gun game-like game mode. but the ammount of sheer hate to some noobs who used to be pros but are now rusty is just ridiculos. ive seen one of my friends be one of the best in cs:s, then he comes to this, and then gets hated on. all in all, great game, shaky community edit: nevermind the community thing. most of the asshats seemed to have moved off of competitive matchmaking, so now people can practice in peace without the unfortunate  ruining our fun. also i would like to add this is the best competitive fps on the pc to date and it will probably stay until a new cs game appears or rainbow six siege comes out.",278.4
"counter-strike: global offensive, this is game is just counter strike with new skins and highly redesigned textures for the most part, as for many players, the game seems more easier and for some more harder. the game is 14.99 and is a good buy if your wanting to start counter strike, and i know, i know people are going to say get counter strike 1.6 or counter source. but depending on your budget and if your into good graphics, i guess get this then. this game is alright buy, jsut skins thats all your getting from it. im giving counter-strike: go a 7.5/10",9.0

"its an amazing competitive game with friendly players, as you get higher up the ranking the people get a bit more serious, but there still great to talk to. the only critisizme is the cool down system, where if you leave a competitive match you will recieve a 30 min, 24 hour or a 7 day ban, sometimes this is justified, but other times, for instance when you get timed out, and connot rejoin, and then recieve a 7 day ban. this has happned to me 4 times, all there fault. all in all a fantastic game though.",919.1

"counter strike: global offensive (otherwise known as cs:go) is the newest game in the counter strike series. since ive already done a review of counter strike: source, im just going to talk about the many gameplay changes that go introduces to the series. firstly, the guns all have more kick to them, making run-n-gun players hugely greivanced. the guns all feel authentic and sound amazing, but i personally dont enjoy using the snipers and i cant stand the heavy weapons (i.e. miniguns). the weight of each gun has been pretty drastically increased, leaving slower and more methodical gameplay in its path. if you remember cs:s, there a probably 2 things you noticed: 1. there were very few shotguns, and 2. there were only two grenade types. well, in go, there are now 5 types of shotgun, and 4 different types of grenades! i personally believe is the best game in the counter strike series, and its methodical gameplay makes for a difficult experience, for both newcomers, and seasoned veterans.",15.2

"this game is the first fps to me and the players have a lot of fun, too. i was not about graphics, i think the profits to buy a box to open. i think that may be a bit of a good thing. players are not stressed this game is stressful and non-stressful at the same time.  fps  1        ^^",7.1
"i really like this game. the banning system is a little bit harsh but other than that is excellent",421.8
"although it may looks different and enhanced,its almost exactly like cs 1.6 ! but thats a good thing,because it smoothens the transition from 1.6 to go. what i love the most,is the gathering/matchmaking system.you can always play elimination and not worry,that you might have to wait for an hour to get ingame. a great way to prepare for an actual tournament or battle! out 0f 10p scale,i give it a strong 8!",293.2

"hard to learn, impossible to master. this statement perfectly describes the learning curve of the counter-strike series. this is no different with cs:go. the latest installment in the counter-strike series boasts a serious competitive multiplayer, with a somewhat relaxing yet challenging offline play with ai. it also features various gamemodes like arms race (gun game) and deathmatch. along with the actual game, there is also a huge emphasis on the community. with the toolsets given by valve, users are able to create weapon skins and entire maps for submission on the workshop. i have seen truly amazing, creative and brilliant ideas come from the workshop. pros: - great multiplayer - awesome community integration - fantastic customisation of settings - relaxing offline mode with bots cons: - hard to learn. even harder to master. worth the $15. must have on sale.",384.2

"first, i thought it was a mistake buying this game bec i get dizzy easily and feel like throwing up. if you havent play fps(first-person shooter) before, youll get dizzy playing this one. the technique is take it slowly. bit by bit. until you can play for an hour straight.",131.8
"best counter-strike i have ever played! two thumbs up!",228.9
"cs:go is definitely a huge development from source. its more realistic than before and the weapons+maps are well updated, however it lost its dusty/grungy feel to it. i think it sort of gravitated towards the call of duty futuristic look and im glad that they kept their game style of waiting until either team won, its more realistic that way. i prefer source over go but i still recommend this game",117.1

"first of all the trailer was amazing and had great detail, by far the best trailer ive ever seen for a game. the gameplay is amazing and the only problem with this game is the community some people can be impolite but valve was smart and added a mute function, the only other problem i have with this game is the teamwork issues in competitive sometimes i get into games and the people are idiots other times they just dont listen! overall i would say 10/10 it is an amazing game",334.9
"this game. a veteran since cs 1.6s release many many years ago, and having an account (attached to this accounts profile, have a look if you need.) since valve said get this pls back then too, and playing many hours in that, and many many more in counter strike: source i knew that when this was announced, it wouldnt let me down. at the time im writing this, i know i bought this and played for 10 minutes when they released, and my hours are so low, thats because ive finally got back into the franchise of cs. amazing game. detail is beyond my standards, and the community is brilliant. (apart from the trolls here and there, but hey this is the internet.) 80 hours + and rising (at the time of writing this.) i recommend this game with all of my arm strength, waving at you with a fist full of money and screaming shut the hell up and buy this game already. its got many 10/10s from me already. but in total.... 12/10 would buy again.",296.1
"personaly, one of the best developed games created by valve.as you play deathmatch,casual,demolition,competetive,arms race, you earn ranks and learn how to become a cs go pro.but thats not all you can brose and take a look in the community based servers, which are sometimes recommended.(vac problems)(kinda). finnally you can buy 5 versions of counter strike for 29.99 wich is a huge amound of savings, because you get more for less. in conclusion this game supports many graphicvs cards. i mean i bought call of duty ghost and i cant even play it maybe tell the end of the month because it only supports graphic card with direct x 11. (ed till i get the money, well see if i like it more than cs go).",834.7

(aand of course you are not using any of them) waste hours killing virtual s as they are trying to do same to you. feel yourself as overpowered and skillful hitman as you finish the game as the one and only... n1!

"if you like competative cs:s, this is definitely for you. while the game isnt any battlefield 4, its still good. i personally give it a 7/10, its basically a huge graphical (and bullet-physics) improvement of cs:s. theres a few new gamemode improvements as well as fun trading and workshop items, as well as new guns. the t models all look the same and lack at least some noticeable variety, which is very unfortuante because you would think terrorists would have at least some distinguishable features. the ct all look the same which is expected from a swat team, so thats acceptable. originality is a low in cs:go but they preserved the cs:s-style gameplay that everybody loves, so it balances itself out. it is worth your money if you love cs:s, but if youre looking for something like cod or bf4, youre in the wrong place.",5.9

"this game is bliss, crisp and original, they keep real to its predocessor aswell as keep it clean and refreshing each time you play, this game wants me to play first person shooters more competitively and yet make me want to leave the brown shooter genre, of course, i would not consider this game a brown shooter as its incredibly clean, as i said earlier, the content and the fan base is incredibly friendly, unlike there competitors e.g call of duty, what i found difficult was playing this game casually as being strategic will keep you alive longer, being casual will make you suffer the consequences.. i feel the only downside is that the bots are a bit stupid from time to time and sometimes spawn camping is paramount for survival on servers, and sometimes will be spawn camped in such a hurrendous way, regardless, i would recommend this game to all people i know and dont know alike.",198.3

"its a good game but, there are way too many nerds on it, though. it makes the game annoying, when you have 4 losers screaming in your ear because you got killed by a guy you couldnt see. i would recommend this game to someone looking for a smart shooter, youre not superman, absorbing 1,000 bullets like in call of duty or battlefield, so you cant just run around everywhere and think youre going to kill everyone because you wont. verdict: good, overall - smart shooter, fun and fast paced action but, too many nerds/annoying people make the game almost unplayable, at times. i bought this game for $2.49 at a steam sale and i consider it worth that ammount of money, however, this game definitely is not worth paying full price, my advice, wait until the next steam sale to get this game.",5.4

"csgo has been the epitomy of a developer supported title and should set a precedent for many games in the future. valve has done an incredible job of not only listening to the community, but implementing good ideas on a respectable time table (an update was made less than 48 hours after a user suggestion with his improvement implemented in that update for example). csgo is a fun and addictive game with a high skill-ceiling, competitive community, crowd funded tournaments, and an addictive weapon skin system, that again - can be fueled and improved by the community. this is a must have title for the competitive minded gamer. the only negative that comes to mind regarding counter strike global offensive is the amount of cheaters at higher levels in competitive matchmaking. although valve has introducted both vac and overwatch, there is still little being done at the current moment, but im hopeful for a fix to be introduced soon.",692.8

"+ well. its a counter-strike game (that means its amazing). it looks better, than cs 1.6, and css. i really like the new assistance feature (i hate when you take someone 98 hp and than suddenly noob appears and kill him with the biggest crap gun that could be bought in that round at all), plus some new tactic equipment (as decoy grenade or molotov coctail) is quite refreshing. another great stuff is that you can watch official matches in the menu, and achievements are well written. some new guns. - on the other hand, this game still miss something i cant properly describe. lets just say i am having more fun when playing the good old cs 1.6 instead of this.",10.3
"at the start of 2011 i was introduced to css an awesome strategic game. valve sended a new game called counter strike global offensive. at the start i thought it was pretty ugly. but when i bought it, cs:go has changed my point of view, it is much more better than css. pros+ better graphics. more instense. realistic. the guns look nice. valve delivers more detailed maps. they even installed matchmaking!. new game modes. elegant skins. customizable settings . hud. valve develops community skins. recording of competitions. much much more! cons- hard for new people since people who play cs 1.6 or css will buy this game. alot of skins are expensive and are not really worth it. alot of unfriendly people! spray patterns conclusion this game is really good and valve was making it cheap because they wanted more people. not that much people are friendly but you can find really nice people like davey so bravey :> awping is alot easier. cs:go is the best game in the cs:go franchise. i would rate it a 9.5/10 :p",751.2

"a slightly better looking addition in the counterstrike series, it delievers its promise of new gamemodes and inovation and is literally the best built competitive multiplayer shooter on the market. along with multiple community servers full of fun game modes that bring a never ending amount of fun. and its 15$ what more to say.",228.7

"awsome game which brings me 10 years back but keeps the same fun!",74.5
"counter-terrorists are not, as one would expect from the name, terrorists who are excellent at math. this oversight has ruined the game for me, and im not sure if i can play it any more. de_dust also completely lacks any dust. 10/10 would play again.",18.6
"best game ever got another acc with 700 h never will finish playing this game gj vavle love you for good game like that",719.4
"this game is very good, it takes actual tactical skill while other shooters like cod are based on twitch gaming. but this game is very hard if you are new you will die and die in your first matches by people who have 5 years expirience. pros -good gameplay -very tactical -fun -the guns are cool and accurate to real life. cons -community is o.k. -not noob friendly",128.9

"im really bad at this 1/10 would not play(i play it anyways)",19.2
"great game overall, and i played a lot on just my first day. one more thing, if youre looking for a good, cheap alternative to cod with 1 hit knives, quickscoping, reallistic graphics, all that other popular stuff in it, then go ahead and do yourself a favor, find something else. either way, another thing is for all of those achievement hunters out there, go get this game. in just the first few days i played this game, i got a lot of achievements. there are tons of acheivments to get, and an achievment for almost any weapon i believe. another thing that i personally think is nice is the skins. you can get these by playing or buying them off the market, and you can make your own and upload it to the steam community, and if i remember correctly, if you get enough likes on your skin, then your skin can get put in the game. either way, great game, i recommend it to anyone (exept like i said before, people who are looking for a cheap alternative to cod).",155.5
"this game is really rewarding based on its skill oriented gameplay, and is recommended for players seeking a challenging game to get into, or seasoned players who have not yet upgraded from previous games. i dont know what im saying okay just buy it",258.7
"its a pretty awesome multiplayer game. basicaly there are 2 teams: counter terrorists(obviously), and the terrrist. you can choose from game missions like: hostage, search and destroy, and team deathmatch. also, you can customize your weapons with sets of camos. over all : 3.5 out of 5 stars",368.9
"only fun to play with bots. this game might as well go full out on realism by pernamentaly breaking your computer upon death by headshot.",10.8
"i havent played counter strike until now but i think it is worth the money. i reccomend it all fps fans, because it can be played causually or professionaly.",567.2
"very fun and addicting, i dont have much fps experience on the pc so this is definitely a big transition from console shooters. regardless, after learning the ropes this game becomes quite satisfying.",871.4
"absolutely amazing game of ups and downs, the thing im really reviewing is the classic competetive gamemode. this game mode is absolutely superb, although it causes me to be very angry sometimes, it also causes great self gratification when i win or even get a kill, it is a wonderful game and spend quite a lot of my time on it.",914.9

"transition from 1.6 to go was not waste for me...1.6 was and will be an amazing game, but then again we must accept the changes...i love cs go more than i loved 1.6 and this is no doubt one of the best fps games of the world. i spend hours playing, trading and having fun on this game...great work valve.",1245.9

"this is the best game currently on steam, if you havent got it, get it now while its on sale! this game is just so good. every aspect of the game is good but the learning curve is pretty steep so experience in other fps games wont matter , other than that . get it now!",513.4

"this game is super dope!! i love the classic counterstrike feel mixed with a new graphical perspective this game is perfect for fps lovers! there is a skill curve, but once you learn the counterstrike tactics, you are set! buy this game",431.2
"oh my god i love this game! its so much fun! i love playing with my friend tomoxv and we play a lot online. my favorite mode is the one like search and destroy (defuse). i love the way you buy things in the beginning. it does have a huge lack of realism in it though. you shoot someone, they fly across the map. i also hate the hackers on this game. it is very fun and i recommend it. if you need a score, counter-strike: global offensive gets a 8/10.",4.8

"i play many games but, this is one i keep coming back to. it has by far the most hours i have in a game, and the time i have put into this game is well worth it. its a must buy to anyone who want to play a real game.",735.4
"great game. its cs, so you know what to expect. quick matches. intense difficulty. high tension. some of the most classic fps moments in video gaming history. cs does not need to change, the formula is perfect and valve knows it. same great gameplay and style with great smooth graphics, highly recommend.",18.4
"fast paced shooter with high skill curve. fun and exciting.",1052.7
"although a great game and a great tranformation from its prequels it is not much fun to play here in india asindian servers are almost non existant. they do exists though, but their number is pretty low, and if you play on servers outside india you suffer with high pings. i wish cs go was as popular in indian audience as the previous series, but nevertheless its a great game! :)",6.0

"fun for anyone who like pretty much any valve game, combat style requires lots of skill and tactics but all fun in all.",101.5

"its always war but ppl dont realy die ;-). lets make warfare in the world like this and everybody will be happy....",1146.0
"its fun, its the counter-strike we all know and love, just reskinned with some new weapon models/maps/game modes and a few new surprises. its not meant to replace cs:s or 1.6, its aimed for the newbies and the casual crowd, but it can sustain the hardcore as well. tl:dr: same game, different box, worth more than $15, go get it.",90.7
"i have many feeling for this game, i love it but yet hate it. i will start off with the hates, one of the main things about this game are the prices of in-game items. such as keys for example. i personally think that these keys are way too much. really? $2.50 a piece? that crazy, now the cases, those are different story. cases are pretty decently even with price wise. 10 cents to around 50 cents at the max. but keys, its like paying for a gallon of a gas a key. now for the good side of what i think of this game. i love this first person shooter/ competive/team work game. its action packed, gets your heart pumping, and is alot of fun. but one thing i do wish valve does in the future is that they decrease the price of their items. its insane, my rating: 9/10",1089.6

"only the most competitive and skill based game on the market. you need some serious work if you want to become a professional cs player. great graphics. you need to think to play this game run strats to beat your enemies. the only thing in cs:go that i have a problem with is the map balence. every map is ct sided besides one map: de_dust 2.",648.9
"amazing game, i love it, especially the competative mode. i dont like deathmatch though, the random spawning is ridiculous. but other than that pretty good game over all",224.0

"counter strike: go is truly fantastic, not just in its graphics, physics and guns, but in its gameplay.a balanced cache of weapons to balanced teams in their own position, objective and weapons creates one of the most addictive shooters around.",429.7
"this is a good game. nice players and has realistic concepts implamented to make it a more fun experience. new skins, map and custom player made maps make the game so much fun!",546.5
"counter-strike: global offensive is a good first-person multiplayer shooter, with a more arcade-style gameplay. the graphics are good, though the textures are pixelated at times. it is extremely competitive and very addicting. edit: pixelated textures due to settings. 8/10 edit new score : 9/10",521.9
"smooth and very simple fps, with a lot of fun game modes. competitive mode lets you play the game like a team instead of going around like lone wolf. the ranking system make sure you never compete against much better opponents.",776.5

"shitiest game if you like cod this is the game you whant",151.8
"i thought after playing the first counter-strike this would be the same old methotical crazy overly mlgproquickshot kind of stuff that would flourish abundantly. however i was partially right, from the time ive been playing competatively and casually, i can clearly tell ya that it has a far better community than it used to. quite frankly, im rather shocked to say that im enjoying running around like a crazy guy and taking out people left and right like its nothing. you do need to forget some bad habits from other fps games but overall, its awesome.",88.4
"better than cs:s good graphisc more realistic maps now and lot of screaming russian kids",37.9
"a pretty decent fps shooter game that lives up to the counter-strike series. comes in a variety of gamemodes instead of your usual defusehostage missions. be prepared to play on either de_dust2; or de_inferno if you were to play defuse missions. sure there are plenty of de_ maps. unfortunately the community will most likely pick the aforementioned two. brace yourself to be ridiculously killed by an awp in pointblank range which put shotguns to shame. waiters with awp at the end of every aisle. pelted till death by p90s like nothing. and lets not forget, death by the weapon that requires utmost expertise. the gay gun. the terrorist team would most likely be stacked. but hey! you get skins. (or crates, but mostly crates) 7/10 - worthy of purchase if you enjoy a slice of fps.",1423.8
"i may change this later but lets get things straight really quick mac/linux users dont buy this, you will have constant crashing and an unplayable game pc users, this game is amazing the competitive aspect, most the community, everything about it.",1079.2
"okej...i like this game and its fun even for a noob that gets killed all the time and havent played much fps at all...but then again i still like it and hope to become better....only one thing that is wrong. why so serious ? getting kicked out couse you aint good enough...for those who do so...its a game !!! but if you can over see that...really fun game and f-them who are the kickers...",41.5

"best counter-strike game yet edit: so after a few more hours of playtime, this game is definitely an improvement of the previous counter-strike games. from the graphics to the maps (which includes maps from source and condition zero and possibly counter-strike) and the buy screen is now more in-depth and i die anyway, so if i try bomb defusals with bots, i jump into a bot and steal his weapon. another reason for recommending this game is that it has held really well since its first release in 2002. if youre buying a counter-strike game, i definitely recommend this one.",20.0

"my first love for fps. everything seems balanced compared to other fps out there.",206.8
"ever since the cs 1.6 was launched 13 years back, its amazing to se ehow they have near-perfected the game! counterstrike isnt about leveling up, or showing off your stats. its a game, that pushes us to learn to be better in the game! even though its not as forgiving as other fps when it comes to competitive play on servers, its still an amazing game! it provides people the platform to show of their talents in the workshop, allows us to customize how we want to play, while keeping the same level of difficulty for all players :) i would definately recommend playing this! :d",174.8
"game is nice, and ive earned my money back at least twice. 10/10.",327.0

"this game is like a crack addiction, you start slow and play a few games and get your first skins and cases and think, wow i could make money doing this, then its all downhill from there, soon youre paying for keys with paychecks, it adds up so fast. by the end of it all, in my case 680 hours, you have no money, your friends wonder where youve been, and gabe newell has actually installed himself on your computer. if you make it out, good for you, but it will keep you coming back for the new updates and cases, beware my friends. 11/10 would recomend",787.4

"the worst part is that you win money by playing the game and selling stuff into the market.",81.9
"the follow up to the legendary classic, cs:go is very similar yet feels distinctly different to counter strike source. anyone who enjoyed source should enjoy global offensive.",45.9
"the best fps online game i have ever played. for me it is better than cod and bf serials",822.4
"excellent game, that coming from an ex cod fanboy. i like the most the team effort to achieve victory, the communication, watching each other back and employment of some simple tactics. i really enjoy it.",1708.3

"love the game .. every addictive :d also spend so much money on crates wheres my knife!. try it out",154.4
"counter-strike: global offensive is a very good multiplayer game. its based on shooting, tactics and teamwork to defuse a bomb or save a hostage. the are different gamemodes. my favorite gamemode is competive matchmaking. actually cs:go is a nice online shooter and one of my favorite games.",757.6
"you can shoot people, and be a snob about it because it isnt call of duty. 12/9",70.8
"awesome game lot of fun and lot of players and also the devs supporting the game very well and giving what people wants.. a thing we rarely see nowdays with games. and only 15$ definitly a game to have:) cs:go footage :) to show what it looks like",517.7
"extremely fun in casual mode, extremely intense in competitive mode! a game for any mood! recommend.",198.2
"its counter-strike. no innovation here, but what it does, it does well. there is pretty much no aimbotting, so that is a big plus, although i have seen wallhacks and smoke hacks. the operation maps are a huge plus. for a few bucks, you buy a pack of maps, which you can play in most of the modes, made by the community, and you get nice special drops for them. all around a good deal for a great game that might otherwise seem stale, given that many of the maps have been around for over 10 years. this version plays a lot like cs 1.0, for those who can remember that far back. 1.0 was fairly different from 1.3, which was again fairly different from 1.6. but yeah, this is a very nice iteration of cs in my opinion, so 8/10 from me.",1422.6

"this game is really worth it and great way to kill time.",2.8
"its the same game with a different engine, but i suppose i cant expect valve to have too much inginuity, or give people what they want *cough cough* half life 3. either way, it does feel smoother than cs:s, so i guess its a step up. but its kinda like call of duty squared, where people joke about cod being the same game, when cs is literally the same game.",87.1
"huge upgrade from cs: source imo. great competitive scenes as well.",658.9
"unlike the previous counter strike games this one has more flavour added into it therefore making it a lot funner and less boring. the maps are a lot more detailed and designed making you feel like your in a real place not just some boring map with a few crates and 1 texture. the tactics are very well done. not like call of duty where you can just run out shooting and get shot multiple times and not die. if you do that on this game then may as well rage quit before thinking of buying this game. graphics are very good considering this is a source game. buy it. its worth it!",22.8
"ive never played the classic counter strike or counter strike: source, but this game made my first hours pretty nice. its really a contrast to the call of duty and battlefield series, and thats what makes this game feel like a fresh breeze in fps games. its fast, it can be frustrating, but its get addictive. would recommend to anyone who is tired of the modern shooters.",4.2

"is fun and there are a lot of people playing this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!",248.3
"great game! the mixture of cs source graphics and the feeling of cs 1.6 is amazing. although the frequent updates seems to be untested, meaning every 5th update or so leaves players unable to play for a while until fixed. still, as a former 1.6 player i strongly recommend this game for everyone who enjoys a challenging multiplayer game.",823.8

"coming from the battlefield franchise (bfbc2, bf3 and bf4) i was extremely frustrated on how ea/dice managed bf3 and then bf4, one year to get a huge patch to fix only half of the game... so i bought cs:go, and man, maybe we dont have tanks, helis, jets and levolution but we have real teamwork, close to flawless netcode, great weapon balance and of course a warmhearted and helpfull community. i dont regret my choice. rating: 10/10",406.0

"excellent all time fanatic comp. game always good!",1175.7
"i really enjoy csgo. i am however a little annoyed with the recoil.. everything reminds me of the awesome cs 1.6 that i still regularly play...except the recoil i think thats what keeps me coming back to 1.6 is that the recoil actually makes sense the game is still good otherwise.. i would buy it again :)",831.3
"this game has a p90 in it. i swear i feel like i am getting owned by little cod kids everytime they spray my head from 1000000000000000000 inches away. other than that its good to go. 9/10",801.7

"after many many patches this game is ing awesome! i was in the closed beta and knew how it sucked, the hitregestration on the offical servers was just so bad for me and i missed my silenced m4a1! they fixed the connection problem and added the silenced m4a1 and usp-45. i also like like the awp is, some cfg tweaks make this game look not so much like tf2. matchmaking is cool too. the idea with the offical servers is great, you dont have to search for a good one like in source. many of the public source servers today i dislike because there full of  like round end sounds and overlays... in my opinium this game was a desaster after release but is playable now, they fixed the random recoil, the deagle sucks but the p99 and p250 are great alternatives. the aiming feels better as in source, not so cube like. 10/10 great game, and there still patches coming. i dont support the idea of adding skins to the game, but ive got some from drops and im happy with them. the option to play on offiicial community maps is great to.",784.9

"one of the best things about this game is that it is nothing like the conventional shooter. its nothing like call of duty, battlefield, halo, etc. its definitely refreshing to play something so unique and actually challanging after years of military shooters. also, the challange it possess creates a unique gaming atmosphere. look, there is no way that someone can pick up this game and master it within a short period. this game will somewhat punish you in the beginning (like dark souls), but thats okay because this will teach you the ins-and-outs of this simple, yet complex game. it will be so rewarding to see how much you have improved over a number of play sessions. you cant be the best without losing. buy this game. you wont regret it.",172.5

"counter strike: global offensive is basically a very big update to counter strike: source. featuring much better graphics, gameplay, maps, etc. i really enjoy playing this game whether i win or lose matches. cs:go, in my opinion, is a much better alternative to call of duty. but, i was definitely not expecting valve to give cs:go the tf2 treatment, with the skins and items. today, you have knives going for about $200+, and thats just an outragous price for a virtual item. to see people are actually buying items and making money off of this game (and losing more) is just, wow. im personally not a fan of this, but i guess, it seemed to of worked out for valve in the long run. every time i see someone with an extremely expensive knife/skin, it kills me a little on the inside. cs:go is still a very fun game nonetheless, and would suggest it to anyone fond of strategic fps games. just, try not to spend too much money on these kind of games. sometimes, you dont even realize how much money youre spending on it.",244.8

"a fresh perspective on the modern shooter. the casual play of this game is average and entertaining with several community produced game modes, varying from a mini-games based server to a server where you surf and slide down large ramps all the meanwhile fighting off opponents. the competitive play is what sets this game aside from any other shooter i have played. in the competitive mode there is an air of intensity and focus each time i play, with a need to rise in rank you do all you can to communicate to youre team effectively in order to secure a win. the sheer amount of effectiveness in strategy and tactics a team can deploy eclipses that of what 1 team member can do. the game also forces you and youre team to emrace the economic factors of the in game play, this is unique to the counter strike series and creates a whole new branch of possiblities in strategy. the 15 bucks for this game was more than well spent, i can imagine myself playing for atleast another 100 hours. 9.5/10",262.0

"easily one of the best shooters out there. the guns are awesome. the maneuverability is awsome. sniping people is a load of fun. it is way faster than call of duty. speaking on cod, counter strike go allows you to use your brain more to outhink your opponent. there are more ways of tricking the enemy into effectively killing themselves. while there is this to a certain extent in cod, the truth is theres little room to make a decisive decision that wont end with you getting a death after you have taken one kill. on a further note, i like the games when everyone agrees to use knife only. thats enjoyable with its own hilarous moments. all in all, a well developed game that is far superior to the ones which came before it.",70.7

"i like this game, was hard to get into at first, i used to play counter strike as a kid, when it was like.. 1.1 or something. so i am not a big counter-strike gamer, but i like this game as i said, and it gets more fun for each passing day. the only thing that is horrible with this game (which is a shame, because its more or less the entire game) is that you have to play with other people, who take the game so seriously, that one might think this is a real game of death. if you die or drop a grenade at the wrong spot, youre gonna get scolded for it, people are going to call you a , er, , gaylord e.t.c and probably 90% of the cs:go community apparently did my mom once or twice. yeah, but... 4/5.",186.9
"i call this type of game a gun game, a game where all the info you need to know is the fact that you have a gun, and ya know what, i despise this game. i really do. yet i always manage to come back to this game. all in all its a good game, a great game. it controls fluently, the community isnt awful, the guns are nice and responsive, the game feel is fantastic, and for the most part everything usually works. now what really soured the experience of cs:go for me was the inclusion of weapon skins, it turned to game from man that guy is really good to oh, this jackass has a $400 knife now this may be nitpicky, but when youve played dust ii 12 times in a row because people refuse to pick otherwise, youre allowed to get annoyed at simple things. anyway thats my two cents on the matter, i recommend this for people who like the gun game genre.",134.0

"at first i thought, why do i need cs:go when i have cs:s?, well, that changed when i got this. there is so much more involved in cs:go than cs:s. personally, its a lot better and more fun to play. get the game now you fool, you wont regret it!!! :d",2.2
"currently my favorite video game. i love that the tthey added the market aspect of the game. for people like me who get really into a game the market aspect is a great way for steam to rip the money right out of my back pocket. love the random drops and everything about this game.",620.1
"it is pretty much exactly what you would think it is, cs:go is essentially cs:s but with improved graphics. valve added some new features that add some variation to the game, such as new gamemodes and maps. im particularily fond of the arms race gamemode myself, since i enjoy respawning instead of waiting for the round to end when i inevitably die. the new weapons make little-to-no difference and do next to nothing to contribute to the game. but in my opinion, the absolute worst thing is the continued existance of the awp. counter-strikes most controversial and infamous weapon for good reason. but to be fair, cs:go is not that bad of a game, its still rather enjoyable and is relatively cheap as well. recommended.",12.3

"only promblem with this game is valve should add more guns and maps from previous counter-strike games and leave them in.",47.9
"omg, frankie why why you do dis, this game was like an innocent child with loving parents, a great home, and pretty well off. what you decided to do, is find something vuerable about the child (the game) and use it to get inside his head. you  him, you ruined him, just like you did this game, the community was so fun and nice. then  you used an awp your a ! that is what i deal with when i kill the enemy team with an awp. you ruined the game like the little child.",361.5

"7/10 this game is not bad but not good, the problem i see with this game, is that it just gets repetitive after playing a few games.this is more of a arcade game, than a fast paced multiplayer game. i would recommend this game, if you just wanna have some fun with friends or are cappable of teamwork. i wouldnt recommend this game to players who wanna invest time into a shooter game, because this game is kindda stale in just a cople of hours.",186.7

"global offensive is definitely a counter-strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. this is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game thats as satisfying now as it ever was, but its for a specific kind of player. if youre not willing to learn to play different than youre used to, look elsewhere. otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.",944.2

"my life was in shambles. my wife had left me. my parents casted me out of my house. my kids starving and begging for food. then i found counterstrike. the game ran so smooth on my  computer. a supreme race of next gen gaming for such a outdated pc. with the simple press to speak mic keys i wouldnt have to hear my loud  ing kids beg me for more food. i could hear only what i wanted to hear. i think theyre dead now but that just means more time for counterstrike. its truly a game for the gods. overall i give it a 8/10",140.8
"being the old counter-strike player i am, i never got into any competitive teams or anything of course. i did play cs 1.6 but of course played cs:s when it ws still in its prime and i do have to say putting at least close to 100 hours in (more since steam kinda resets the hours played if your gone for a long time i think) that cs:go is the best itteration in the series. gunplay was fantastic and the community game modes that were included as official ones is amazing on valves part. of course theres the improved models, textures and such, but for me i care no less for visuals than i care more for overall playability and gameplay. i find that on a mac and pc it plays extremely well and that it still keeps the core functions of all previous counter-strike itterations. well done valve. job well done.",463.2
"another thing i would like to add: if valve does not stop the hackers, afk-ers, trollers, they will be losing a lot of players who once loved to play cs:go. heres a suggestion: put the hackers in game with other hackers once you managed to find them and not tell them. this way, they wont keep creating new accounts seeing this game is cheap to buy. as for afk-ers and trollers, a long ban should be put in place. highly recommended for windows users only. as for macosx, you will find it very difficult to play without crashing. i had to reduce my graphic settings to the lowest and many other changes made under video settings just to play without crashing as often as it should be. value needs to get this patched up for mac users as soon as possible. its been like this since the last 2 patches and they dont seem to care about it.",725.5

"first of all i was playing cs from the very early days, way before 1.6 and when i tried playing cs: sorce i had this feeling that i was missing something, dunno what it was, i just preferred good old 1.6, anyways after only 2 days of giving cs:go a chance to charm me i must say it did. obviously its not 1.6 but i dont have this whirred feeling as i had playing cs:s - and i must say, merging this game whit ranking systems and creating few game types that may give fun for casual players and tryhards is really great improvement for this (remastered) game. why remastered? well, you can call it cs go or whatever, in its core its same old , good one and to be something more then - just new graphics, some improvements are needed. those are simple - but i like them, definitely worth trying out.",29.3

"awesome game! give me counter strike over cod and bf any day",48.1
"its a good game, definitely a big step up from css which blew giant  compared to 1.6. the only complaint i have with this game is that once you get to badge or higher, the amount of blatant and toggling hackers that you see in matchmaking is ludicrously high and makes you not want to play. the system itself which tries to balance the teams usually fails miserably too, but thats nothing new in valve games, as evidenced by dota 2s horrendous matchmaking. decent game overall, has some glaring issues though like completely ineffective anti-cheat.",1612.3
"counter-strike global offensive is an amazing game. coming from team fortress 2 and mobas such as league of legends and dota 2, i did not expect much from this game, much less for it to be the tight, well-paced, tactical shooter it is. i was wrong though. cs:go has its own perspective on the fps genre and it perfects that spin to a tee. matches not only consist of individual skill to make the shot but also team coordination as a whole to defend or blow up the map. granted, this game is quite challenging at first, but get past the learning curve and a tight, extremely satisfying tactical shooter awaits you.",127.3
"i like what they did with counter-strike franchise.",263.9
"first of all, counter strike : global offensive requires more skills to play than the good old call of the faglords : satans house. secondly, the community is more friendly and young players are more respected than the cod community (#) lastly, cs is for men, it has more strategy, it takes, perception and deception to master the game",1009.8

"this counter strike is a good fps and its price is very interesting and attractive too. we have a good balance between 1.6 and source. graphically, its good. you can play with a team in matchmaking competitive. the game is searching for you the enemies. and this is in function of your skills with the system of ranks. we have also some updates with new maps but you need to buy a pass to play on these maps. but if you have some friends, you can buy only one pass and after you need only to join your friend on the new maps. the price is 5usd or 4,5. but, you can easily get this money in selling the different weapons or crates that you can drop on the game.",1572.2

"theyve done a great job striking a balance of classic counter-strike play that veterans will love. but also introducing enough new gameplay to keep the franchise fresh. new players and lifetime players will all love this. what i really like is that new players can get into this game. the ranking system, and various game modes, will get you introduced to the game in a fairly non-frustrating way. while the veteran players can play against themselves in competitive ranked games - vs. similarly ranked players.",693.2
"global offensive is definitely a counter-strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. this is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game thats as satisfying now as it ever was, but its for a specific kind of player. if youre not willing to learn to play different than youre used to, look elsewhere. otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.",520.3
"a new entry to the counter-strike family that does more than just upgrading the graphics. the new matchmaking for competitive has made the game easier to approah for new-comers and more challenging for veterans; as you face enemies who are close to your skill level. i reccomend this old-school tactical fps for anyone who wants a new rebalanced feel on an old shooter formula.",656.6
"huge improvement compared to source <3 a very good game to release that stress you build up on your day by day only downside is that there are some ragers in here but u can just mute them and keep playing ^^",414.8
"this is a very good first person shooter: it is easy to learn, but difficult to master. there is a one problemsi have with it though, and that is the presence of microtransactions. while they may be entirely cosmetic, i dont like microtransactions in any game, especially a paid game. otherwise however this is a very good fps, almost every gun is different. while some may be obviously superior to others, its possible to kill anyone with any gun. the competitave mode is fairly balanced most of the time, but there are some games where you are either entirely outmatched or there is little to no competition. in summary this is a very good fps that, while difficult not impossible, and very fun at that.",1107.7

"very excellent game, it has a closer feel to the cs 1.6 along with a few changes that only improve the game for the better. the game is slick and smooth and strong in the competitive side. being a cs player for over 7 years i can say this game has gotten to me most. the added ranking system along with dedicated servers to play competitve mode just makes cs much more appealing than it used to be. also, they added skins to the game in which you can make your guns look beautiful as you go around on your tactical killing sprees. for veteran and new coming counter-strike players. it is the fps game to get. if you arent so sure it will be worth your $15.00, you can always get it for $5.00 on steam sale. either way...it is a purchase you will not regret.",236.3
"having played some of the previous counter strike games i am glad to say that this one lives up to the reputation of a great shooter. with implimenting steam market items in the game it is still not a common pay to win game as the paid items in game are purly visual and not neccasery. the game is very fun to play with friends and exercising great use of good communication and teamworking skills!",232.5

"when i joined my first couple of matches i noticed something pretty obvious. everyone who plays the game is pretty much a pro since the game has been out for a while. i really only have fun with this game when i play it with friends only. if you get the game you should try training with bots or having someone show you the tricks of the game. all in all, the game is fun to play and has very fast gameplay. its not my favorite game, but it will keep you into the gameplay until you ragequit. i would recommend this game to anyone who likes games like call of duty.",8.0
"a really good fps game with the purpose of getting headshots and not just spraying like other fps games (cod). this game takes teamwork, skills, practice, and alot of knowledge on the certain guns spray patterns. overall this game is truely enjoyable and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a blast with a bunch of other people playing some good old counter strike. the graphic are much better than previous games, and now allow u to be able to change the appearance of ur gun with weapon sprays. i really enjoy this game and i hope you get a copy of this game to see how great it is.",1104.7

"counter strike global offensive is a game which refuses to conform to modern first person shooters. this is what makes it such an amazing game. i love a game which is purely about your own skill, not about what weapons you have unlocked, what rank you are or how much real money you need to pay for advantages such as better weapons. there is a real competitive atmosphere revolving around this game. players actually work together as a team, communicate to each other, manage their economy and as a result will grant them victory. the complexity behind cs:go is immense and this makes it extremely fun to play. its a mind game, its a maths game, its a strategy game, its a shooter game and its a valve game. need i say more?",661.7

"counterstrike really struck gold since its launch in 2012. not only the game on its own is nice looking and plays very well, the workshop offers a place for the community to put their own designed skins for the guns. this is probably the reason why valve also makes allot of money off of this game. it is pretty cheap at around 5-7 dollars/euros, but the selling of skins on the market, even though they only get a couple of cents for each,really gets in the money. not to mention the cases; these are boxes filled with a variety of gun skins ranging from ordinary (blue) to extremely rare (red), if you get really lucky and strike a knife you are instantly guaranteed around 50+ dollars (at the moment). ofcourse it is very prestigious to own a knife so most people like to show it around. lastly, recently a tournament in germany attracted the attention of over 400,000 people on twitch at once! this is huge, making cs:go one of the best shooters of this moment.",374.9

"still the a good game that doesnt demand much. you play casually or competitively depending on how much time you would like to commit. the game is simple and the better part of it is that unlike much other shooter games, there is a lot to learn in skill mechanics but because of that, you can see improvements in your skills as you commit more time in the game. though this makes the game a bit harsh for beginners, but trust me, with experience and pratice, the game will open up as you climb through the different skill levels and eventually youd be into it.",913.5

"cs:go by far one of the best fps for pc. this game will bring moments of despair while bringing moments of pure accomplishment. this is like the call of duty of pc but better, you have multiple cheap exspansions that become free after the event. competetive - where pros play for rankings deathmatch - where you kill, die, spawn, kill, die, spawn over again and again. demolition - basically search and destroy arms race - go throught most weapons in the game to finally a knife and get a kill with each to win. this game is a 10/10 for me and i highly recomend it! also no aiming! only on guns with scopes you can aim!!! beautiful!",143.3

"the game is a lot different from source. i find the game unique because it brings other new things such as mollies (fire nades), or even being able to put out those fires with smokes. i do think and hope that the competitive servers get fixed to 128tic so we can get better regs",527.3

"10/10 most competetive fps game ever made. as the name counter-strike it pays to its homage. having the same controls based on the counter-strike mod for half-life its gameplay still remains faithful but with a boost with the latest engine and modernization of some guns. compared to other games that require an unfair leveling system, this game forces players to make critical decisions, work as a team, improve on dexterity, polish hand-eye coordination. hint: be a sport, if you win it is because of the teams effort, if you lose theyre just better than you(unless the legitly cheat).",718.2
"one of the best multiplayer experiences on pc. ive tried the likes of battlefield 3 and had painful experience online, but cs:go works every single time. mines a 2 mbps connection which goes down to 512 kbps at times and there never is a lag... i was a big fan of the original cs 1.6 and never thought there could be anything simpler and / or better than that, i am glad i was wrong! super like!!!!",20.8

"as an originally console to recently pc gamer, the learning curve was huge, but with practise it just gets better and better, it might be frustrating, but if you stick with it, the game is very rewarding to play. the only problem with the game is the lack of official gamemodes, there is classic casual, and competitive, demolition, arms race and deathmatch, i count these as the bare neccesities for a first person shooter. other than this, the game is very good.",1423.4

"cs:go has received a numerous amount of patches since its released and it has improved the game tenfold. it is fundamentally better and a lot more weapons are viable then they were in cs:source. i would still give the source engine the edge because there were a lot of fun things to do in the custom servers like bunny hopping and surf seemed funner in general but cs:go makes up for it competetively . the brand new e-sports take on the series gives it more depth than ever with its leagues and unlockable items that you gain through playing ranked matches. you can even sell said items and buy skins and just have a general competitive feel to cs:go. overall, i enjoy it now more than i ever did since the release of it was eh, but now in my opinion, the game is a 9/10. source is still great and 1.6 is legendary. all cs players will own all 3 anyways cause whats a cs:condition zero kappa",130.6

"counterstrike really struck gold since its launch in 2012. not only the game on its own is nice looking and plays very well, the workshop offers a place for the community to put their own designed skins for the guns. this is probably the reason why valve also makes allot of money off of this game. it is pretty cheap at around 5-7 dollars/euros, but the selling of skins on the market, even though they only get a couple of cents for each,really gets in the money. not to mention the cases; these are boxes filled with a variety of gun skins ranging from ordinary (blue) to extremely rare (red), if you get really lucky and strike a knife you are instantly guaranteed around 50+ dollars (at the moment). ofcourse it is very prestigious to own a knife so most people like to show it around. lastly, recently a tournament in germany attracted the attention of over 400,000 people on twitch at once! this is huge, making cs:go one of the best shooters of this moment.",374.9

"counter-strike: russian anger simulator is an excellent language learning tool for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of eastern european languages and culture. after some brief training you will find yourself in a competitive learning exercise where you are given four loud russian comrades who attempt to show you around the map. as our four russian premade comrades scream incoherently and you attempt to translate their grievances you should notice that you are being kicked from the game. however, just as all hope to translate  is about to be lost, our friend pak01_000 swoops in to save the day, constantly removing you from the game and then leaving you with a ban when you finally decide give up! (if this doesnt happen dont worry. the chances are youll see a your map [maps/de_dust2.bsp] differs from the server message and get kicked/banned anyway!) and thus ends your first  trip to mother russia.",714.9
"if you are into heavy fps games. you will found counter strike global offensive one of the few games where everything works in them. in counter strike global offensive most of the servers are running with 64-128 tickrate, and that means that your movement will update faster then other fpss. if you take battlefield 4 for a example most of the server on battlefield 4 is running 30 tickrate, so there you can see that your movement will update faster on counter strike global offensive than on battlefield 4. the number 1 thing about counter strike global offensive is teamwork. if you play competitive you will see that many of the people playing competitive will communicate over voip. so i will recommend counter strike global offensive to all people because its a good game, you can play with friends, you can make money of it, you can see what skill level you are my the in-game ranking system that goes from sliver to global elite. so i will give counter strike global offensive 10/10",1285.8

"counter-strike has many incarnations. some who are classic, some who are legendary and now this. i can say as a player of all of em that this game does live up to the hype of a modern release of the classic game. why? simply because it is different with the same cs principals and feel. so, if you are a cs fan. it is definitively worth a shot, the game is great! -remy mareno aka lonelywalk",65.3

"i love this game so much is extremely competitive and yet it is still welcoming to noobs. learning curve of weapons is great. only downside to the game is it is no longer the original game but it is a fresh take to our modern games. highly reccomend + has drops that are really good i reccomend buying passes to get best drops buy this game",155.0

"i played this game like 80 hours i think, and my perspective on this game was... hmm, ok, it is the old engine of cs, and all the mechanics are almost the same, except that the shooting part its much more harder then the cs 1.6, for example. the visuals in their base line are pretty much the same, but you know they look much more gooder then the old ones. the community varies from guy to guy, i mean, you should expect everything, and when i say everything, its everything, some weird folks down there, but you know, they have their role, making you laugh sometimes. another aspect that i liked was the menu, every knid of menu, pretty clever the buy menu, it looks awesome, the start menu, it is very good structured and it left me a very good perspective on it. so, i must say that this game it is not a waste of money, you should buy it.",183.7

"cs:go by far one of the best fps for pc. this game will bring moments of despair while bringing moments of pure accomplishment. this is like the call of duty of pc but better, you have multiple cheap exspansions that become free after the event. competetive - where pros play for rankings deathmatch - where you kill, die, spawn, kill, die, spawn over again and again. demolition - basically search and destroy arms race - go throught most weapons in the game to finally a knife and get a kill with each to win. this game is a 10/10 for me and i highly recomend it! also no aiming! only on guns with scopes you can aim!!! beautiful!",143.3

"i like playing fps games like cs go. the thing is when you decide to sell things on the market people add you to offer you some services. like trading and etc. but i found that more than 80 percent of them are scammers. i got lucky on a crate box i opened and i got something very rare and planned to sell on the market. when i got friend request they always offered 2nd hand payment instead of steam market. first time ever meeting this offer i fell for the scam not knowing about the trading policy on steam and not knowing how trades really work. i thought if i got scammed and had evidence i could contact steam and have steam done something about it but items like in cs go cant be returned b/c of the policy knowing that after getting scammed by the cs go community in steam. but overall game play is fine i would reccomend this game based on the gameplay with friends. hoping policy can be lighter on new traders and newtimers.",69.6

"played cs games since cs 1.0. loved it then... hate it now. but why shouldnt you buy this specific iteration in the series? 1. same graphics. nothing to get excited about at all. if you have css, you pretty much have this. 2. same maps. 20 years later, de_dust is still boring and yet still wins every map vote. 3. the game is well balanced and fun. enter awp. again. hurr lets just add this 1 hit kill gun so nobody wants to use anything else ever unless the server forces them and the game becomes a ridiculous cluster of unrealistic, window-camping snipers 4. no iron sights? its 2014. the aimpoint scopes on guns that traditionally had scopes of some kind, are nice. but its still awful to not be able to aim most of your guns. in 2014. in conclusion, i bought this in a sale for about $4 and im still disappointed. i no longer consider myself a counter-strike fan.",44.8

(edit 02/07/14) three weeks after being banned, i would have expected the ban system to have taken my ban to 30 minutes, however it is a 7 day ban, dont believe the lies cs:go flows out. you ban does not roll back in any form, there is no point in buying this game if you play competitive.",123.9

"death is a great teacher. failure in counter-strike: global offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldnt have done, and how you could have done better. counter-strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. growth is an important factor in global offensive, especially if youre coming into counter-strike fresh or after a sabbatical. this is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. if youre a call of duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. counter-strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.",1097.4

"as someone who was only relatively familiar with the counter strike games before playing global offensive (around 30 hours on source), i found it incredibly easy to jump into cs go and it quickly became my most played game. the competitive matchmaking is both addicting and satisfying, although sometimes stressful. it has a great community behind it on websites like reddit who have always been willing to help newer players in my experience. every now and then you find some unlikeable people in matchmaking and online. my advice is to jump straight into the game and get involved with learning the complex gameplay and start having fun. 13/13 charetard stars",423.2

"being that i have only played this game for less then 50 hours and can already jump into the competetive gamemode and play with other people around the world to earn ranks is a great thing to have added to a game. i have played many first person shooters and this one by far caught my interest because in most fpss you can ads but in this game it was all about hip fire and controlling your spray, with the occasional weapons that can ads. i highly recomend this game to everyone that can afford the $15 price. if you cant wait for a sale! everything goes on sale eventually, and this is definetly worth the wait!",206.4

"well, this is the only fps game that i continued to play since the early versions of counter-strike. i can only comment on the classic competitive mode since that is my favorite and most played mode. many might think that cs is just a simple game where terrorist plants a bomb and counter-terrorist defuse the bomb. simple? i recommended to re-think that thought. cs is not a single player tactical game but a team tactical game. simple game mechanics does not necessarily mean an easy and boring game. be paired with noobs like myself and fight against veteran players with good aim; you and the team you belong to gets pummeled. being a lone player instead of a team player will result in losing the match(es). in cs, you have to be a team player, have an initiative, and situational awareness; add to that a good decision making skill whether to do it or not.",81.9

"where to start? this game has it all. great graphics, plenty of guns (including awesome camoflauges), and a large community. while it may not have as many maps as cs:s, or buggy bots, the tactical gameplay makes up for these flaws. all in all, i would say this is a must play for a big fps fan. 8.5/10",177.3
"counterstrike is a staple for anybody who is a fan of shooters. gone are ranks, classes and other modern tropes leaving only challenging skill based gameplay. you will suck. you will be headshot. you will get better. when you do and decide to visit another game you will realize how casual shooters have become.",28.2

"this game keeps the core of cs, it takes a lot more skill then most first-person shooters would take, its not really a game you can jump into and have a good time, you have to put some work into the game to get better. the in-game competitive matchmaking allows cs:go to shine, but there are instances when you are going to run into trolls, hackers, etc. would recommend to anyone looking for another competitive game to play. the one thing that did disappoint me, was the more harsh community.",367.7

"it is pretty much exactly what you would think it is, cs:go is essentially cs:s but with improved graphics. valve added some new features that add some variation to the game, such as new gamemodes and maps. im particularily fond of the arms race gamemode myself, since i enjoy respawning instead of waiting for the round to end when i inevitably die. the new weapons make little-to-no difference and do next to nothing to contribute to the game. but in my opinion, the absolute worst thing is the continued existance of the awp. counter-strikes most controversial and infamous weapon for good reason. but to be fair, cs:go is not that bad of a game, its still rather enjoyable and is relatively cheap as well. recommended.",12.3

"an incredibly fun fps that is well worth the price. however, keep in mind that this fps is completely different from other shooters like cod or battlefield. if youre going to treat cs:go like such, youre going to have a bad time. imo, cs:go has a much higher learning curve compared to these fpses ive mentioned and youre probably going suck when you first start. however, once you pass this learning curve, getting kills will be much more satisfying in this game compared to getting kills in cod/bf. 10 chickens/10 would recommend.",78.8
"dis game is the ultamite ragging machine if you are playing with people who dont even know where the enemy is reguardless that you told them several times through both chat and mic. otherwise its quick pase the when you get the final kill that wins the round it will feel like you just won the olympics",1485.6
"beginners ! be careful, this game asks a lot of patience and practice to be  good  and more enjoyable ! it asks also a lot of  rage  and  mind game , sometime things incomprehensible happen, maybe youre against a cheater (yeah, there are a lot of them unfortunately) or youre against a good play, maybe you should ask him some tips if you want to ! if you like fps, i would really recommend it !",1129.0
"same counter strike action with minor gameplay tweaks. hitboxes tend to be better than css but still not as good as 1.6. added a cool gun skin feature for all weapons along with mystery cases to unlock these skins. a gamblers nightmare as you will probably end up spending more money on this game than you should.",717.8

"valve,you beautiful watermelon loving,3 declining butterflies. counter strike: global offensive feels like a very fresh,new game after playing cs 1.6 or cs:source. theyve changed many things and visuals are just the start of it. the game is very balanced and takes good skill for you to win. the new competitive mode and matchmaking style is very similiar to dota 2 and that is great seeing as dota 2s system works great! those who are not a fan of it can always play unranked matches by using the good ol source server browser. other than that,cs:go had an update not too long ago that adds a bunch of weapon skins that can be acquired by simply playing the game. so it follows the style of dota 2 (and a lil bit of tf2) yet it doesnt ruin the balance. valve has also remade the classic maps from the older counter strike games and with that added new ones. this is definitely a game any fps lover should get!",336.4

"pretty damn good job valve! as a fanatic 1.6 player, i think cs:go its a well made update to this classic. i mean, the phisics and graphics did changed a lot but they did it tastefully and right. im very pleased with the competitive matchmaking system, i think it was about time we cut out the intermediary (see playzeek/gathernetwor/etc.). all in all, i think cs:go will keep me in front of my monitor at least as much as 1.6 did.",343.1

"this is by far the most popular competetive fps, which is around for many years, counting from the release of original cs. the graphics in this game are amazing, but you will play on low to get the most frames for serious play, casual players are also very catered and will have fun in this game after a week of learning how to shoot because this game is totally different from others and has recoil and spread mechanics like you would encounter in real life. the sound is not as good as in previous games, meaning it will be harder to detect footsteps position, but it is still enjoyable. the matchmaking is the biggest and only downfall in this game, a lot of times (30%) you will get faced against too hard or too easy opponents. overall 9/10, buy this game, i would not be sorry even if it was 60 usd like other games around, i would rather spend it on cs:go than stupid cod games.",121.1

"great game in general, but rank system is complete . its all about wins, not kill and death ratio or skill. even the worst player can be high rank, all he needs is to play with someone good. he can have extreme negative kd but still rank up because his team won. because of this there is always a huge gap between players on each team, kind of obious when top player got 20-9 and bottom player got 6-24. and all this in a game where the team and team play is this important, also it makes it fatal to be put in a team with low skill players.",719.7

"i love this game because its not only about running and shooting, its a more tactical shooter and more skill and team play based than all other games i know. its great to play with friends in a team but also allone its still good to play. another big advantage is the price, its a brilliant game and comparable to bf or cod but it costs only 13.99 euro in steam, and you never get tired playing.but the big advantage of the price is the biggest disadvantage as well because many hackers are online and only their steam account gets banned from cs, not their ip or pc and buying a new game for 13.99 is not a big deal.",1514.7

(counter-source is my most played games by like 100 hours btw.) we were playing arms race and demolition and casual mode. arms race is stupid but so much fun. demolition is a fun quick version of defuse where you get new guns every time you kill someone. those stupid bots? well you can take over them if you die. very fun with friends, not great own your own but arms race is quite addicting and allows you to play on your own if you want. i like this game, source will always be my favourite shooter game, but this one is really good too.",50.1

"cs:go is a tactical shooter where your team is made up of 5 terrorists, or counter-terrorists. what makes this fps stand out from the others is the amount of though that has to go in to making your decisions, while trying to win. if youre running low on cash, you can eco, meaning that you buy cheaper weapons (or no weapons at all) to try to gain back that cash next round. if youre pinned down in a bad position, and have a smoke, you could use it to block the view of your enemy, while taking out the other. the ranking system is made in such a way that youll (almost) always be put in a game with people at your own level of skill. this makes it easier to learn the game, while it also might give you a challenge whilst doing so. if, however, none of this appeals to you, there are several community servers providing different gamemodes like jailbreak, and surf. heck, even valve provides gamemodes like arms race (which is just gungame), deathmatch and casual.",448.7

"its quite a bit of fun. its pretty much what you can expect from counter-strike. theres a couple gameplay mechanics that have been changed from cs/cs:s to cs:go. mostly competetive improvements, stat changes that makes most of the guns viable, modernazations (the good kind), and the revamped hud. im a fan of the score and players alive being bunched with the timer. as for statistical changes, they seem to stay (mostly) familiar with the previous games. i dont know, im no expert in any way, shape, nor form. the problem is that the hit detection is awful (that, or my aim is terrible). from what i read, this is because the official servers run on 64 ticks per second, half as much as the maximum 128. another thing is that the community is a bunch of asses, but theres not much you can do there. i recommend this if you enjoy team-based tactics and coordination, and combat that involves more thought process than theres the enemy, right-click left-click- oh, im dead, better respawn.",65.3

"the game is amazing! always hated source, but this one feels like it finally took a step in the right direction. the biggest issue i have with it is the matchmaking system, since it never seems to match up correctly or make any sense. still, i cant get enough of it. the thing they do where you pay to be able to play competetive mode on user made maps is a bit annoying since it becomes like a subscription fee if you want to play anything other than the old classics. also the russians only use a vodka bottle with a membrane in it, and it can become difficult to communicate, and youll become deaf. 10/10 would be called , vodka vodka, boris yeltsin for another 300 hours.",340.9

"heyyo, its another counter-strike game. its got decent graphics (using the aged source engine) but among the most solid gameplay of any shooter to date. adding in weapon skins is a nice touch though. luckily theres nothing very offensive due to using the steam marketplace for most of the skins plus valve is always running contests and such on the game and its quite pro-scrim friendly with the built-in match making system that works good on top of the server browsing system. if you loved cs1.6 or css? im sure youll love cs global offensive. my only wish? cs go was on source engine 2 with much improved graphics instead of being more like an hd version of css. :p",4.4

"counter strike: global offensive (otherwise known as cs:go) is the newest game in the counter strike series. since ive already done a review of counter strike: source, im just going to talk about the many gameplay changes that go introduces to the series. firstly, the guns all have more kick to them, making run-n-gun players hugely greivanced. the guns all feel authentic and sound amazing, but i personally dont enjoy using the snipers and i cant stand the heavy weapons (i.e. miniguns). the weight of each gun has been pretty drastically increased, leaving slower and more methodical gameplay in its path. if you remember cs:s, there a probably 2 things you noticed: 1. there were very few shotguns, and 2. there were only two grenade types. well, in go, there are now 5 types of shotgun, and 4 different types of grenades! i personally believe is the best game in the counter strike series, and its methodical gameplay makes for a difficult experience, for both newcomers, and seasoned veterans.",15.2

"typical counter-strike game. consistantly good. some of the few changes in this game: - graphics and design. - addition of skins and knives. - official valve matchmaking servers. in my opinion, this is an improvement to a game that was already magic. get addicted! 8.7/10 ~ curious cat",1106.0

"absolutely great game. if you played cs 1.6 as a kid you should definitely try this edition!",170.6
"counter strike: global offensive is basically a very big update to counter strike: source. featuring much better graphics, gameplay, maps, etc. i really enjoy playing this game whether i win or lose matches. cs:go, in my opinion, is a much better alternative to call of duty. but, i was definitely not expecting valve to give cs:go the tf2 treatment, with the skins and items. today, you have knives going for about $200+, and thats just an outragous price for a virtual item. to see people are actually buying items and making money off of this game (and losing more) is just, wow. im personally not a fan of this, but i guess, it seemed to of worked out for valve in the long run. every time i see someone with an extremely expensive knife/skin, it kills me a little on the inside. cs:go is still a very fun game nonetheless, and would suggest it to anyone fond of strategic fps games. just, try not to spend too much money on these kind of games. sometimes, you dont even realize how much money youre spending on it.",244.8
"its really really violent, you kill people all the time, and you even have to plant bomb device every now and then. 9/10 would play again.",790.7
"this game is very fun and addicting. it makes you wanna play match after match. i like the realistic damage of the weapons as well. i also think the addition of weapon camos is great, and it adds a social aspect, trading. i recommend this game, but not for people who enjoy call of dutys fast-paced combat and killstreaks. this game is much more strategically based.",302.0
"back in the day counter-strike was all about teamwork and aggression now? its all about skins im a counter-strike veteran and when i first played cs:go man i was dissapointed m4a1-s is much much different then cs (higher recoil) and the ak-47? forget it. also my favorite handgun (desert eagle) is different too. i would recommend this game to newbies but to cs veterans? never! dont buy this game. personal score: 7/10",57.8
"worst community of game-history! many bugs. even more hackers. worst anti-cheat. bad matchmaking. low quality game servers. high server downtime. game crashing frequently. ingame-purchases. high transaction-fee for market offers. low price attracted even more hackers. no improvement to previous titels. paid dlc. 1/10 would not recommend.",455.0
"very interesting. i already play this game from 1.6 good job valve",6.9
"a fresh perspective on the modern shooter. the casual play of this game is average and entertaining with several community produced game modes, varying from a mini-games based server to a server where you surf and slide down large ramps all the meanwhile fighting off opponents. the competitive play is what sets this game aside from any other shooter i have played. in the competitive mode there is an air of intensity and focus each time i play, with a need to rise in rank you do all you can to communicate to youre team effectively in order to secure a win. the sheer amount of effectiveness in strategy and tactics a team can deploy eclipses that of what 1 team member can do. the game also forces you and youre team to emrace the economic factors of the in game play, this is unique to the counter strike series and creates a whole new branch of possiblities in strategy. the 15 bucks for this game was more than well spent, i can imagine myself playing for atleast another 100 hours. 9.5/10",262.0

"if you have just picked it up and never played a counter-strike game this will feel very different... say if your coming from cod or bf look at some guides before you play it will help.... frankieonpcin1080p has some guides on his youtube or you check out guides made by the community or the warowl has a series on his channel dedicated to teaching people how to play.... with that out of the way this is a very unique shooter even if you have played source this may feel different or atleast thats how i felt but eventually you will get used to the mechanics of the game.... some great map design and if you have a team on competetive who works together you are almost guaranteed a win... as long as you have teamwork and map knoweldge/game awareness and do callouts right you will be unstoppable.... 9.7/10 great game almost perfect....",1574.3
"was playing this game at an airport and security heard the bomb has been planted coming from my laptop and i was deported. 10/10",16.3
"easily one of the best shooters out there. the guns are awesome. the maneuverability is awsome. sniping people is a load of fun. it is way faster than call of duty. speaking on cod, counter strike go allows you to use your brain more to outhink your opponent. there are more ways of tricking the enemy into effectively killing themselves. while there is this to a certain extent in cod, the truth is theres little room to make a decisive decision that wont end with you getting a death after you have taken one kill. on a further note, i like the games when everyone agrees to use knife only. thats enjoyable with its own hilarous moments. all in all, a well developed game that is far superior to the ones which came before it.",70.7

"this game is kind a looks like cs source but its in more of a future, i guess and the weapons are more futuristic. you can get skins for your guns, you can unlock them buy just playing but if you cant be bothered you can just buy them and most of them are really cheap. you can unlock stickers for your weapon but to unlocked it you need to buy a key that costs some money. this was a really quick review so i hope i helped you with something in cs go and yeah thanks for reading. im out peace!",31.0

"some serious and intense , this game offers a very competitive fps environment for those who are willing to play seriously and for those who are able to co-operate with teammates. it provides a different feel that other fps games liek halo, cod, battlefield doesnt truly offer as its ranked matches provides much more intense and adrenaline fueled action, like literaly, your heart will be pumping ridicoulously fast.",335.1

"its a seriously addictive and fun game to play, still a few glitches here and there, as in all games, but the biggest one is the bans, seriously over zealous, so beware, like with the bullet that hits you from around a corner, youll never know you got it till it hits you. then theres nothing you can do.",811.8
"i like this game, was hard to get into at first, i used to play counter strike as a kid, when it was like.. 1.1 or something. so i am not a big counter-strike gamer, but i like this game as i said, and it gets more fun for each passing day. the only thing that is horrible with this game (which is a shame, because its more or less the entire game) is that you have to play with other people, who take the game so seriously, that one might think this is a real game of death. if you die or drop a grenade at the wrong spot, youre gonna get scolded for it, people are going to call you a , er, , gaylord e.t.c and probably 90% of the cs:go community apparently did my mom once or twice. yeah, but... 4/5.",186.9
"i call this type of game a gun game, a game where all the info you need to know is the fact that you have a gun, and ya know what, i despise this game. i really do. yet i always manage to come back to this game. all in all its a good game, a great game. it controls fluently, the community isnt awful, the guns are nice and responsive, the game feel is fantastic, and for the most part everything usually works. now what really soured the experience of cs:go for me was the inclusion of weapon skins, it turned to game from man that guy is really good to oh, this jackass has a $400 knife now this may be nitpicky, but when youve played dust ii 12 times in a row because people refuse to pick otherwise, youre allowed to get annoyed at simple things. anyway thats my two cents on the matter, i recommend this for people who like the gun game genre.",134.0
