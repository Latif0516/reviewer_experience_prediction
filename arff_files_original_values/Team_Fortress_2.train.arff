"team fortress is a very addicting fun and stragetic game. this game also allows us to plan before going into combat for example choosing what class would be best for attacking the other team as well as thinking of where to build your sentry guns that will be best for your team and to get easy kills. i also like this game since it enables item finds which is very intresting and those weapons are helpful for those who cant donate. no hates, just a little brief explanation why i love this game so much <3. ~ the pyro vision",196.8

"i highly recommend this game, mainly because theres so much more to do that just battle both teams on one server. there are custom game modes that players have created that make this game very unique and enjoyable. there is an amazing trade system which allows players to trade items in the game to others that you can carry over to other servers and use. not to mention the rare quality items that are rare that everyone wants, such as unusuals. the team fortress 2 community has even created their own currency for this game! this game uses metal as the main source of money to trade among others. theres just too much to explain about this, youll have to download and play for yourself!",815.0

"for about three years now, ive been a long-time collector of items in team fortress 2, trying to stay on top of new stuff when it comes out. and as frustratingly hard as that sometimes is, i wouldnt trade a minute of it for the world. i say that because team fortress 2 is genuinely one of the most fun experiences ive ever had with a video game, multiplayer or otherwise. im utterly terrible at most video games, but the fun ive had with tf2 makes me forget all of that, and just have fun with it. at its core, the game has a charm to me thats never even come close to dying out. ive met so many good friends and have so many accomplishments thanks to team fortress 2 that this one game has practically changed my entire life. and ill love every minute of its past, present and future until the time the servers shut down; at which point, i will frame my collection as several large pictures, on each wall of my house, as a memento of time well spent.",1561.5

"this is by far the best free to play game ever made. tf2 is more than just a hat simulator. its a hat simulator with guns! no seriously, tf2 is awesome. it features 9 classes which are all needed to make a perfect team. (except for pyro. no one needs pyros). it does have it bad sites because the game is sometimes full of cod kids who only choose pyro and also the medic which is highly needed is very unpopular. most people wont get that its team fortress 2 and not kill everyone on the field fortress 2. also, the trading is a very big part of tf2. so tf2 is very different from shooters like cod, battlefield or halo. i recommend it. highly.",657.3

"the only game were your hat deserves its own hat and your hats hat deserves its on hat",92.4
"reasons why you must get this game (if you dont have it already): 1). its ing free. 2). there is no f2p multiplayer fps that is better than this (fact). 3). really easy to learn and be a pro. 4). its in a colorful cartoon world, how many fps like that do you see? 5). you can customize your loadouts with special weapons hats and stuff. 6). hats 7). almost every steam user have it. 8). large community. 9). you get classes. 10). learn how to spell blu 11). holiday special events are boss 12). lots of new updates. 13). just get it, over!!!",226.0

"this is probably one of my first games i sunk way too much time than i probably needed. this game is one of my favorites, and i have played over a thousand hours into it. i strongly recommend this game as it is one of the most fun and creative fpss i have played. unlike a lot of fpss, it has tons of color and funny elements. all the weapons are balanced for a great experience, so nothing is overpowered. this game is very fun, and free, so there is no excuse not to play it.",1305.2
"its a fun game get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",73.6
"great game, had lots of fun playing it with friends. its great that it isnt a buy to win game. recommending it for people ho play a lot of fps games.",267.3
"the core game is fine, its not p2w, the most important items are dropped via achievements, and the stock items are in many cases the best anyways. what for me destroys the game is the focus on hats or general cosmetic items. for the most part of the community and valve now, its no longer about the gameplay. it really is for many players just the hat simulator #1, and thats just not my thing. i recommend the game regardless, because although the game can be better if they would focus more on the gameplay, its a solid shooter with a good class system and a nice art style.",457.5
"this game is the very best ive been playing it for a long time and im not even the tiniest bit board. this game mixes random with medevil and future kinda stuff. it has alien robots which i call the that cause the music. and 9 classes which are all very unique in personality and game wise. hats, sprays, christmas presents(item find). its amazing! its a amazing game its free?!?!??!?! why is it free?!?!?!! i hope they keep it that way but this game doesnt seem like a free game. 10 out of 10 stars for me.",1661.6
"in my opinion, this is the greatest free-to-play fps out there. provides infinite hours of fun and is a great way to kill some time.",1338.6
"it is really good but ever since the love and war update started the game became conga fortress 2",702.2
"very fun game, recommended to those who never tried it out already! :d",0.2
"lady liked it so i guess its okay just please dont play sniper or spy thanks",1376.0

"this game is just a gift from the gods, its free to play and that makes this game just a masterpiece. youll never bore yourself and its easy to learn. despite the fact that there are a lot of microtransactions, it always is rewarding for what you get. the fan community is a bit awkward because most kids (5-10 years old) want to start this game and think this is cod. this game could be a part of the esports community, but the matches are too short in my opinion. matchmaking works fine and i dont have any more complaints about the game. keep up the good work valve!",323.6
"this game is a fps shooter that has a cartoony feel to it while also obtaining the more than major ctf, control point and a bunch of other game types that you can enjoy playing by yourself or with a freind or entourage of other people. personally i recommend this game not only because its free but its a fun way to waste time while waiting for things and the amount of accessories in this game is absurd but more than fun to collect. ysmir017",125.9
"10/10 would play again (and have so far, many many hours)",341.8
"i was only 9 years old. . . i loved team fortress so much . . . i had all the hats and wepons . . . my dad called me a faget, so i called him a nuub he pwned me . . . i was lying in my bed crying as the tears role down my cheeks i felt i warmth touch me . its the heavy! he whispers in my ear *this is my controll point* he grabs me i want to please him",198.0
"this game possibly hits the greatest multiplayer gaming ever. no matter how fun it is. the hats are actually great to use. blame the people who dont recommend the game. i recommend it because its useful for everything. and its like worms, (because in worms, you wear hats too) thats why. its also amazing how much the game got popular. obviously. its the most amazing game in the world. you now shoot babies and show them, who is crying.",1804.6
"i killed a entire family of four in real life so i could buy steam cards to spend on this game...... 10/10 best game ever",588.0

"one of the best free-to-play fps games of all time",460.7
"i have no life. really. this game sucks balls. but this game is the . id suggest not to play, cause you will forget your life. atleast i have few hats. 11/9 would bang.",100.8
"great game, requires surprisingly little computer grunt for the graphics delivered and a vast system of item drops and crafting to keep you playing that extra 15 minutes past your bedtime. basicly, if you like sentries, guts, explosions, people laughing as you kill them or just plain old bubbles coming out of the back of a rocket you shot at a un-talented spy- this is the game for you. oh yes, almost forgot the best part-----> no hackers! :d so get off your lazy  and into your nice computer chair (doesnt even have to be your chair!) and download team fortress 2.....on your neighbours wifi",403.9
"there are no words to describe how much you should get this game.",40.0
"why the crap are you reading this, and not playing tf2? you got tons of explaining to do man.",131.2
"tf2 is a fun and colorful free to play shooter and offers the most over the top personalitys, gameplay, and humor of any shooter to date. its features 9 classes giving 9 different playstyles and 9 funny personalitys. each class has a weakness as each class can easily outwit the other, giving no op classes. there is a shop in the game so never use it unless its for keys. i would say to look up a guide while playing the game to understand some more mechanics and tips for the game. i cannot explain it all but this game is really nice. i give this a 9.5/10 as some classes, even though not op can get on your nerves. you can run it from any computer as far as in 2007. pick it up now! stop reading this! i told you to scroll up you nice person but rebellious f- ok sorry for that comment, but pick it up. im serious! scroll up! scroll u-",377.6

"this is the best game gabe newell has ever invented.aside from the bugs and glitches,its a game worth playing. thanks gaben",622.4
"this game is really good but the problem is you need to pay something for all the features and blueprints for crafting",691.2
"the best game ever created for several reasons, i will always be a fan",246.1
"ive been playing this for a while now. i really like the in-game drops and that you can communicate and trade wih other friends.",141.6
"it is a very epic game i love it but i have to ply with 270hp because it gets lag with the overs",251.9
"look. its a first person shotter that doesnt give a . its weird,casual and sometimes competetive with friends. however, the maps can become repetetive. but seriously its free to play.",45.8
"get tf2 its balanced and better than other games like bf4 you know, bf4 annoysme to hell but at least the devs team are trying to make that game playable instead of trying to get you to buy hats. and balance isnt a car on one end of the scale and a feather on the other.",72.8
"best point and click adventure game since cod:4 modern warfare",1680.7
"it is a awesome game love it killing ather players is awesome",121.7

"engineer has a leather coat item. 200/10, need i say more?",173.6
"different fps. if youre looking for something like cod, dont bother. new users that typically play cod or halo have a learning curve to get over. the game is very fun and you can sink a chunk of time into it; itll feel like youve been on only for a short time. community is overall a pretty nice one, there are always trolls in every game how ever; not the most toxic community, troll wise but it can be unpleasent at times. overall 10/10 would rail again.",2752.1
"best game ever! gameplay is great, graphics are great, and trading is the bomb! definetly recommend.",343.3

"probably one of the best fps shooter games ive ever played. it has so much in it and its such a comical game. you have got to try it out!",1355.2
"the game was good at first, but now with all the complicated trading aspects put into it, us 1st person shooter game players have been fond of it since 2010",2577.1
"this game sucks. i just buy and sell items i dont play",32.5
"free, multiplayer, in-game trading, its own personal store, play with friends, user-created items, workshop, promotional in-game items, many different maps and ame types, i could go on forever!!!! 5 stars: 11/10 best game evar",889.3
"a great way to kill time... a lot of time. youll find yourself passing hours in what seems like minutes, motivated by the desire to win, get the most points, control the maps, and find rare items. the game isnt pay-to-win by any means; you can get basically everything you need for free, and dont even have to look in the store to enjoy the game. i dont even think my gameplay would be much different if i did buy some things from the shop. 10/10",33.8
"oyus, very much. hey guys, try my roblox version of garrys mod : murder bladexe on roblox",12.0

"this is easily one of my personal favorite games i have ever played. i watched a couple of tf2-related videos on youtube and thought: huh. everyone likes this. i could give it a try, but... what if its like call of duty where its literally the same thing that has already been done thousand times? then, i saw top nine team fortress by fawfuls minion. i was impressed. there was variation, things that werent possible in the real world, no annoying blood effects on your screen when you were hurt. i downloaded steam and the game. despite it eating up a boatload of memory and lots of my time, i didnt regret my choice and will probably never start to regret it.",742.6
"this is the most fun u will have on an fps f2p game....its kinda wierd though but its extremely fun and has non-stop gameplay(if u play it so much) i believe u should get this i rate it a 10/10 perfect!",79.9
"i really like this game and recommend it to all of my good friends on my steam account. except kevin.",31.6
"not the best game in the world but a 100,000,000,000,002 times beest than cod ghosts (infinity ward its clear you suck balls) but tf2 has become well hard to believe better! you dont have to be a heavy trying to kill a enemy medic for half an hour anymore -_-!but be sure to give it a try you also dont need an ace pc to play it!",26.7
"great game but i didnt like how many times it kicked me out of my game . (probaly 6 tops) i like the way it is free though.",29.1

"i have heard this game is funny and really poppular but for some pc players of it like me cant play it cause of some resson so recommend that you should check if the game [i dont car what it is] is a orange box game if it is and its your first orange box game not for grantted that it will work.",0.3

"nothing to say. father of all free-to-play shooters. 8/10",60.2
"werry good game good players fun time play whit frends and werry good grafics",11.2
"this game is diffrent from any other dull fps. the classes feel alive and all have there streghts and weaknesses. you cant quickscope which is great. you have to charge up your shots as sniper. you cant insta kill with a knife, you have to backstab as a spy. overall this game takes alot of practice and strategy. great game!!!",52.9
"this game is probably the reason why i have no tan. 10/10 would buy another hat.",740.2
"as soon as i played this game i couldent stop, its so addictive and fun to play with all your friends. you get to mess around with weponds you wouldent have thought you could fight with. the maps are amazing lots of choises to chose from. the design for the characters look amazing i couldent have imagined then looking any different.",135.3
"a great game with a ton of replay value. i would not call it perfect, but tf2 is a game that will suck you in and waste your life away in the best ways possible. no two rounds of tf2 are the same, so there is always excitement.",2349.7
"team fortress 2 is a great mulitplayer game over all, but with the community getting ruder and ruder over the past few months, i see no reason to play anymore. the hats, guns, keys, etc. make the game even more fun to play. im going to wait for the community to clean out of the jerk offs and maybe i will come back and get some more rares im missing.",58.1

"awesome game! trading is awesome! gameplay is awesome! community is not so awesome d: (12 year olds all day) items are awesome 10/10, would hoard hats again.",1310.6
"a fresh take on the fps-genre. a great way to meet new people. it also encourages teamwork. and the hats, cant forget the hats! no but seriously, tf2 is a great way to spend time. sometimes people take it a little too seriously, though. even if you dont really like fpss (like me) give it a shot (no pun intended). you can play with friends, waste money, and just goof around. its a silly game from time to time, but definately worth awhile. plus its free. 5/5 100%",663.4
"i sold $100 worth of my previous xbox games for tf2 cosmetics and other pro-pain accesories. money well spent.",806.6
"so after about 145 hours of gameplay, ive decided to finally write a review. its fun if youre into fps games, especially non-realistic/modern fps games, plus its free! the only reason to become a premium user is if you want to customize your character or get special items, which in my opinion do not improve gameplay, but you can sell them on the market",144.9
"a very exciting game the intensity is just perfect!",360.2
"10/10 by far one of my most favorite games from here to forever",524.1

"other than recieving one of the highest metascore rating of all time and being a near perfect game, this game is the best you can ever buy, for free! to start, the game is a team based fps that focuses on objective based gameplay rather than straight tdm (although there is that gamemode). now that may sound very unoriginal, but what this game does almost flawlessly is the classes that are present in the game. given nine classes to choose from, the player can adapt their gamestyle at a moments notice, throwing the enemy for a loop or helping the team fill in desperately needed roles. each class has its obvious strengths and weaknesses, with no class being too difficult to kill by any other one. on top of all this, the official maps are also near perfect, with ways around everything but also ways to defend everything, giving the game a nice flow as well as a good challenge. the only downside i can see in this game is some of the community, but like any other game, that should not be held against it.",816.5
"one of the best games i have ever played. a great class based shooter that will always be played. a unique art style and zanny action has earned this game a special place in my gaming library. at 650 hours played i still have fun jumping on wrecking an entire team with the almight sticky launcher",836.9

"this game is very good and i heavily recomend it to anyone looking for a very enjoyable fps.",445.6
"what i like about team fortress 2 is, 1. mvm (mann vs. machine) 2. all the easter eggs and fun stuff you add like the ap-sap is a reference to portal 2. 3. the gameplay itself! what i dislike is, 1. so many hackers, you need to make update the game a little better so hacks arent allowed in any way. like you could make the game where it scans your computer where if there were any type of hack on the tf. file, it would detect the hack and not let you play team fortress 2 unless they deleted the hack. 2. the heavys speed. hes a little too slow but i can see why. the heavy is a large (fat) man. i personally think he is a little too slow. thats all i really can say.",778.3
"i would definately recommend team fortress 2. theres 9 classes to choose from, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and abilities. theres tons of gamemodes, from mann vs. machine (co-op), to capture the flag. its a fast-paced fps game, with lots of action. and on top of all that, its a free to play game (with micro-transactions inside, of course). give it a try, theres nothing to lose!",2180.1

"basically a good first-time-game, if you want to play shooting games. graphics are unique when you compare it to other team vs team games. a big shop with a lot of clothing and free weapons makes the game more interesting, in a way that the users can get creative and style their own characters. nine classes, makes the game more challenging and less boring, as you can just switch class when you feel like it. the videos about the characters and their histories are absolutely terrific, and the medic is something you dont see in every game, as you heal with a medic-gun and shoots with this incredible syringe shooting gun, where in other games its often a character with a medic-back and often with normal (often normal) guns or in use of some type of magic. also is the game always active with players and new products in store. in all is the game catchy and available for everyone. 5/5",278.5
"this game, this game it can be fun, and it can not be. depending on how committed you are in this game i mean if your into trading and you got items and stuff it can be like a business its fun and if you like mvm and tdm and just killing its fun i myself enjoy trading and mvm mu but it doesnt give you the best feeling as in you are fully in the game like other games but this game is really just a silly over done war game so really,you need to download and see, my comment this game",1506.0

"team fortress 2 is a class-based mmofps war-themed hat simulator for the pc and mac. originally it was a faithful recreation of the original quake and half-life mods, but has since evolved from its original design into a pointless virtual collect-a-thon where the player must collect every rare item they can by any means necessary, in order to inflate their ego and show off their e-peen. the original point of the game revolved around playing game modes such as capturing the enemy intelligence, pushing a bomb to the enemy base, or controlling a whole map by scout-rushing control points, but now all this is nothing more than a small minigame to pass the time with while you wait for more weapons and rare items to magically drop into your inventory while doing  all on achievement, trade, idle or non-serious, fun-oriented servers.",36.8

"this used to be such a great game. then it turned into a hat simulator with people spending more time on (getting/building) hats than on actual teamplay. and believe me, this used to be one hell of a first person tactical multiplayer shooter. back when it was still in beta form and shortly after that this used to be the only game i played. the cartoony graphics still look brilliant, and the gameplay is magnificent as well. i only wish they would remove the hats (wishful thinking, i know). the gameplay relies to heavily on teambased gameplay, which is a good thing, believe me, but not when a lot of people are scattered all over the place. you really have to work as a team at times. still, for a (now) free game its pretty much the best thing you can get out there. in the end i would still highly recommend it.

"i used to love this game. i would play it every day, now i just feel like its a waste of my time. sure when you start you get tons of new stuff, after that point you will find yourself spending 10 bucks on an item that does not do anything. after that u will find your self with 10 of that item just from playing. let me get to the worst part it gets so repetative it hurts, not to mention its practicaly an indie game. if you dont like repetative gameplay this game is not for you. sure everyone loves it and owns it but its just another run of the mill class based shooter. im not just saying this because i sucked at it id like to say i was pretty good but it still got repetative.",62.7

"probably the best free-to-play on steam. its got a little something for everyone. want to run around burning stuff? done. want to blast away your enemies? done. maybe sit back and snipe? got it. stealthily dodging enemies and tricking them? can do it. build sentries and teleporters? easy. or maybe heal your teammates and keep them in the fray? my favorite. and if you absolutely must kill everything in front of you, weve got a man and a minigun. i say again, the best f2p on steam!",325.8

"of all the 300 odd games i have, ive played this one more than all the others combined (as of 7/2013), which says a lot about this games quality and replayability. in my opinion its one of the best tycoon games ever, as you work your way up the ladder of hats and unusuals, but instead of earning money proportional to the quality and quantity of your hats, you have to play a cute fps minigame to earn basic items, that you can use to trade your way up to more hats. this is an interesting take on the tycoon formula, but puts more focus on economy and trading, and obviously works well for this game. 10/10, would wear hats again.",484.9
"you die a lot. its fun. tf2 is a fun team based shooter that involves 9 different classes to play as. it has many different maps to play on as well as many different gameplay modes. so there are many strageties you can use in the entire game. the 9 classes are all very unique and well made and thought of. each one giving different gameplay for you to experiment with. dont like competition? play mann vs. machine a coop mode in tf2 based on killing hordes of robots to defend mann co. mann co. is an online store where you use real money to buy hats,weapons, and more! dont have enough money? valve, the makers of tf2, give out free items based on events, achievments, and the amount of time you play the game. and this game is free. so try it, and i hope you like it. overall, i give this game a 9/10",381.5

"a fantastic team based shooter with vibrant classes that all stick out. the mechanics are great and the fact that you need to rely on your teammates to win the game instead of just going crazy with your smg gives the game an interesting twist compared to other fps games. the game feels fair to me with items recently being tweaked in every update to make the game more fun for everyone. every class has their strengths and weaknesses and it makes you learn placement and timing for you to get revenge on that soldier who killed you last life. i genuinely enjoy team fortress 2 and its one of the best made games that ive ever played. hopefully youll be able to enjoy tf2 like i do. edit: eotl killed tf2",2114.3

"after wasting alot of time in this game i decided to write a review. first off the game is great the gamplay is fresh alot to do and alot of nice people to play with. the game has items some like them and some hate them but i dont mind if people waste 100$ on a digital hat or just 0.07$ for a weapon. all weapon have a pros and cons to make the game fair so the people with the most money cant just buy that item. the game is alive and will be for a long time. i would say this game would be worth 19,99$. but its free and everyone can enjoy it free of cost. the game also has mvm (man versus machine) when players fight waves of evil robots to defend man co. so grab a friend and waste money on hats.",237.5

"ive wasted many glorious hours playing this, and i can say ive had one heck of a time. in team fortress 2, youre essentially playing 9 different games at once with the radical gameplay differences each class has, and on top of that the many gamemodes provides even more diverseity to how you play each class, since their role changes depending on the gamemode. it is an unorthodox and first person shooter that continues to break the mold of what a game in the genre can be, and i would recommend it to anyone that, essentially, wants something that is completely different, while still maintaining enough familiarity for those accustomed to the fps genre. effective teamwork, diversity, balanced and fast-paced gameplay; what more could you ask for in a fun-to-play and free-to-play first person shooter like tf2. oh yeah...hats...dont forget about hats...",649.6

"this game so good its should practically become bundled with steam. game is somewhat balanced as of right now-atleast valve tries- and team fortress 2 can supplie with hours upon hours of entertainment weather your the run and gun like most classes or your a more phcological fighter like the spy or you just want to hang back and shoot from a far-sniper-. even if you have bad internet and cant play a multiplayer online shooter, dont worry theres a class for you. the engineer practicaly plays intself so if you built your sentry you dont have to worry about not getting points and you will be helping out your fellow players. there are a varaity of game modes from arena deathmatch to mann vs machine tower defence.",714.5

"its hard to become bored with this game. between the updates, new items, and community based around it, id give tf2 an overwhelmingly positive rating. its competitive, but with a light twist. the personalities of each class definitely contribute to the love as well. it sucks you in, so much so that you begin alienating friends, family, pets, and before you know it youve logged over a thousand hours and youre living behind starbucks in a cardboard box, subsisting on coffee and wifi like a leech. but in your heart you know that it was all worth it, and that everyone and everything not related to tf2 is a distraction keeping you from playing tf2",1096.5

"one of the most addicting game in history. personally, its my favorite game. so what is team fortress 2? team fortress 2 is a multiplayer action-fps game, you play as 9 different classes with different abilities and roles. the fast and speeding scout, the aggressive and rocketjumping soldier, the mysterious and masked pyro, the drunk and explosive demoman, the big russian heavy, the sentrymaking engineer, the lifesaver medic, the headshotting sniper and the backstabbing spy. what makes it addicting and awesome? the gameplay itself needs actual teamwork to complete the objectives and defeat the opposing team. you need to cooperate with your teammates to complete the objectives. besides from that, there are trading features that allows you to trade items like cosmetics, weapons and bunch of other stuff with other players. the community itself is growing and expanding. 10/10 would play again.",1098.2

"i dont see why anyone would not get this game (besides lack of storage space). it is one of the best, if not the best, free game out there. action, fun weapons, teamwork, and awesome, original classes are what make this game so fun. this is a 5 star game.",211.3
"team fortress 2 is a great game with 9 classes of people,and they all have hats shirts weps that are all original to their personality.i play this game alot and i really like it. there alot of friendly people.so, i think everyone should play this awesome game.",493.8
"first of all i want to start by saying team fortress 2 is in my opinion, the best free-2-play game out there. there is such a good community, of couse theres the odd hacker but i guess all games have some hackers that just want to be better than all the rest of us. team fortress 2 has an amazing item list i love all the items in team fortress 2 there are so many to chose and the hats are amazing. customizing classes are so much fun and its so amazing to see the end product. allthough i love this game i feel there should be a story to it, the characters are so cool in their own ways like demoman is a drunk, scout is up himself, spy is classy and no-one knows what pyro is. so i would know that if there was a story it would be amazing. overall i give this game a 9/10 but i would wise for a story valve!",808.4
"if you are looking for a awesome game that may just become your favorite game, you are looking in the right place. tf2 has an amazing community with endless fun! tf2 has countless modes and maps to play with a ton of weapons to choose from to fit your play style. also, with 9 different classes to choose from, each with different rolls, the possibilities are endless. so what are you waiting for, get it now!",898.0
"i shot a demoman in the  and it registered it as a headshot. 11/10.",826.3
"i was slightly disappointed with this game. the amount of money you need to waste to get anything good is appalling. gameplay and game modes are good however i think some of the classes are a bit under powered and compared to other classes they just get destroyed. this game is good for any of you out there who want a good free to play game. i recommend the scout and pyro classes for those of you who lie to rush to the objective and the heavy and sniper classes for a defensive, much slower gamer.",15.9
"definately recommend others play this game, it is ton of fun, awesome classes and weapons!",603.3
"team fortress 2 is a fun and addictive game and im glad its free to play. even though you have to purchase one item in the mann co. store in order to get a premium account, its not a big deal. each class in tf2 feels different and unique which destroys repetition. there are also many different kinds of weapons to chose from. you can also add hats and costumes to your character as you go on. the item drop in tf2 is a good idea except that you get a lot of crates which will force you to buy a key at the store. steam workshop also adds more uniqueness to the classes by people adding more weapons and costumes. one big reason why i like tf2 is because it never gets old. i would highly recommend this game to people especially because it is free-to-play.",600.6

"wonderful game! cartoony, yet still appeals to the more bloodthirsty players. it is the best free to play system i have yet to find, with no way to shoot ahead by paying money. and most of the weapons are balanced, so new players can still feel like they can do as much as someone who has 300+ hours on the game. and it has a extremely large playerbase, who put out just as much if not more content than the developers themselves! its a great game, and not to mention free! the only mistake would be to not try it.",256.8

(2fort) (i started playing when it was quake team fortress back in 99). i enjoy being able to customize my character now with cosmetics because it gives a sense of uniqueness to your character. i enjoy going demoman and decapitating a plethora of players. if you enjoy non-sense, funny dialogue from characters, non-stop mayhem, a very well-balanced game for the most part, doing conga lines, etc. this is the game for you.",2773.1

"what do you think youre doing not playing this i mean come on",921.0
"at the time of this review, i have played about 530 hours of this game. i have enjoyed every second, whether i would prefer to admit it or not. the feeling you get by firing any weapon and getting a kill is enough to go back again and again. unlike counter-strike, the weapons are very cartoonish and the game is just a joke that makes you want to laugh in a mans face when they are pinned against a wall due to an arrow. the animations are, to say the least, hilarious the first time i saw them. i recommend this game for if you have a few hours to kill, or a few people. i also like to land on some peoples head after a rocket jump and make a poop noise. but thats just me. if you like realistic shooters, this game is not for you. if you are used to clicking on people, this game is not for you. if you are an fps player who yearns for something different, this game is defienitly for you. cheers. oh, and there are also a few bugs and hackers too. 9.9/10",668.4

"a game that is worth downloading is defenatley this one. normally i would expect a game like this to have a pricey cost but this is free to play. this game is a stardigizing, sort of fast, contains some comedy, dont rage quit, and be epic. there is alot of basics and theries to over view but it is fun. this game consists of in-game purchases and nine classes. offense - scout soldier pyro | defense - demoman heavy engineer | support - sniper medic spy some classes are difficult to get started with, but soon youll thank valve for creating all of this. thanks for reading this. i highly recomend this game.",524.1

"a solid fps, much more diverse gameplay than most others with its 8 classes. not exactly strategic, but alot of fun and easy to just jump into and kill an hour or two and maybe play with someone else with a mic and then many jokes can be had. items are great too as a way to customize gameplay further than the 8 classes with thousands of weapon combinations, normally after youve given all the classes a play and figured out how to play them; by which point youll have found a few items as drops that you can begin experimenting with.",252.7

"one of the most amazing multiplayer games i have ever played. i never get bored of it. the thought of having 9 different characters to choose from is spectacular. i get bored of playing 1 class? switch to another and play maybe 34 more minuets. then do it over and over. the different weapons are fun to use, and the hats look sexy. very fun game, i highly recommend this to any other fps gamer out there.",1129.9
"before i started tf2, my life was a dark pit fulled with hatless misery every waking moment of the day. the first moment i walked out of spawn on 2fort, i saw a teammate offer me a high five. from that moment on, i knew i was never going to put this game down. 1100 hours and counting later, team fortress 2 fills up the majority of my time, whether its messing around on pubs, trading hats for even better hats, or playing with my highlander team, team fortress 2 is truely the most fun you can ever have with an online game. 11/10 would reccomend",1275.8

"this game is a pretty cool game compared to all the other games this one is my favorite. now this game isnt as much of a fool around type of game its more like a run and gun game, it is very easily paced by one-anothers game strategy or style of playing. if you were a noob you might or might not get dominated by other gamers that have played this game for over a month. like many other players, we start hunting achievements and asking for help but you ask yourself is this fun? hell no! grab your self a drink and have fun woth it dont hunt for acievements! thats boring, unlike cod, bf3, or any other shootin game made by drunk people in companies (jk) this game allows custom customiztions like hats, miscs, and game changing weapons! each weapon has its own potential, except for weapon reskins, each have many effects such as the baby faces blaster! i would definetly give this a 10/10! recommended to all gamers!",786.1

"this is my favorite game. and its f2p everyone should try this, not everyone will like this. just dont play it like cod or bf. here you have to teamwork, learn about classes, and train yourself. 9 diffrent classes, from slow but powerful heavy, to spy which can instantly kill all characters, except for bercharged ones. graphics in this awesome game, is very good (for me), even for now. thanks to the retro style, this games graphics arent getting older at all. the game have some annoying elements like mann.co store, or some bugs. but its too much fun, to paying attention to that. bestgameever(i havent play gta v so it can change)/10 and a one more thing: when you are starting playing that dont choosedemoman/sniper/heavy at first. solider for first times is better. the m,ost powerful class is spy. but its hardest so dont play it for first time.",439.6

(i dont really like half life 2) as well as that it has many maps different game types and best of all hats!!! and lots of other items. you can trade, craft, sell, etc also you have the occasional server that has a community map and game like jailbreak or: dodgeball, the most common is saxton hale. all this is awaiting to entertain you for hours, so download it now! join us all in team fortress 2",728.3

"this is my favorite game using the source engine, yet a lot of team fortress veterans see this as the crapiest version of teamfortress. this game has so many hats, genuine, unique, and yes the really cool ones unusual hats(which are the hats with things or a thing spinning around from the hat). this game never gets old, and really doesnt when i make my own maps using the hammer engine. there are over 1,000 items to choose from. so get this game, i mean its free to play! download it now! and is way better than any call of duty game, which is gay! but, yet a lot of pc gamers see this as the trash of valve. i mean the graphics are descent, but are not like counter-strike source or even global offense, instead its cartoonish graphics. the graphics could be better, and as well as the level design; theres barely any prop_physics, but hey, its a lot more fun than most fps and mmo games out there for pc.",975.2
"tf2 is the ultimate free to play game for pc gamers. instead of just any team death match like on any other shooting game there is a task to complete to make it more exciting and interesting! in my perspective, even noobies have a shot at dominating the pros. it starts you off with well balanced items and other items you can find randomly. you can get them by buying them but this is better for people who dont want to spend money. great gamplay, love it.",1283.6

"an amazing game i would recomend this game to everyone and just keep playing you will get weapons",884.7
"an economical simulator which will make you want to pay to look cooler than everyone else and will make you want to spend more time to be better and make people rage. blaming on teammates and your computer are also included as well in the package and you get to meet some rare species such as the vocal commands spamming dude, the guy calling everybody a noob and of course the 9 year old kid who needs to talk constantly. you will find very balanced skilled-classes like the mini sentry engineer and the sticky spamming demoman. overall a pretty mediocre game, would definitely recommend.",1245.0

"60s-70s action movie feeling? sounds badass! an eye-catching exceptional graphical style resembling somewhat pixar-esque? fascinating. lots of gratuituous ,graphical and humourous violence? oh yes! gameplay, which emphasises teamwork and is most fun when you man up with your mates - in addition giving a big middle finger for the opposing team by showing them how their collective effort sucks compared to your valuable, well-forged plan? hell yeah! its team fortress 2! even though it lacks the charm of grenades and insane leet tricks which you were able to perform in team fotress and tfc (my old love~), the tf2 works as a brilliant spiritual successor for its grandfather games i loved to play too. get your hands on it - try it out, and see if you like it or not - for its free!",1407.8

"by golly has this game come far. i have played this game from previous accounts and it has come a long way my friends but lets get on with the review! team fortress 2 is an fps. even though that word is slightly tainted, tf2 (team fortress 2) is an amazing game plus its free so even if you dont like it you can stop playing straight away without the anger that you spent money. by the way this game makes f2p actually look good! now lets get straight to the main pros and cons pros: addictive highly charismatic characters and enviroments great(ish) community not trying to force you to buy anything unlike most f2ps mods and plugins coming out the wazoo cons: hats and miscs changed many peoples view on the game rarley updated anymore some people rather trade then play the game overall id say 8/10 good job valve",296.8
