"funnest thing since sliced bread! play it and enjoy a cartoony personality filled fps... in multiplayer!",657.1
"this game is awesome. im sure you will love this game. best thing is that the game is free2play. for me personally would be better if game had some leveling system, so you could progress and get some bonuses. anyway if you didnt played this game, do it now! 10/10",19.4
"one of the best free-to-play game out there and one of the best multiplayer experiences! incredibly well balanced and very fun, especially when exploring the abilities of each class. both the co-op and the versus modes are incredibly fun and unique in their one way. i highly recommend it! edit: i disagree with those saying the game is pay to win: all weapons can be found in game through playing. the only items that cannot be found with a free to play account are cosmetics such as hats and accessories",519.5
"awesome game. it is easy to learn and play. the funnest free game you will ever play on pc",32.9
"i like this game, i would also like some free items pls",1.2

"this is an awesome game with potentially years of fun within. a great time waster and multi-player game to play with friends. tons of customization for the 9 great and varied characters who suit to anyones taste in characyers, whether you like the stay at the back, picking off enemise from a distance sniper character or the all up in your face, bullet raining monstrosoty of the heavy, this game caters to all of your needs. 10/10",47.4
"team fortress 2: probaly my selected favorite of the year, choose from 9 playable classes with there own uniqe loadouts (witch are customizable), and personalities, play as either blu (builders laugue united) or red (somthing something demolition) in pursuit of capture, or play mann vs machine in this co op moed it will be you and your friends against waves and waves of robots who are trying to take over, i highly reccomend it as it is now free to play",568.4
"you join the game with one purpose... to earn yourself some sweet hats. so what do you do? you pwn noobs for hats you play with 12 year olds for hats you pay thousands of dollars for hats you rack up countless hours just grinding and grinding.... all of this you will do for your grand quest of owning all the hats. will you succeed? probably. but theres one thing i know for sure. youll absol- spy sappin mah sentry!",256.8
"my god this game is addicting, and great fun! of course valve just keeps spewing out great games. tons of stuff to unlock, balanced mp despite all of the different and unique classes, a great co-op mode known as man vs machine, and of course a lot of fun game modes. this games offers so much and the fact its free is amazing! the artsit theme is kind of unique for an fps looking very cartoonish, one other game that has the theme can be borderlands. also great with friends! the trade feature is great. then again no story in a great fps ( well one that is barly of any intrest ) and no campain! this is definetly not the best fps ever, infact not even in the top 10 but because of the value it gives and that its free has to get recomended! i give this game a for sure 9 out of 10! amazing valve, amazing!",62.8
"this game is sooo much fun to where you can play for hours straight. so much content and better with friends.",545.1

"one of the best free-to-play fps games of all time",460.7
"fun game, built from the ground up with community in mind. i wholeheartedly say that this game may b one of the best multiplayer fpss of all time. however, now it may be switching into a full-scale economy game, complete with products to sell, servers built to get you them, and servers built to sell them.",1466.8

"one of my favorite games. its lots of fun with 9 classes each with multiple weapons providing many different styles of playing, but (mostly) remaining balanced. the characthers are funny and likable and the game despite the violence has a cartoony and fun atmopshere. even after going f2p the devs keep releasing more content several times each year.",427.5
"go on a killstreak, get killed by a gibus pyro. waste money on hats. ruin your life, become an addiction. get frustrated when 10 year olds scream on microphone. brilliant. 10/10",819.1
"team fortress 2 is an amazing game downloaded it a while ago and never got round to playing it due to school exams, love the graphics, content and items. would recommend to anyone to try out and have some fun.",70.3
"if u like hats and being a spycrab then this is for you. it was orginally called hat simulator but then they realized that they wanted to add shooter elements 10/10 would pyro again",26.1
"this mostly f2p game is one of the best experiences from valve out there. full of references, jokes, sanviches, and of course, hats. there are so many different things you can do. feeling a bit bored of playing against players? try mvm and fight some robots! want an interesting challenge? try the halloween bosses. they offer an interesting take on koth and cp maps, as well as the scream fortress 2014 doomsday map. if you like trading, there are so many trading servers. overall, a 4/5 experience. id rate it a perfect 5 but there are so many things that can get overall annoying at times. mainly, mvm tour players and their requirements. a great (mainly) f2p game with an awesome community.",603.0
"tf2 is the best fps game out there and its better then cod",2617.7
"who the  doesnt want to play a game with hats! i mean its ing hats for christ sakes!!! 9/11",200.8
"this is the best f2p i have ever played in my life hands down!",640.1
"the no.1 steam sorce for hats, or memes.... or meems........ or pootis...... or (yeah this would go on forever so im stopping it now) 10/10 would poot again",1794.5
"this game is awesome because of trading (i prefer trading rather than playing but playing is interesting too) its so good to just go and trade and make profit but there is a minus that the keys price is tf2 is too high i think valve need to create new keys or something i dont know how to fix the price of keys i recomend valve to try to play tf2 trading itself and see problems with it but i would recomend this game because its like trading game and fps game put in one game last thing i almost forgot that they should make paint drops for f2p more often because its the only tradable drop for f2p so yea",586.3
"best  game of 1990 - ign 11/10 runescape has better graphics then this . it take 99999999 gb to download even tho there is barely any content. everyone on mic is 5 or younger. you get 1 item every 500 hours. a virtual hat costs more then a real hat. combat is somehow even faster paced then cod. would gladly uninstall again.",76.6
"one of the best games i have ever play.its funny, has a big variety of maps, a lot of gamemodes and one important thing is that it is free 9/10",21.9
"this game is amazing 10 out of 10 steam really out did itself",305.1
"after easily 600 hours of game time and fun and leaving it on. this game is still the best f2p game out there, capable of competing with famous games such as cod: ghosts and battlefield 4. the fact that all the 9 mercenaries are so well rounded and none is overpowered in any sort of way makes it challenging to veterans and novices alike not to mention the communtiy mode creating system which allows players to create their very own game mode and maps, giving an experience like no other, furthermore, you can model your own weapons and hats and miscellaneous to your own liking and post it on the steam workshop for others to review and possibly get into the game. all in all, this game nevers fails to deliver, always keeping you playing different game modes from prop hunt to dodgeball and all that shizz. if you are looking for a game that will last you years to come, team fortress 2 is the game for you",686.2
"brilliant game and cannot get enough of it if only they implemented competitive within the game this game would explode onto the comp community alongside cs:go",2559.8
"its a great first person to play its just a game where you can have fun every class has its pros and cons but if you know how to play that class your going to have a great time!",1972.7
"a game where hats get more attention than the acctual gameplay. and people who wield golden frying pans are gods. 10/10, would waste a vast majority of my life to stare at virtual hats and slay weak humans with a fish.",1570.9
"excellent online game, it has hours and hours of endless fun with its humour and its fast pace. this is an original classic that will still be around in 5-10 years time.",16.4
"great game that provides endless enjoyment and laughter so hard you will cry.",148.4
"its like someone activated the yu-gi-oh card toon town on a counter strike game.",534.4

"great, a fantastic first person shooter, amazing lore, great game to be honest with you, lots of skills required, 9 mercenaries, cartoon look, all those together? amazing. team fortress 2 right there for you.",466.6
"great game, id say nice people, but that isnt always the case. i know valve is trying all they can to make tf2 a better, safer experience, but itd really help if they added some sort of, kick-from-tf2 thing. to give hackers a better idea of what will happen if they keep doing what theyre doing. i like the hats, keeping in touch with my friends, but most importantly, i love the unique-ness. most free to play games are not entirely invigorating, but team fortress 2 breaks that line. team fortress 2 is the best free to play game i know, being it has great community, makes great animation partnered with source film-maker, and most importantly gives me something to say to others, yes. i play team fortress 2. got a problem? i am a proud player of the game.",1869.1
"amazing game, i found myself addicted to playing it. although some people might not find this game apealing, its still a great game for most people. it is also good if someone is just making there first steps into the great world of first person shooters",294.2
"i give this game credit for being the only game i know which can make grown men have an orgy over hats 10/10",109.8
"i spend more money on virtual hats than i do on real life hats. 10/10",1305.4

"when i started this game it was a simple, fun, fps but i started playing alot and got really good. then i got a message from a valve ceo saying if i didnt delete tf2 they would shut down my steam account. so now i no longer have tf2. i cant believe the audacity of these peopl! but i now get all the games for free so... ~my 1992 apple/10",71.5
"wasted 1800 hours of my life and counting 10/10 would reccommend",2043.3
"very good game. good game good times with good friends.",76.2
"an mothering rocket launcher is worth 2 cents an random hat is worth 10 cents the same hat but on fire is 10 trillion cents best gaem 2015 period-would waste my lunch money for weapons covered in solid piss color again",676.4
"not the gamer to like shooting? team fortress 2 now doubles as a hat simulator!",415.9
"tf2 ftw! download it! do not resist! it is the best fps i have played, and its free!!!",471.9
"a fun game for people who like fps not call of duty like, a good class based game where the objetive isnt to kill everything on the screen its to cap points or dpush carts or a whole lot more.",848.7
"the best shooter for massive blattles very fun esta de huevos este shooter de lo mejor para batallas masivas",548.2

"i love this game 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 thats how much i love it",13.1
"team fortress 2 is extremely fun and entertaining! there are many servers to play on to play different types of tf2. the controls are easy and the graphics are pretty good. there are many different characters to play as, and every character is different. team fortress 2 is a great game to get and the best part is that it is free! i definitley reccomend this game!",71.9
"team fortress 2 is in my opinion the best fps game ive ever played. heres why. it has 9 classes to choose from (heavy, medic, sniper, ect.), lots of gamemodes (capture the flag, control points, ect.), humorous voicelines for each of the classes, lots of weapons that you can find at random, and of course, hats to customize your characters. oh, and did i mention its free? i highly recommend this to anyone who likes fps games.",681.1
"awesome game. one that will outlast other first shooter games",720.5
"great game for beginners (that havent played cod)",280.1
"cried my eyes out when it lagged. highly recommended.",28.9
"this was a great game few years ago, but now its filled with  updates and players. no new weapons, but weapon balance updates everynow and then that just makes them overpowered or underpowered. the new players are often idiots and is toxic to the community. this game used to make funny jokes here and there, but now it is a joke with new dumb taunts and hats. pros +a good f2p model +great gameplay cons -unbalance with every update - updates -toxic community -lost its charm",1951.6
"a different fps multiplayer shooter than everyone makes. hours and hours of gameplay with many different ways to play. each gamemode is different and 9 classes that can be customized to have different play styles and mann vs machine. from throwing jars of pee at people, to slapping them with ham team fortress 2 has many different items to use. and its free!",105.4
"a game like no other. with a friendly community and crazy mechanics, you will soon find that you are not whole without hats. an awesome game. and i think that you are all dancing babies really just says it all",482.9
"g8 m8 i r8 8/8. seriously though, this is a amazing game. great dev throughout, amazing people on servers and hillariously good jokes all around. if you thought the tf2 community was bad, look at call of dutys community, pure ing poison cooking.",260.0
"yeah screw valve and their free game, theyre not getting any of my free money",723.0
"free to play, pay to win. still lots of fun though.",206.7
"fun, but some items are too expensive. team fortress 2 is more like the next business exchange.",1021.4
"its got everything you want in a game. -violence. -big guns. -science. -cheesy one-liners. -a russian. -an omnipotent female voice always telling you what to do. but most importantly...it has hats. mother. ing. hats. play it.",41.9
"i play this game a lot with my friends and this is perfect for chilling or if you want, you can go full on try hard too!",171.2
"i recommend this game to people who like to earn cool stuff and have fun on servers you love",111.7
"definitely worth playing,especially if you enjoy a fps game that have many roles to be played and strategy.",48.5
"what kind of fps are you? do you like to run in and kill? fly and shoot lethal rockets to blow up buildings and players? burn everything in front of you? if so, those are just 3 out of 9 classes with their own unique roles and stratergies. this game can use stratergies such as the use of sticky bombs or turrets or can just be a rush in and destroy everything with a minigun and a knife. has many gamemodes for the players desire and many weapons that can change the battlefield and is free to play. there is nothing to lose except all the time youll be using to play this game!",372.3
"really fun free fps game with a great interactive comunity",711.5
"this game is my pc world 688 hours right now spent in this game and let me say every one worth it next goal is 1k hours ;) all the brilliant times ive had during this game whether im going lone wolf or with friends i will always enjoy my time on this game would definitely advise playing this game even if you dont want to get premium and stick to f2p account the fun is still endless and unlimited throughout my entire 3 years of playing this game i never expected to endup with my backpack being worth around over 200 xd, crazy i know!",721.3
"hats. hats everywhere. so many hats and other cosmetic items that its pretty much impossible not to find a combination you like. also, enough weapons to find a way of killing your opponents that suits you. 9 classes, each with a unique set of weapons, a fairly realistic personality, and lots of cool hats to wear. so much extra content (official comics, etc.) that lets you get an incredibly in-depth look at the games story and the backstory of each class. overall, i give tf2 a hat/10 best game ever, play it now.",711.8
"tf2 is one of the best games i ever played!!! definetly get it! its free!!!!!!!! 11/10",440.6
"this game is the reason i started pc gaming; it is also the reason i am still into pc gaming.",856.2

"if you have a computer and youre able to download steam, why havent you downloaded this game yet? this is probably my favorite valve games made and one of my favorite games ever. in the game, if youre tired of doing one thing, there is going to be somethig different always. this is a game with a lot of action elements and can be hilarious at times. oh, did i mention this game has hats?",1083.2
"bought unusual for 50 keys. the next day the price went to 30 keys. 10/10 would  myself over again,",671.7
"no words are needed. its free, fun and has a great community. did i mention free? this game give you hours on hours of enjoyment for nothing at all in return. what are you waiting for?",2298.6
"i wouldnt really fully recommend this to any old school gamer, but for free its one of the best games ever. valve have done an amazing job making their games available free to play for all, with premium access to the orange box buyers, so now valve can bring in lots more players that werent previously aware of their awesome games. only problem i find with it is most of the community, and the unseriousness of the gameplay. the hats, the items, they just dont do it for me. tfc was all about teamwork, shooting, and plain seriousness. whereas with tf2, its all just joking, cartoon-y, hats, items, trading...you get the point. i like the game, and i still recommend it to everyone, but its just not for me.",253.1
"well then im not going to list off the things i like and hate about this game end of the line update, but im just going to say that team fortress 2 ed up......",610.8
"this game is probably the best game ive ever played. its confusing once you first play it, but its very easy to learn. i guarantee youll be hooked if you play this game for a little while.",1456.3
"this game is really good because you can play in many varying ways. as a spy you could be sneaky. if you like to be a support you could always play as a medic and heal injured teammates. if you wanna be a bit tanky, though you will probably need a medic to be in the frontlines of a fight, you could play as a heavy and kill everybody with your minigun. if you like being fast and capture points and the intelligence fast you will be playing as the scout. theres other classes such as sniper, pyro, soldier demoman, and engineer. another great thing is that you can find new weapons to play differently. definitely recommend, hell i would give the game 10/10!",423.4
"why the f*ck i cant sell my $hitty hats on the market? i have like 25 games, ing flying s steam.",398.9
"great game!!! one of the main reasons people joins steam, i know i did beacuse of tf2!!! if you havent already you must try this!!!",516.8
"this game killed the idea of being bored no legit this game went to the house of bored and burnt him with a lemon and then fed him to the pyro and this game threw the pyro in the enemies base but then the game burnt the enemie base with the enemie pyro. true story i saw this with my own eyes",186.2

"great game!so much content!holiday theme maps and items, and so much more.",7.3
"this is proably the best game ive ever played. ive played other shooters like battlefield and cod but none have been as well crafted or balanced as tf2. its called team fortress for a reason you really have to work as a team or you will be destroyed by your enemies, each class has its own strenghts and weaknesses and you have to factor that in. the gameplay is smooth, fun and addictive. my social life has died after i bought this, the only way my friends contact me is via steam or throwing bricks with notes attached to them through my window. i love the classes the maps and most importantly the hats. i find it amazing and awesome updates are still coming out for this game , even though it was released in 2007. there is a constant stream of new maps, guns and most importantly hats. 7 years of hat themed fun. 10/10 go download it, its awesome.",554.5

"this game is a fps shooter that has a cartoony feel to it while also obtaining the more than major ctf, control point and a bunch of other game types that you can enjoy playing by yourself or with a freind or entourage of other people. personally i recommend this game not only because its free but its a fun way to waste time while waiting for things and the amount of accessories in this game is absurd but more than fun to collect. ysmir017",125.9

"probably in the top 10 for my favorite games of all time easily. so many modes, some fun mods... well structured classes with their own deep backstories. humorous. not to mention that the balance and diversity of weapons is great. no overpowered weapons. trading in this game adds a whole new dimension for some people. i dont trade for profit anymore. why not give it a shot? its free. if you take a liking to it i would highly reccommend going premium. i didnt go premium until i hit 200 hours though. it was definetly worth the 49 cent investment. definetly. i later went on to play competitive tf2, which i found increasingly fun compared to the pubs in which i was dominating the rest of the server. i think valve should add a match making/ rank system in tf2. it would really help the game garner more attention as an e-sport. i think the problem is that with out these built in features, few people know about competitive at all. plz valve plz i give it a pineapple out of a guava",1115.3
"what can be said that hasnt already? it doesnt take itself too seriously, between its humor and graphic style, which not only makes your failure less intense but brings in a lot more women players than youre used to seeing. the classes play styles change significantly when you equip different gear. and the gear is never just better or higher level: it always has penalties equal to its bonuses, meaning everyone is always on equal footing. its free, but you can buy hats if you want. you wont at first. but you will. youll end up buying lots and lots of hats with real money.",30.0

"out of all the dress-up sims i have ever played this is by far the worst. theres only two uniforms you can wear, blu or red. the only redeeming quality of this dress-up sim is the plethora of hats one can equip to their avatar. unfortunately in order to do this, one has to stand around doing nothing for hours on end with the chance of even finding one of these hats. one thing the creators of this game may want to consider is the ability to at least swap clothing between the different characters one can choose for their avatar. that really really big man would look much better in the suit on the scrawny guy, who in turn would look much better with a nice bowler or something instead of a sock on his head. all in all i give this game a 4/10.",948.0

"this is the most stupidly fun game ever made. whether youre casually playing on a valve server, playing competitively, messing around in some crazy game mode on a privately hosted server, or trading, youre going to have a lot of fun. the only negative thing about this game is the name. a much more appropriate name would be hat simulator. because that, my children, is the true purpose of this game. to buy, sell, and collect hats. big hats to small hats, common hats to unusual hats, medieval hats to robot hats, sexy hats to physically revolting hats... hats that fill you with joy, and hats that leave you traumatized for life. 11/10 would collect more hats. oh yeah, and theres also these things called strange weapons...",782.2

"you can blow yourself up to fly, then land on some dudes head and hit them with a frying pan to kill them. then, you can give your teammate a high five over the dudes corpse and then try to drink from the handle of the pan like its a bottle, all while wearing a hat thats on fire. why would anyone not love this game?",912.5

"review: if you like a cartoony animated fps, then this is your dream game. it has good gameplay and the classes have their own strengths and weaknesses which makes gameplay very unique. also the classes are made to work together to win a match. my most favorite part of team fortress 2: the halloween event is my favorite part of tf2, its all crazy and very funny when you play on the halloween event maps. but the downside is that you can only play the halloween event around the time of halloween. i also like the unique classes what i dont like about team fortress 2: i think the prices on many items in the shop are outrageous. they should also have more weapons instead of many more cosmetics. also, there needs to be a more secured vac (valve anti-cheat) system because i have been in games where the hacker doesnt take any damage, i have played with at least 26 hackers in my entire time playing this game. rating: 8.2 / 10 really good",143.8

"this game has been around for almost 7 years might go for its tenth year and i could see why. what i like about this game is how well its balanced, not just in weapons but in the classes themselves. every class and its gun has its up and downs. no sense of it being a pay-to-win game. cheapest gun is low as 0.49 cents and as i said before alot of the guns are fairly balanced. oh yeah you cant forget about the hats... hats hats hats!!!!! you can customize your charactor with whatever apperal or hats. whether you wanna make look badass or just flat out stupid the choices are yours. some people could say that hats are killing the games. alot of the updates has just hats and it could be annoying, buts the hat could go either way. the hats has open up a new world for tf2 but there is more hats then there is guns. but i could see why its pretty hard to make a gun that is fairly balanced. so i would say this game gats a 9/10",175.3

"i totally recommend this game to anyone interested. tf2 is a first person shooter... kinda. this game can involve wacky shenanagins, like bumper cars, giant strongman games, silly cosmetics, and watching really bad players. what i really like is that you can get almost a full experiance with the free to play option, with only some crafting, trading, and inventory space being limited. the only downsides to this game are the cost of some items, like keys and paints, and the glitches. oh the glitches. although sometimes funny, they can be a real hassle. there are times when you cant join games, have trading errors, are unable to turn or quite, and can only swing your current weapon, glitches caused by using the chat, and anything along those lines. overall though, this game can be a lot of fun for people of many ages.",841.8

"great game. another game where you have to apply teamwork to achieve the goal. unlike many other warfare games, you cant just rush into the battlefield and get #1 on the leaderboard. you might be able to do this, but it s only helping you and not your team. each class has their own fun, creative, and interesting personality and styles. any of these ranging from a german mad scientist, all the way to a mysterious pyromaniac that no one really knows much about. its overall an amazing game. theres hundreds of different game modes, communities, maps, and much more. youll never get bored (i mean.. you might)! graphics are pretty sweet, characters are fun and enjoyable to play as and of course, is probably one of the best red vs. blue stories ever.",172.7
"lots of fun, just be open to learn new tactics and playstyles",918.0
"good game. i dont think it has become what the devs dreamed it to be. a beautifully designed game with fun and hilarious content, home of veterans of shooters and new soldiers. sadly, people take the opportunity to play this wonderful game for granted. people seem to use this game for cyberbullying, online insults, and hacking. dont take my words wrong, though. this isnt what the devs wanted. no, this game is amazing, just misused. as a 9/10 in my book, this game is fun, friendly, and just plain crazy. not for everyone, but the approach they took was smart. not only putting in snipers, heavies, and scouts, they added the unusual characters known as the engineer, the spy, and the demoman, doing something most games dont. as i say once more, it is a fun game that is highly reccomended by many.",1111.1

"this game so good its should practically become bundled with steam. game is somewhat balanced as of right now-atleast valve tries- and team fortress 2 can supplie with hours upon hours of entertainment weather your the run and gun like most classes or your a more phcological fighter like the spy or you just want to hang back and shoot from a far-sniper-. even if you have bad internet and cant play a multiplayer online shooter, dont worry theres a class for you. the engineer practicaly plays intself so if you built your sentry you dont have to worry about not getting points and you will be helping out your fellow players. there are a varaity of game modes from arena deathmatch to mann vs machine tower defence.",714.5
"this game is one of the best games ive ever played. valve created this game from tfc(team fortress classic) and i have to say they have improved so  much its insane (example:magikarp evolved into gyrados) it has an awesome story to and its freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee to play so go ahead and get it you wont regret it",508.2

"this is an amazing game, the many classes (9) to chose from adds so much to this game. scout, soldier,pyro,demoman,heavy,engineer,medic,sniper and last but not least spy. all of them have very diffrent gameplay which is a very great thing about this game. not just that you can get differnt weapons and change your set up, i would tell you how many, but there so much to name so ill just put it in simple words my god there is a s**t tone of weapons! anyways... there is a thing even a none fan should know about this game. hats,hats,hats and more hats if not hats it body cosmetics or just pricey weapons(youll lrean more about this if you get it i promise.) there are many sharks so i suggest you get a simple... thing... called scrap.tf its made by valve (the makers) so its virus free... and i have to much to say to wrap this up fast ill just say get this game!

"as a long-term team fortress player (i used to play a lot of tfc and even had the quake mod back in the day), this is unsurprisingly one of my favourite valve games. since its release, there have been a heap of new weapons added in the game, which are available as randomly given items while playing, along with hats (most of which have absolutely no effect on gameplay, but are valued highly by players). admittedly, there are a few elitist players because the games been out so long, but if youre a fan of team-based fps games then *definitely* give it a shot.",2291.7

"the core game is fine, its not p2w, the most important items are dropped via achievements, and the stock items are in many cases the best anyways. what for me destroys the game is the focus on hats or general cosmetic items. for the most part of the community and valve now, its no longer about the gameplay. it really is for many players just the hat simulator #1, and thats just not my thing. i recommend the game regardless, because although the game can be better if they would focus more on the gameplay, its a solid shooter with a good class system and a nice art style.",457.5

"team fortress 2 used to be a game. i know thats hard to understand for many of its current players but its true. back when it came out it was a simple, yet well made team based shooter. hats were something old people wore and people paid for the gameplay rather the looks. those were the times. nowadays tf2 is an economy where thousands of dollars change hands every day as people quest for those rare items that will set them apart of the rest. real life money and other games are exchanged for cosmetic items based on rarity rather than function and valve is making money by the truckload. on one hand i want to congratulate them for this utterly brilliant business model that has truly made them a power to behold. on the other hand i cant help but worry that well start seeing more and more games where gameplay is secondary to various forms of dlc and micro-transactions, where people play, not for the game, but for the hope of making money.",2483.2

"this is a reveiw ive been holding off for some time now; but here it is and here are my personal thoughs of the game. let;s start with the good things, shall we? graphics, gameplay, music, maps, characters, (most) items and community are all either good or fanastic. the maps and gamemode keep me playing and just the silly humor of te game adds that special charm to the game. now, probably the one and only bad thing about this game. it gets boring... really fast. i can play a few rounds a day, but thats it! i get so bored so fast it kills the game for me. now, dont get me wrong, i love this game, and for gods sake, its free! but i find it lacking sometimes. the updates are ussually really good! take the love and war update for example. anyways, i seriously enjoy this game a ton, but its not my favorite. final score: 8.75/10 conga taunt: 99999/12",409.8

"team fortress 2 is probably one of my favorite online multiplayer games. the reason being because of all the cool and fun weapons and loadouts you can mess with. there are nine different classes to choose from depending on your play style. in my opininon soldier is the class i would start out with since he does a good ammount of damage, great mobility and good ammount of health. he gives new players a idea of what to do so they can progress and keep learning different strategies. in this game they also have the very popular hats and of course trading. you can also purchase keys from the store and unbox things from the crates you get as drops. most of the time youll get whats listed as the crate says but if you get really lucky you might unbox and unusual and have a hat with one of many effects they have. this game being free so there isnt a reason at least not to try.",2164.9

"team fortress 2 is a class-based mmofps war-themed hat simulator for the pc and mac. originally it was a faithful recreation of the original quake and half-life mods, but has since evolved from its original design into a pointless virtual collect-a-thon where the player must collect every rare item they can by any means necessary, in order to inflate their ego and show off their e-peen. the original point of the game revolved around playing game modes such as capturing the enemy intelligence, pushing a bomb to the enemy base, or controlling a whole map by scout-rushing control points, but now all this is nothing more than a small minigame to pass the time with while you wait for more weapons and rare items to magically drop into your inventory while doing  all on achievement, trade, idle or non-serious, fun-oriented servers.",36.8

"wow a shooter that looks like it was in a nintendo carwash! team fortress 2, this has been incredibly popular on steam ever since it debut in 2007. the game is completely different than your ordinary shooter. firstly, this game is colorful. in most shooters its all hardcore and gray. but in tf2, it is the complete opposite of that. it has humor, good writing, an amazing community, different game modes, over 200 (i think) weapons, and so much more. so, if you are new to steam and are looking for a good shooter, pick tf2. because its totally different than the run of the mill call of duty fps. and its also free to play! so you get one of the best games on steam for free, and if you want a premium account all you have to do is just buy 1 item from the shop! and going premium adds a whole new layer of fun to team fortress 2. so please if you havent already, play this game. its fresh, its new, and its different. and i dont expect it to go off steam anytime soon",1215.4

"this game is extremely well made, a damn fine example of how in depth you can go with a class-based fps. tf2 dabbles in a little bit of everything; besides the base game, you can also find a range of community servers that offer unique experiences, and also about 1.4 billion minecraft trade servers. but the great thing about this game is its personality. the classes arent just faceless people who generically fit their role, each class has a personality and a backstory, given in the impressive amount of tf2 lore through comics and videos. the f2p aspect means youre able to try the game, and if isnt for you, just quit it, you havent lost a single thing. the claims that this is the best f2p game out there. if i had to note a problem with this game, its my addiction to it, and the fact that its cost me well over 100 dollars at this point from in-store purchases to get into the in-game market 10/10 god damn, i dont know what else i would give a game ive wasted over 1,700 hours of my life in.",2233.5

"i totally recommend this game to anyone interested. tf2 is a first person shooter... kinda. this game can involve wacky shenanagins, like bumper cars, giant strongman games, silly cosmetics, and watching really bad players. what i really like is that you can get almost a full experiance with the free to play option, with only some crafting, trading, and inventory space being limited. the only downsides to this game are the cost of some items, like keys and paints, and the glitches. oh the glitches. although sometimes funny, they can be a real hassle. there are times when you cant join games, have trading errors, are unable to turn or quite, and can only swing your current weapon, glitches caused by using the chat, and anything along those lines. overall though, this game can be a lot of fun for people of many ages.",841.8

"as far as first person shooters go, tf2 has a far greater in-depth experiance than any other ive played. its focusses on team work (no? realy?) and class matchups. think rock, paper, scissors, with 9 different choices, all with an advantage against some and a weakness to others. team balance is key. with loads of weapons to customise and adapt your characters, and hats to glam-up with, if you facy a fps thats more than just a bunch of guys shooting the same people, an actual team game, this is it.",493.7

"if there is anything to team fortress 2 is how impressive and repeatative it is for new players and veterans at this game. people always come back for a little more than what they intentionally wanted from a free game, and it delivers. valve has created a game based on the principles of character custimization, user interface, and profittable material, all in the name of the user. no other game so far has given this amount of freedom to anyone, and has surpassed expectations of what games could become. and while the game lacks detailed maps and graphics expected from newer games today, it is important to realize that the story, mechanics, and community of a game matter much more than some fancy particle effects, such as starcraft 1 compared to cod series. i highly recommend supporting community made content and play this with your friends. if there is anyone who has never heard of steam or tf2, they should absolutly try this first. enjoy this great game.",619.1

"fun addictive, great gameplay and just downright cool game. though i must say i wish it was easier to find weapons and other cosmetic items but once you become a premium member im sure thats no longer an issue. i personally hope that they add a new character to the game something like the engineer where he can place down support, but without the permanant effect but the trade off is his is stronger in some way.",134.9
"tf2 is probably one of the best and funniest games ive ever played. it got many game modes and servers and its always a game that you and youre friends can play for hours together. i recommend tf2 for everyone who likes good fps games with a little bit of a comedy twist.",422.7

"this is perhaps, the best multiplayer first person shooter game that ive ever played. it is simply the best in gameplay, mechanics and overall fun. theres a total of nine distinct classes that can be played on a multitude of game modes and maps. every class is different in its own way, which makes it extremely entertaining to master each. with every class comes a different way to approach certain maps and dangers while playing the game. want to take a stealthy approach? then play spy. want to be quick and flank your opponent? then play scout. there is no end to the possibilities of how to play each class on different maps and in different game modes. get this game. you will not regret it.",226.8

"great game for cod fans... no its alot better than that crap... valve, you have outdone yourself yet again. while it may not have the best graphics in the world, it is still a great shooter game. in my opinion the best class is either sniper or spy. sniper because you can snipe people from many different distances... and get a great shield from spies. speaking of spies, they are great because you can turn invisible and walk up behind someone, then morph into someone on their team and backstab them. everyone can try it, after all, its free! all out great game and i definately reccommend it.",129.9

"for the more educated people only! this game goes deep into the heart of economics where one could learn to trade various cosmetic items for metal. each hat metapohrically represents a slice of life. the more hats you have, the more you are seen as a person in-game. the gibus, however, is like a dying stock share where one could never gain any sort of profit from it. a painted gibus is the ultimate display of poverty since it displays the well-proven fact that you no longer have a hat to paint! therefore it is recommended that one takes every single stats course in school in order to understand such a deep, and well-made hat simulator. i have lost my life investing into many hats in order to maximize my virtual metal income. i highly recommend this game for those who are interested in how microeconomics work. also comes with a fps mini-game.",1443.9

"this is the best jrpg ive ever played. the customizability of your teammates is just ridiculous, and with over 400 personas to summon, the game just oozes with content. my only problem is there are only 8 social links to do, and there arent enough male characters; dont get me wrong, i love a jrpg with powerful female companions, but theres only one male in this game and its the main character. there are also over 50 dungeons in the game, and while the game can be hard, the challenge is certainly one of the most enjoyable aspects of tf2. i give tf2 a 10/10, because it is the best jrpg ever since call of duty on the ps1.",2721.0

"the game was very fun for all my buddys at school a year ago but after a while gets a little dull, so we joined servers with different game modes like arena. but alot of people in tf2 im guessing about 60% just play for items to sell its very annoying while playing a game. all people do is try to offer there items out to other people and then sell what they got in return. soon youll join with the trading side i give 1-3 months till your obsessed with hats and trying to get alot to sell and trade. so overall basically gameplay is good when people play. so i recommend this game just stay away from trading and youll have ablast!just trade weapons if ya wanna stay away from hats n crates and dont buy keys btw dont buy a item from store,unless you want more space just buy a 50 cent weapon and then never buy weapons again trade people for them. only weapons",1047.6

"to give a negative review of this game would be insane. this game has taken the multiplayer co-op genre by storm, one of the best team-based fps as far as i am concerned. the nine classes each have their pros and cons and valve has did an amazing way of balancing the games weapons, i have yet to even encounter a single hacker or cheater in my 470+ hours in this game. its unique style of graphics and amusingly funny personalities of the nine classes even add more immersion to this game, there is no reason for you not to have this game yet, it is free and perhaps the main reason why people get steam is just to play this amazing game.",884.9

"it was a great game... two years ago. it still worth your time if you have acces to a private server. the amount of different weapons added to the game and the f2p thing just took away the fun. despite all of that, i must admit that i still play sometimes.",606.6
"if you like stabbing people in the back, collecting heads, collecting hats, conga lines, blowing people up, this outlandish fps game is for you!! collect, craft, and trade items to get the best loadout for each of the nine classes. rocket or sticky jump your way out of danger, place unstoppable sentrys, freeze people solid, much much more! i rate this game... ten out of 5 stars!!",188.6

"10/10: beyond recommended! the only game ive seen so far where the characters have more depth to them, without having a single player campaign to tell each individual story. what was once a simple class-based multiplayer fps, has turned into a game that has new weapons, wearable hats, and has amassed the ability to market said items and create an economy for itself using the law of supply and demand.the game expands more and more each update. did i mention, its free? its obvious that i dont need to, but i couldnt understand what would stop someone from not playing this.",1785.3

(*fine*) you are one of nine mercenaries, the scout, the pyro, the soldier, the engineer, the heavy, the medic, the spy, the sniper or the demoman, and your job is to load enemies with lead. several gamemodes, with new ones being added every once in a while, all of them fun. do you like popping lead into everything? then youre a heavy. do you like run n gun gameplay? then youre a scout. do you like destroying your enemies $#!* with grenade launchers and sticky bombs? then you get to be a demoman. each character has a visual personality, and theres a character for eveyone. i dont play this game as much as i wish i did, but still, i highly reccomend it. :)",30.8
"a game i can have non-stop fun with multi-class action on amazing maps with a huge variety of weapons to kick  with and insane amounts of cosmetics to show off! as of the love & war update this game got 200% more fun, new taunts like conga, skullcracker, flippin awesome give a new depth into the game as co-operation from both sides of the fight is pretty common now! for new players, this game may seem like a bore, because of the masses upon masses of weapons (which you may not have yet) or the large amount of maps and gamemodes that may seem new to you (payload, payload race, control points etc.), but trust me, with 1300+ hours i can say each second was well-spent either destroying the opposing team or dancing with them! either way this game is a blast and i definately recommend it to anyone! 95/100 pyros are still fairly over-powered, a list of things to nerf: speed decrease (10%) flamethrower dps (10%) backburner + phlog mini-crit instead of crit sexcellent game.",1851.3

"i am truly sorry but you cannot own a pc without at least giving this game a try. team fortress 2 is arguably the most balanced and enjoyable f2p fps on the market (if not out of all fpss). the f2p model of this game is a work of genius with random item drops roughly every hour; you will be constantly playing just for that next drop. with 9 very distinct classes from the backstabbing spy, to the adorably dangerous pyro you dont even have to know how to aim! with a constant stream of updates and the upcoming annual smissmas update there has never been a better time to fall in love with this game. i promise you wont regret it, and besides its free!",204.8
"this game is terrible. terribly fun! but why does it say its $19.99? when i got it, it didnt say anything like that.",15.3

"great game over all. i only have 1 complaint. no new weapons in such a long time! people new to this game, beware of scammers!",782.8
"i would totally recommend tf2 to my friends. tf2 does a great job at introducing new items and involving the community to build a fun and exciting future for the game. the steam integration rocks and the community behind it is even better. i started my team fortress playing back in 1996 with quake team fortress and put 100s of hours of gameplay into the original and i think valve has done an excellent job in developing a sustainable game with tf2. there are a ton of different ways to enjoy tf2, but there is something to offer for everyone. if you enjoy crafting, trading, or just a game of shoot em up, you can find a map or server that will be tailored for you. to keep me hooked for such a long time, the game definitely wins a thumbs up! from me. best of all, it is free to play, but dont forget to support the game developers if you can to keep the community going. enjoy!",1915.4

"this wacky fps shooter is a great sucessor to the original team fortress and i would highly recomend this game as it is free, although the download is rather large it is worth it, the only problem is that in order to get a smooth expxerience from this game you need quite a beefy computer on top of relitavely good internet connection. get this game!!",235.8

"used to be my favorite game but not anymore. its a good game if you like first person shooters and has many interesting differences but the main problem i have with this game is the crashing. it crashes a lot. i have searched the internet many times for a fix but there just is none. there is more than one crash and they happen often. the game is good, sure its a little dead from very few updates but still fun every now and then, if it doesnt crash when i enter the game. i used to think this game was amazing but not since valve has turned a cold shoulder and left the game for dead (reference intended). the game has not had a major bug that affects many users fixed and it has been around for many years. worth a download but be warned, it will crash most likely. 7/10",317.9

"why did you come here looking at these reviews? if i were you, id slap myself across the face (but im not you so dont do it). this game ive enjoyed more and played more than some of the most costly games ive bought on the steam market. the game is sort of a pay-to-not-be-thought-of-as-a-loser gamer, but you could buy the measliest item in the tf2 store (less than .30$) and be considered a pay 2 play, so it isnt a problem. if you like being able to control different characters, have cool weapons, and own hats... this game is for you. without a doubt. get this game. kthxbai",689.1

"it was a great game... two years ago. it still worth your time if you have acces to a private server. the amount of different weapons added to the game and the f2p thing just took away the fun. despite all of that, i must admit that i still play sometimes.",606.6

"pros: -decent overall balanced fps -free to play but not a pay 2 win all non-cosmetic items can be aquired without ingame purchases at all -well optimized -fully rebindable controls and fov -community made content -large array of different gamemodes and maps cons: -constant stream of children coming in from games like cod and complaining about how the game isnt cod (quit crying) -some weapons/tactics are op/rage inducing/just plain dumb -people come into the game with no idea what to do (at least watch some gameplay) -large quantities of community made servers run pay 2 win donation systems (these dont come from the game just the server hosts themselves) overall: tf2 is a fun game overall its just it lacks the full support from valve who instead of listening to the community about bugs/broken weapons/exploits will just keep adding in more items to keep making money from it. i will post as positive but remain in a sort of 50/50 state about the game.",633.6

"i really did enjoy this game, until they removed the scout, soldier, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper and spy as they were too confusing for new players. people always used to joke about how there were hats in this game, and so many different weapons. now that is all gone and the only cosmetic customisation available is a gibus and pyrovision goggles. as for weapons there is of course still the default flamethrower as well as the backburner, with +forward and +attack permanently active. team fortress 2 had a good run, but i have to agree, more than 1 class was a bit confusing. as for maps, i could rarely find my way out of spawn, thank goodness there is only pl_upward now! kappa",1180.7

"team fortress 2 is exectly what the name is. its a game where you have to oppose against another team and the best team eventualy wins. this is nothing like call of duty as every class in here as an advantage and a disadvantage. for example the scout runs really really fast but has low hp and because you only have shotguns and pistols you need to get close to you emeney in order to take him out quickly. i really advice you to download this game since its free and it has a lot of options. try teaming up with some friends and do some mann vs machine or try to launch a rocked into space. it is all possible with the right amount of teamwork and fun :d",1397.8

"team fortress was introduced to my by my lovely boyfriend and my brother. since being introduced to it, ive loved the game so much. honestly, its really funny and i love meeting and playing with new people. the weapons are really cool, and i like how each class can fit a persons play style. for example, i like scout because i like to do things really quickly. and scout lets me do that! all in all, a fun game that i play a lot! ( every day, all day. ) would definatey reccomend to my friends!",118.2
"team fortress 2 has the most balanced classes around with some being more for new players and others being for the more experienced. take the sniper. the sniper is the easiest class in the game and it is extremely easy to use. it is recommended to try and shoot the body and not the head, as it does almost the same amount of damage. the pyro however, is almost impossible to master and the people who are able to use it well have been called w+m1-ers. this stands for win+medic1, because a pyro and a medic are almost unstoppable and can win the game if the pyro has any decent amount of skill. the heavy is also one of the harder class, and the win+medic1 also applies to it. there are many great game modes and maps, but i love deathmatch on 2fort myself.",164.1

"graphics - the graphics for team fortress 2 might not seem up to par with other valve games, but its the art style that matters. the cartoonish graphics fit so well with this game, i wouldnt have it any other way! 5/5 music - this game has amazing music! its a shame we typically only hear it on the menu and during events. 3/5 story - while team fortress 2 does have a story, its never told in game. the story can be found on the wikipedia page, if youre interested in reading it. it explains why the two teams are fighting, at least. 2/5 replayability - many gamemodes, maps, and weapons always being added. dont like what they have? modded game mods range from far and wide, prophunt, saxton hale, the list goes on. its never a bad time when you launch this game again. 5/5 gameplay - the gameplay is nice, and balanced. something other fpss cant always say. not pay to win, either, which should be noted considering its also free-to-play! 5/5 overall score - 4/5 good.",1233.4

"getting close to my 500th hour on this beauty. its an amazing game with lots of new things to explore and do, just tons of fun. only one problem though: it gets boring after 200 hours of f2p so if you kinda wanna have more fun and keep going, you have to buy keys and other items from the store :d 8/10 from me.",667.8
"this game is probably one of my favorite first person shooters ever. there is so much variety in the different weapons and hats and miscellaneious items. if you get bored of fighting your friends in attack and defend or payload, switch over to mvm and work together to smash robots heads in! team fortress 2 will probably overwhelm players in the beginning who are used to say, call of duty or battlefield. this game is nothing like those games. i suppose the closest you can get is the sniper, with his smg, and sniper rifle. but i digress, youll have to play a tf2 to get what i mean. anyway, this if one of, if not the best free to play game ever made. i sure plenty of people will agree with me when i say that. also, dont get your hopes up on hats, they are so expensive now. along with keys. but hey, so long as you have your gibus, merc badge, and pyrovison googles, you should be fine. now get out and kill some guys, welcome to team fortress 2!",531.9
"team fortress 2 is really fun and has a verity of characters . when you get tired of playing as soldier you play as sniper when your tierd of playing sniper you play as pyro when your done with pyro you go back to soldier. its amazingly fun. its so different from all the other fps games i harldy even like fps games but this game is awesome!",48.6

"i dont always play fpss.but when i do i play team fortress 2.",322.8
"fantastic online fun, although much better with friends who arent on the opposite team. lots of different game styles, whether official or community made, all nine classes are fairly well balanced if your team is too. 8/10 would recommend even if you dont play many shooter games",1013.5
"action packed, crazy cartoon fun! i would reccomend this game to anyone looking for comedy, guns and gore! the community is great. the weapons are great. the hats are halarious! 7/10",270.2
"i absolutely love it earned three weapons on my first day",19.5
"hello! welcome to tf2! this is one of the most funny games but belvie me if youre a competitive player you shouldnt try it.i played this game like 500h and i will show you my opinion about this game.i will do pro and cons. pro : -envolve teamwork -f2p game -funny and challenging -updates every month ( ex. : mvm, hats n miscs , wepons,taunts) -easy classes (ex : pryo) -tf2 trading cons: - not blanched (ex. scout deals a lot of damage if he is close to the traget,but he very vulnarable.one pipe mean more then 100 hp and he has 125 hp. - makes you angry sometimes. -as i said before you need a good team. (ex : if you play as spy your team should distract the enamy attention to backstab them more easly ) -broken wepons ( ex : plog,soda poper,direct hit,force of nature etc...) i realy hope you like my review and i recommend this game for every steam user who likes trying new experiences",769.5
"best f2p fps i know. anyone can play it, because it doesnt require a good graphics card. it also has a friendly interface, and loads of players.",637.2

"the game is extremely fun, but the trading system is very confusing and hard to understand, other than that its perfect",528.7
"would recommend for people who like ctf,koth and other game modes.one of the reasons why is because of hats and misc iteams.there 9 classes that you can be.an other reason why is because fo weapons and you can play with your friends and go to competetive servers and achivement/friendly servers.really good game.",1201.2
"kill a squeaker. get cussed out for doing so. 10/10 would dominate again",1007.0

"its a great game to play with friends, and drops always come in handy! makes you want to continue playing it just for those. just kidding, this game is frustating as , and the many times i reached a server ready to kill just to see everyone dancing conga and kicking the players that kill, makes me mad.",70.1
"this game is the best thing since sliced bread. in fact its better than sliced bread, because it has sliced bread (see sandvich). the only problem is that sliced bread doesnt have a 7 gb file size. which is annoying, especially if you have a 10gb broadband allowance. bt will chase you with a shotgun, but the months in hospital are worth it. until you realise your hub is crap. still 10/10 though. because engies arent affected by lag (or the laws of physics) yeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw!",228.5

"amazing game that is really the backbone of steam. an insane amount of time has been poured into this game by the developers, the community, the players, the traders. the first few hours you play, youll probably be massacred and have something like a 1:10 kill-death ratio, but after a while, youll play late into the night, hacking away at peoples heads and lighting them aflame. if you have not downloaded this yet, i strongly reccomend you do so.",893.8
"its fun and free to play. the community is dying through out the years, the game isnt as fun as it use to be. oh the glory days... but its still a great game and its really fun to play here and there if youre bored.",226.0

"i highly recommend getting team fortress 2, wheter you are getting because its free and looking for something new or plan on being a dedicated fan. this is a fast paced action shooter with 9 unique classes to choose from each supporting thier team in diffirent ways.one of the besy shooters out there. and hey, its free!(unless you become dedicated and decide to spend your hard-earned cash on items, but the base price is nothing.",809.3

"while i only have about 150 hours on record (some would scoff at how pitiful that is) i consider myself to be good at this game, really good compared to some who do not know how to shoot one of the numerous and interesting weapons that subtly change the game mechanics in favour of a personalised play style. then theres the hats. items used for, if nothing else, to show your social standing (a.k.a how much money you are willing to spend on a cosmetic). while it does sound i am bemoaning the game, i am not, really and honestly, i love this game. so much so that i would be eccstatic if a new tf3 came out rather than half-life. i even have a good idea on how to transfer the story the comics into the gameplay and how to make it succesful. if only a big name developer would be interested *wink**wink* ;) 20/10",586.3

"hello, my name is spark and i play tf2. tf2 has been a game that meant more than a f2p game. this game is great. from the non-stop abusing of overpowered weapons and classes and the large amount of people who have spent more than 500$ on the game but still have no clue how to play it this game still keeps me interested. download this game if you are a troll or just want to enjoy a quality game every once in a while. gr8 r8 m8 8/8",524.4
"if you cant afford games like call of duty: advanced warfare, or counter strike: global offesive, then this game is for you! why you ask? well its a great game overall, because its a cartoony shooter what more can ask? its not like those games with fancy graphics like tomb raider, cod: advanced warfare, bioshock2, portal2, etc. so i suggest you add this game to your library and give it a try :)",946.4
"as of now, i only have around 200 hours on record, so dont take this too seriously. this game is just amazing. some come here for the action scene, while others come here for the trading scene. valve did a really great job with this and i would love to see a tf3... maybe.      also hats",345.0

"ive been playing tf2 for quite some time now and ive loved nearly every second of it. for the most part, the community is polite. its a fantastic game that valve has nurtured and continually balances out. when you hear tf2, you may think of the word hat and that is a very normal reaction. when i saw a copy of the orange box and that beautiful fat russian with gordon... i was overjoyed and bought it. it was certainly not a mistake on my part to do so. the 9 classes to choose from have their own unique and enjoyable features. theres also a lot of hats. all in all, this is the best hat simulator that valve has to offer.",749.0

"basically a good first-time-game, if you want to play shooting games. graphics are unique when you compare it to other team vs team games. a big shop with a lot of clothing and free weapons makes the game more interesting, in a way that the users can get creative and style their own characters. nine classes, makes the game more challenging and less boring, as you can just switch class when you feel like it. the videos about the characters and their histories are absolutely terrific, and the medic is something you dont see in every game, as you heal with a medic-gun and shoots with this incredible syringe shooting gun, where in other games its often a character with a medic-back and often with normal (often normal) guns or in use of some type of magic. also is the game always active with players and new products in store. in all is the game catchy and available for everyone. 5/5",278.5
"ive wasted many glorious hours playing this, and i can say ive had one heck of a time. in team fortress 2, youre essentially playing 9 different games at once with the radical gameplay differences each class has, and on top of that the many gamemodes provides even more diverseity to how you play each class, since their role changes depending on the gamemode. it is an unorthodox and first person shooter that continues to break the mold of what a game in the genre can be, and i would recommend it to anyone that, essentially, wants something that is completely different, while still maintaining enough familiarity for those accustomed to the fps genre. effective teamwork, diversity, balanced and fast-paced gameplay; what more could you ask for in a fun-to-play and free-to-play first person shooter like tf2. oh yeah...hats...dont forget about hats...",649.6

"of all the 300 odd games i have, ive played this one more than all the others combined (as of 7/2013), which says a lot about this games quality and replayability. in my opinion its one of the best tycoon games ever, as you work your way up the ladder of hats and unusuals, but instead of earning money proportional to the quality and quantity of your hats, you have to play a cute fps minigame to earn basic items, that you can use to trade your way up to more hats. this is an interesting take on the tycoon formula, but puts more focus on economy and trading, and obviously works well for this game. 10/10, would wear hats again.",484.9

"team fortress 2 (also known as tf2) is a brilliant game really worth the time and the best thing its fun and free! this game has been around for 7 years now and is still going strong so it must be good if its been in 7 years of development! it is on windows, mac and linux and has also been ported to consoles but is a very old update on the consoles so your best off with it on pc. team fortress 2 is a very well optimized game and could easily run on a laptop or desktop computer roughly made after 2009 or 2010 so not very recent. many games are a pay to play unlike team fortress 2 as they need dlc to get through certain doors or get weapons but team fortress 2 makes this optional and you get weapons for playing so play time means weapon time. i would definetly get this game as soon as possible and i would give it a 10/10 and it never gets old so get downloading and have fun!",232.2

"at the time of this review, i have played about 530 hours of this game. i have enjoyed every second, whether i would prefer to admit it or not. the feeling you get by firing any weapon and getting a kill is enough to go back again and again. unlike counter-strike, the weapons are very cartoonish and the game is just a joke that makes you want to laugh in a mans face when they are pinned against a wall due to an arrow. the animations are, to say the least, hilarious the first time i saw them. i recommend this game for if you have a few hours to kill, or a few people. i also like to land on some peoples head after a rocket jump and make a poop noise. but thats just me. if you like realistic shooters, this game is not for you. if you are used to clicking on people, this game is not for you. if you are an fps player who yearns for something different, this game is defienitly for you. cheers. oh, and there are also a few bugs and hackers too. 9.9/10",668.4

(watch out for scout though, hes a real bugger...)",77.8
"well, for the few people left who dont play tf2, this game is awesome. the class system is great, the classes themselves are great in both personality and have a playstyle for everyone, and the weapons are mostly awesome. the sniper is for people who can aim well, the pyro brings versatility to the battlefield, the heavy soaks up damage like towel in rain, and the engineer is the class that just makes other players go crazy by killing them with a sentry gun. the best part is: 100% absolutely free. no hoops to jump through, no fees to pay, money saved. money is spent optionally. who knows if you want to, but tf2 is fun without it.",98.3

"ive spent over 2,000 hours (give or take with idle) and i must say it is single handedly the best game for a free to play to pick up. it has 9 diverse classes and an easy to pickup combat system, aswell as that tons of different game modes for players to use. as well as being so diverse, the game has endless fun and humour aswell as a insanely high skill level that i would say would be almost impossible to master. whether its a scouts hit-scanning ability or a soldiers ability to airshot fluently or just an engineers sentry placement the hours you invent so master these skills leaves anyone on their toes and wanting to play more. i definetely rate this game a 10/10 and recommend it to anyone.",2188.8

"this is a really good take on your typical multiplayer fps. people that play cod usually dont like this because there is no way to replicate the weapons in the game since tf2 actually requires some thinking and strategy (if youre playing one of the more strategic classes). the balance in the game is perfect since all of the classes have their strengths and weaknesses. i would reccomend that people buy this game as you can jump in from pretty much any point as the stock (default) weapons are just as powerful as any so its incredibly easy to just download it and join in with your friends (unless you wear the ghastly gibus, then prepare to be called a noob).",627.7

"this game is horrible! ive never played a more poorly-made game in my life!!!! it has no story at all, not even the mvm! the worst part of it is, is that the teams have the same people on them! each person, whether theyre on the opposite team, or on yours, look completely the same! its also also as unrealistic as call of duty!!! in fact, its less realistic!!! how can a solider survive a rocket jump, or multiple ones!?!?!??! valve, if youre smart, youll take this game down, or make it at least a little realistic as arma. if you cant do that, then take this horrific game down please!!!!!!!!!!

"should write a real review for this game. when tf2 started, it was a game with no weapon customization. nowadays, the game is defined by weapons instead of classes itself. skill is completely seperate from the realms of class capability and weapon capability. but that doesnt mean that performance is. if you are going to play on any server with all weapons allowed, there is a lot going against you no matter what. generally, no matter what strategy you adhere yourself to, there is a weapon designed to deal with that. if there was a world without latency, perhaps this would not be an issue. when a player plays on a big server, and things like alltalk and good communication are not used as they are in competitive play, the player has a greater chance of becoming the victim of a weapon specifically designed to feed off an unusual situation. in summary, tf2 is basically a two-team struggle against poor game mechanics.",1057.8

"one of the most addicting game in history. personally, its my favorite game. so what is team fortress 2? team fortress 2 is a multiplayer action-fps game, you play as 9 different classes with different abilities and roles. the fast and speeding scout, the aggressive and rocketjumping soldier, the mysterious and masked pyro, the drunk and explosive demoman, the big russian heavy, the sentrymaking engineer, the lifesaver medic, the headshotting sniper and the backstabbing spy. what makes it addicting and awesome? the gameplay itself needs actual teamwork to complete the objectives and defeat the opposing team. you need to cooperate with your teammates to complete the objectives. besides from that, there are trading features that allows you to trade items like cosmetics, weapons and bunch of other stuff with other players. the community itself is growing and expanding. 10/10 would play again.",1098.2

"yes, this game is deffinately awesome. since it used to be pay 2 play before it went f2p, it still keeps a lot of the p2p structure. you only need to spend money on items. and, a rarity among mmofps games, there is no virtual currency. its all items and crafting ingredients. now, onto the game. this game is seriously fun. the different classes are all...well....different, and trust me, you will not get bored for a while. this is a really good game. have fun!",474.1

"team fortress 2 is a deep and artistic story driven fpae ( first person artistic experience ) that is a must play for all. what starts as a typical military story about a young boy named nogames forced into a war against his will evolves into a dramatic well paced plot involving a hat conspiracy and overt religious themes. i was literaly left in tears at the twist ending. check this game out if you want a truly well written game that isnt afraid to delve into the controversial relationship human beings have with hats and religion. the only fault this game has is that it falls apart midway into the series when a new character named gaben is introduced and starts to take the light away from the more developed characters like robin. also the lead character nogames never truly matures although this is partially intended to represent the human condition of hats. either way this is a unique game and if youre not afraid to try something new and different then play tf2.",492.3

"i actually really enjoy playing this game, despite it being free to play. first piece of advice: sell trading cards, until you have 10 cents, and then use it in the mann co store to buy a giftapault. after you do this, you have a premium account, can get hats, more drops, and more backpack slots. if you do this, you wont even need to spend any actual money on the game, since you dont need unusuals or taunts (but that doesnt keep them from being amazing), and you can pretty much get all the weapons anways, so this game really isnt pay 2 win at all, and i really like that about this compared to almost every other free to play title.",304.8

"if you like fun to play easy to pickup and understand fpses than you have come to the right place! team fortress 2 is an amazing game that once you play its hard to put down with many dedicated servers ranging from all types of topics, locations, and even interests you will always find a server that is right for you. and if you are feeling creative just hit up the steam workshop and create a new item for the valve crew to review. you never know, you might actually be earning money. and whats better this game is not a pay to win game! this game has many weapons which you can buy, find, and unlock with achievements. all weapons have some great advantages but they also have some disatvantages to them which means no stacking stats on players. this game also fits every players play style. if your into stealthy attacks use the spy, if you like blowing stuff up the demoman would be right for you, and if you like never ending flames and burning people (if youre into that thing) use the pyro",1135.1

"i honestly recommend team fortress 2. i bought it with the orange box on the release day which would have been 10 euro, but i would pay 60 for it aswell. since the game is free to play now you need to try it out. i am disappointed in the fact that it is free to play now though, the difficulty level has drasticaly changed to low standards due to all the new players. other than that it is a nice game when youre bored",448.7
"tf2 is a free first person shooter made by valve corp. it has everything a game needs, hats, explosions, guns, plenty of maps, and a thriving, nice almost all the time community. this game is perfection, never being stale, the reason for this is because there are so many different weapons, there are almost endless possible loadouts. the 9 classes all have enjoyable personalities, and hilarious humor, and every class is well balanced and fun in some way. the classes have different moving speeds, so sometimes catching up to someone is a real pain sometimes. thats a small problem, but tf2 is a 10/10 game, and deserves the praise it gets.",1271.7

"team fortress 2 is an awesome game. each game is unique and fun.",610.7
"one of the longest running hat-simulator communities i have come across. the game itself is very fun, as the large scope of servers (from 0 crit vanilla servers to 32 player fullcrit orange x3 servers) satisfy any type of player. you can obtain almost all weapons without paying a cent, but i would definitly advise to spend a few dollars on keys in the mann co. store to go premium. with premium, drop rates heighten and you can get drop hats. overall, a very engaging game that is topped off with a crippling hat addiction.",1101.4
"its a first person shooter, and seems famous with all the players roaming around. sometimes the community is good, and i like how this allows voice chat, even though i dont use it, and sometimes kids are annoying. practically, i like it because it has 9 classes. overall the 9 classes, some have a certain job and place to be. for example, spy would hide in enemy lines while sniper would hide behind team lines. i like how the gameplay is somewhat balanced, like how heavy has alot of health, but is slow and sometimes an easy target for spies, whil being a bullet magnet, and medic can heal from a distance. but i like the different gameplay as there are slender servers out there, and theyre fun to play. overall, i like it because it has 9 classes which are somewhat balanced, an fps, and social gameplay.",1541.4
