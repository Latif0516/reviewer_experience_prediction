"one of the best free-to-play game out there and one of the best multiplayer experiences! incredibly well balanced and very fun, especially when exploring the abilities of each class. both the co-op and the versus modes are incredibly fun and unique in their one way. i highly recommend it! edit: i disagree with those saying the game is pay to win: all weapons can be found in game through playing. the only items that cannot be found with a free to play account are cosmetics such as hats and accessories",519.5

"in this game helping your team (collect hats) is vital to ensure victory in the (tryhard) battle field full of (f2ps) death and dispair (hats). with all 9 classes (9001 hats) to choose from, the gameplay (hat choice) will most definitely be different from the first time you played (wore a gibus) as your skill (backpack value) goes up in the ranks of battle (unusuals) in this free to play (free2troll) funfest (gabefest). i give it a dan outa dan.",1931.7

"i have to say. valve you are so awesome you did a wonderful job!!! this game has to be one of the best games ive ever played. its just one of those games you dont play once and then give up forever. its one of those games where you play it the first time and it just gets so addicting. i have to say this is one of valves greatest creations. from all the different classes, to the 9ish different game modes this game is a work of art that everyone deserves to see. i also am a fan of the gamemode, mann vs machine. its something unique that i have seen in some other games, but all the other stuff added makes of for it. i guess the only downside of the game, is that the game is rated m and im not really a fan of blood. i did find a youtube video that lets you put in the code to turn off the blood however. i give this game a 99/100 for a new unique game that everyone deserves to play.",135.5

"pretty much the best free to play game ive played so far. the multiplayer on this game is awesome. its all team based and fun, no class is more important then any other class. its not all self based like call of duty, you work with your team to win. team fortress 2 also has unique weapons that help you in combat. on the other hand, i had to talk about hats. some people play just for the hats, i play for usually both of them. if youre looking for a great f2p game, this is the game for you. hope you have fun!",1635.2
"this game is free and yet it is one of the most popular games on steam. that says something. i definitely recommend playing tf2 or at least trying it out. however, i believe that to fully enjoy this game you cannot play for a short period of time. the reason for this belief is that when i first started playing tf2, i played for around an hour and didnt really like it. however, i decided to try playing again a month after my first try and i slowly began to enjoy it. over time i began to understand how to play as each of the characters and i unlocked many game changing items. tf2 is fairly easy to play once you get used to it, but when you first start playing, its like entering a whole new world. tf2 is unlike any other game and it will take a bit of time to fully understand it, but once you do, it becomes one amazingly fun multiplayer game.",291.5
"this shooting game where cosmetics are more important than weapons introduces the player to a world where two teams of mercenaries fight each other in various modes like king of the hill, payload race and capture the flag. there is also the mann vs machine mode where a small team fights giant hordes of robots. play as the 9 different mercenaries, each with their own abilities and personality quirks. no matter your skill or playing style, theres a class that suits it! youll surely enjoy this game that never gets old thanks to the frequent updates that bring new content such as hats, maps, weapons and gamemodes. and the best part is that its not pay to win, since the game is well balanced and you can get weapons for free fairly easily. your only concern will be getting more cosmetics! team fortress 2 is pure multiplayer fun, and one of the best games ive ever played.",1993.7
"definitely a game you should of have played, since its free to play.",649.2

"team fortress 2, seems like such an understatement when i say i recommend this. its probably my favorite game of all time with over 2000 hours logged on it. even though people may not like the hats and new items, personally i think thats what keeps this game alive. every time the game feels like its getting boring or repetitive, they add something new that makes the game feel fresh and fun. this is the only game i think id ever give a perfect 10/10, because the games always expanding. the community on the other hand, is quite a lot like the sonic fanbase, and ill just leave it at that. in conclusion, if you havent played this game before, do it; i cannot stress that enough, download it and play it. its free, but i highly recommend buying something in it at some point in time.",2481.4

"ok lets start with the pros so team fortress 2 is all about team work even when you dont know that your working you are because you are doing the objective secoundly you can customize you charcter with cosmetics such as hats and clothing there are many hats and some can get pretty expensive unless you earn them in game they can go as high as 145 $ yay thats expensive and lastly for the pros each chacter has its ups in down i dont wanna get to deep in but they each are unique now lets head over to the cons now there can sometimes be bugs and glitchs but besides the point it kind of like a freemium game with u having to buy things if you want more but thats an option there are many game modes in tf2 incudeing the new mvm i think this is just a great game so if you have a chance check it out and im giving this game a 9 out of 10 check it out and thanks for reading this review",150.4
"fun addictive, great gameplay and just downright cool game. though i must say i wish it was easier to find weapons and other cosmetic items but once you become a premium member im sure thats no longer an issue. i personally hope that they add a new character to the game something like the engineer where he can place down support, but without the permanant effect but the trade off is his is stronger in some way.",134.9

"+the game is a fun fps with multiple classes to vary up your play style and changes the way it is from other fpss, then it just being a point and shoot with the regular fps guns: smg, sniper, assualt rifle, etc. but tf2 adds a more expansive take with weapons: flamethrower, minigun, sentries, etc. id say this game is worth it since its been pretty active for 8 years. (to this date) -although the game has multiple hats, misc. etc. for you to wear on your characters, and different types of weapons (genuine, vintage, strange, etc.) with along the trading the comes along with this game and can get you into a fuss over wanting an item for a long time and then going into the habbit of buying everything from either the mann co. store or the steam market. this game will consume your money more then pickpocketers in europe. although the game is a new a fun fps with still 8 years of active people and with the downfall of trading i still give this game a.. 9/10",1367.9

"first day you play tf2-this is such a great game, all those classes , too complex, i will never understand them and handle them. after a few days: now i know everything about every class. such a cool game! the day you get the gibus!: hmm is this a hat? let`s try it on! after you realise that tf2 is a conga and a hat simulator you want more hats. because, well , why not? after 1 month: you love this game so much, you have a single hat and you want more but you realise that you don`t have inventory. you buy a great hat from mann co store and then surpise! you get other hat gifted my mann co store because you bought something!! a few moments after you realise that you got those hats: hmm...i have one hat(gibus) and these 2 hats. illuminati triangle has 3 sides. 1+2=3 --illuminati confirmed!! anyway gr8 game m8. 7.357/10-ign-best hat simulator ever made. as an additional information you realise that your money disappeared. would play that again",404.2

"as you can tell by my play time i quite enjoy this game. i find it extremely fun. this game is filled with the craziest things. you can grab your minigun, or your sheild and sword. it has nine classes to chose from, all with distinct roles and weapon sets. what is really cool is that it is fun even to the free players. you can get most weapons without having to pay. if you decide to buy anything from the in-game store you are automatically upgraded to a premium account. all you gain from this is more frequent item drops, the ability to trade and other minor things. all in all i think the game is extremely entertaining.",569.0

"i totally recommend this game to anyone interested. tf2 is a first person shooter... kinda. this game can involve wacky shenanagins, like bumper cars, giant strongman games, silly cosmetics, and watching really bad players. what i really like is that you can get almost a full experiance with the free to play option, with only some crafting, trading, and inventory space being limited. the only downsides to this game are the cost of some items, like keys and paints, and the glitches. oh the glitches. although sometimes funny, they can be a real hassle. there are times when you cant join games, have trading errors, are unable to turn or quite, and can only swing your current weapon, glitches caused by using the chat, and anything along those lines. overall though, this game can be a lot of fun for people of many ages.",841.8
"probably in the top 10 for my favorite games of all time easily. so many modes, some fun mods... well structured classes with their own deep backstories. humorous. not to mention that the balance and diversity of weapons is great. no overpowered weapons. trading in this game adds a whole new dimension for some people. i dont trade for profit anymore. why not give it a shot? its free. if you take a liking to it i would highly reccommend going premium. i didnt go premium until i hit 200 hours though. it was definetly worth the 49 cent investment. definetly. i later went on to play competitive tf2, which i found increasingly fun compared to the pubs in which i was dominating the rest of the server. i think valve should add a match making/ rank system in tf2. it would really help the game garner more attention as an e-sport. i think the problem is that with out these built in features, few people know about competitive at all. plz valve plz i give it a pineapple out of a guava",1115.3

"this game is in my opinion the most addictive shooter. you have 9 completly different classes to play : scout, medic, pyro, soldier, engineer, heavy, demoman, spy, sniper. every class has its own playstyles, which can also be changed by a large amount of different weapons for every slot : primary, secondary, melee. you dont die so easy in this game, so you can play really hard, long duels against players. but never think you are indestructible. something could kill you instantly. if you want to learn the game, you need to play it. you need to learn the classes pros and cons. after ca. 100 hrs of playing this game you will be able to learn the game. give it a try, youll not repend it.",685.2

"when team fortress 2 was released in 2007, it was the result of nine years of development. its now seven years later, and development hasnt actually stopped. a wealth of gamemodes, weapons, and gameplay adjustments later, team fortress 2 is less intricately well-balanced, but is still as exciting and funny as it ever was. going free-to-play was also a smart decision, i feel, as the expanded player-base means youll never go without a match. absolutely recommended.",406.8

"i have owned team fortress 2 for quite a while now, but only until it was made free to play. but i couldnt figure out how to explain it for a while now... lets try this: team fortress 2 is very different. although some first person shooters are very serious, dark, etc., tf2 takes a light-hearted approach to the genre, with cartoony graphics (but bloody), many jokes and dialouge, and the darn-this-lets-attack-the-enemy-head-on feel of the game. besides the reasons i just stated above, tf2 is very, very different from other fps games. theres no leveling, exp, upgrades of any kind. instead, you do achievements to get milestones and get guns, however those guns have advantages and setbacks compared to the original gun, to be evened out. and besides, you can either pay with real money to buy the gun, or be lucky and find it while playing (youll know what im talking about when it comes around.) there are other differences, but im running out of space. d: try it yourself!",940.8

"whenever someone thinks of pc gaming, they should think of team fortress 2. this game, along with counter-strike, has made the fps genre as it stands possible. the theme is cartoony to match the tongue-in-cheek approach the dev team is taking to death with their sarcastic, satirical humor. blog posts, shot comics, and constant updates add to an ever increasingly confusing and hilariously strange back-story with absolutely no practical application in game, except to give a base for community-made hats. did i forget to mention hats, weapons, classes, community maps, mods, and the digitalized hide-and-seek mode of prophunt?",938.0

"possibly one of the greatest first person shooters developed, due to its unique style, character diversity and likeable personality. though slightly hampered by the occasional chat spammer, multiplayer is relatively enjoyable overall. would definitely recommend this game to people new to the genre - learning curve is quite shallow and the ingame tutorials as well as the community guides do much to aid new players. those coming from a different fps, particularly more formal and fpsish games like battlefield or cod may find it a bit hard to adjust to the different playstyles, but everyone adapts eventually.",918.7
"a game i can have non-stop fun with multi-class action on amazing maps with a huge variety of weapons to kick  with and insane amounts of cosmetics to show off! as of the love & war update this game got 200% more fun, new taunts like conga, skullcracker, flippin awesome give a new depth into the game as co-operation from both sides of the fight is pretty common now! for new players, this game may seem like a bore, because of the masses upon masses of weapons (which you may not have yet) or the large amount of maps and gamemodes that may seem new to you (payload, payload race, control points etc.), but trust me, with 1300+ hours i can say each second was well-spent either destroying the opposing team or dancing with them! either way this game is a blast and i definately recommend it to anyone! 95/100 pyros are still fairly over-powered, a list of things to nerf: speed decrease (10%) flamethrower dps (10%) backburner + phlog mini-crit instead of crit sexcellent game.",1851.3

"great game for cod fans... no its alot better than that crap... valve, you have outdone yourself yet again. while it may not have the best graphics in the world, it is still a great shooter game. in my opinion the best class is either sniper or spy. sniper because you can snipe people from many different distances... and get a great shield from spies. speaking of spies, they are great because you can turn invisible and walk up behind someone, then morph into someone on their team and backstab them. everyone can try it, after all, its free! all out great game and i definately reccommend it.",129.9

"team fortress 2 is the only competitive multiplayer shooter that i have ever played consistently. ive tried others, but in the end, ive always quit after realizing that i dont have the time to compete with the guys who can play these games all day long. im sure some people love memorizing all the weapon pickup locations and mastering the jumping, spinning, no-scope headshot, but that aint me. with the games nine very specialized classes, youre very likely to find something that really just suits your play style just right. even as a newb, the class strengths are so drastic, you can almost always get in a few kills if you just do what your class does best. the experience is always lighthearted and 90% of the community is friendly. with loads of unlockable weapons, theres not only a lot of incentive to keep playing, but there ends up being quite a bit of customization within the nine classes as well. for instance, the pyros flare gun changed the entire game for me!",451.3
"a good game with memorable characters and decent gameplay, but with a few issues like server lags(during mvm this is a real pain in the butt) and most of the time unbalanced teams ( i mean that if one or two advanced players join in one team and the other, may it be beginner or decent players are just going to get screwed by them and most of the time leave the server). another thing, but that does not bug me that much, is that way too many players are at the age of ten or even lower( i think i met someone who told me he was six or seven). as i said, it`s not a big deal for me, but for many other (older) players who are just annoyed by them( for example because of mic spamming). but all in all, team fortress 2 is a fun game.",1602.1
"its a really fun game to play and its free! i have spent 200+ hours on this game and i dont regret it. its really fun to play with friends and it has some nice weapons.",245.6
"this is such a great game. its also a good thing that its free. now thats said, its put two good things together: good game + free = epicness! (then again, i guess it is an f2p) its graphics are good, its range of characters and weapons are excellent and its an all-round good game. it is very easy to get to grips with, the controls are easy and its probably a game that can be played by anyone, even those who are less confident with fps games. also, a funny aspect is the cartoon-y graphics and the certain characters faces when the post-kill video is shown. definitely one to download. just switch on your computer, start steam and click the download button. its easier than riding a bike!",47.1
"fun game for free but all the best things cost money and the keys are extortionate",96.4

"do you like team based games? do you have a fetish for hats? if the answer is yes, then what are you waiting for? download the damn game already, wear your ghostly gibus with pride, find super amazing crates, use high-tech weaponry, fly jets, ride ponies, call in airstrikes, kill terrorists, fight bears, submit to peer pressure and buy more hats, destroy your future, become a drug dealer, invite some friends and have fun.",1603.6
"overall, i definitely recommend this game to anyone. with 9 versitile classes to choose from, hundreds of weapons, and an infinite number of playstyles for each class, tf2 is a highly addicting game. working as a team or simply dominating by yourself, gameplay is amazing with every class. there is another aspect other than just fighting; there is trading! many people trade on tf2 to get different types of weapons like stranges, festives, vintages, etc. and getting hats. some unusual hats can be worth hundreds of dollars! the best part of all, is that the game is free. and although you may have to buy that 99 cent giftapult to go premium, i believe i would have payed 60 dollars for this game, maybe more. thats just how awesome this game is :d",635.4

"this game its just the best i ever played (my opinion). with the trading system, the community market gets realy exiting when u get to grow up ur fortune. the gameplay itself can not be described untill u play the game, try it if u dont play already, go ahead and play 3 hrs. ull get addicted.",1817.4
"played it on my old account and now i will start again cuz its freaking awesome game",58.5

"i actually shouldnt write this recommendation because tf2 is already so viral in the internet that its common knowledge that this game is stupidly awesome! with a comical 50s setting and time, tf2 picks stereotypes of those times and show them off in nine different classes full of fun. its a free-to-play game that includes co-op horde mode and competitive. you have my recommendation to dive into this great game!",458.1
"this game is diffrent from any other dull fps. the classes feel alive and all have there streghts and weaknesses. you cant quickscope which is great. you have to charge up your shots as sniper. you cant insta kill with a knife, you have to backstab as a spy. overall this game takes alot of practice and strategy. great game!!!",52.9

"tf2 is an awesome first person shooter game. all the classes are well balanced with there strengths and weaknesses, but there should be more ammo in the guns and the melee weapons should strike at further range. tf2 is still really cool with all the kits and the effects are awesome.",13.6

"even though its been out for a long time, it is still a very fun game. there are 9 different classes, (one example is scout which can run really fast and double jump) they each have their own styles. i really love this game because unlike other games where you can change your gun giving maybe a -1% accuracy or somethibg, changing items in this game can make a huge deal. there are also lots of new updates that come out and cool hats, suits, etc. all these things make the game really fun to play. i would recommend this game. 1010 in my book.",1373.4

"meh, at least it didnt crash. (just kidding it crashed like 30 times)",194.3
"out of all the dress-up sims i have ever played this is by far the worst. theres only two uniforms you can wear, blu or red. the only redeeming quality of this dress-up sim is the plethora of hats one can equip to their avatar. unfortunately in order to do this, one has to stand around doing nothing for hours on end with the chance of even finding one of these hats. one thing the creators of this game may want to consider is the ability to at least swap clothing between the different characters one can choose for their avatar. that really really big man would look much better in the suit on the scrawny guy, who in turn would look much better with a nice bowler or something instead of a sock on his head. all in all i give this game a 4/10.",948.0
"i recommend this game is because it is just awsome!!! and why it is so awsome is because it aint just some shooting game oh no it aint just no shooting game you can find cool weps for all of your 9 characters. and i cant forget the hats and miscs thats right you can costumize your own character you can get him hats and miscs and maybe if your lucky youll get a unusual those are the best types of hats you can get. well thats all i got to say today but hey one more thing trust me if you get this game you wont regret it. sencirley yours sniperxprox456.",520.5

"its not called a war based hat simulator for nothing!",877.3
"ah, where do i start about this game! first of all of them, the basic mechanics: you can choose from 9 different classes anytime while you are ingame. you and your team have to complete an objective. but, after you starting to get into it a lot you start to notice the other stuff: all the weapons you can get, all the cosmetics you can wear and the super amazing community that suports this outstanding game! you can either play the game, or start doing some trading stuff. either way, this game is recommended for anyone: if you like teamplay, shooting people or robots or just doing some absolute nonsense get this game!!! final rating: 10/10 stole my life away and i still come back here everyday.",1175.9
"very fun game, fun to play when bored or when you want to play with friends. mvm: this is a fun gamemode, you have to defeat robots in order to win the wave, collect money to upgrade your player. there is a variety of maps, you will never get bored! pvp: two teams battle it out on a mission to win the match, there are many game modes, from ctf to payload race. pvp is personally my favorite, you can verse your friends or even other people, you can rank up in competitive mode and you can also unlock cool cosmetics! this game is by far my favorite game so far with many updates to come! 10/10",478.0

"team fortress 2. tf2. call it what you want, but itll always be my favorite game. tf2 is a team-base shooter game about a butt-load of different game modes. payload is a popular one, i like this one best because its more of a team-based effort, instead of an mvp. attack/defense is my next favorite, same thing, encourages teamwork. ill leave you to decide the remaining game modes. i recommend this game if youre into first person (or third-person for that matter) cartoon-ish shooting games. p.s. best map imo: trade_abstract2 p.p.s. higher nation ftw p.p.p.s. im not on crack you dingus -.-",1118.2

"so cool !! i recomend new players to download this game",183.3
"i could, and sometimes do, play this game all day without stopping. it never gets old. the graphics are awesome, the characters are hilarious, and theres a lot of diversity in each of them. one of the few games where you rely on the strengths of everyone to win, but can still have a lot of fun even when you lose. it doesnt take a lot of learning to figure out how to get going, and the gameplay is solid. they continually add in new weapons and features, as well as new maps, and with it as cheap as it is, its definitely worth picking up.",211.2
"tf2 is one of the best fps ever made for me if your thinking about playing get it its free",1251.2
"probably the best free-to-play on steam. its got a little something for everyone. want to run around burning stuff? done. want to blast away your enemies? done. maybe sit back and snipe? got it. stealthily dodging enemies and tricking them? can do it. build sentries and teleporters? easy. or maybe heal your teammates and keep them in the fray? my favorite. and if you absolutely must kill everything in front of you, weve got a man and a minigun. i say again, the best f2p on steam!",325.8

"this is easily one of my personal favorite games i have ever played. i watched a couple of tf2-related videos on youtube and thought: huh. everyone likes this. i could give it a try, but... what if its like call of duty where its literally the same thing that has already been done thousand times? then, i saw top nine team fortress by fawfuls minion. i was impressed. there was variation, things that werent possible in the real world, no annoying blood effects on your screen when you were hurt. i downloaded steam and the game. despite it eating up a boatload of memory and lots of my time, i didnt regret my choice and will probably never start to regret it.",742.6
"this game is my favorite. its really free-to-play! you dont have to pay any money to get weapons, unless you want to. and if you buy any one thing, youre automatically upgraded. and if you really want a hat, you can easily get one from an achievement. its also a great place to meet friends or dominate noobs, whichever you prefer. so if you dont have this great game, get it. its free and fun. :)",193.9
"i wouldnt really fully recommend this to any old school gamer, but for free its one of the best games ever. valve have done an amazing job making their games available free to play for all, with premium access to the orange box buyers, so now valve can bring in lots more players that werent previously aware of their awesome games. only problem i find with it is most of the community, and the unseriousness of the gameplay. the hats, the items, they just dont do it for me. tfc was all about teamwork, shooting, and plain seriousness. whereas with tf2, its all just joking, cartoon-y, hats, items, trading...you get the point. i like the game, and i still recommend it to everyone, but its just not for me.",250.9

"pkayed this wacky game for years, and ive experienced momoents of awe, terror, godliness, cleanliness, anger, and disbelief when playing this game. most of those moments are simply hoping that i can get that last fish hit in on a demoknight before the pyro, who set me on fire, airblasts me off of a cliff. and then i get head shot by a sniper. that is absolutely the typical experience, as long as you remember that killing people or capping points isnt the objective. the objective is to have fun in as many ways as physically possible.",456.9
"a solid fps, much more diverse gameplay than most others with its 8 classes. not exactly strategic, but alot of fun and easy to just jump into and kill an hour or two and maybe play with someone else with a mic and then many jokes can be had. items are great too as a way to customize gameplay further than the 8 classes with thousands of weapon combinations, normally after youve given all the classes a play and figured out how to play them; by which point youll have found a few items as drops that you can begin experimenting with.",252.7

"tf2 is an awesome game! perfectly balanced. premium players doesnt have a big advantage over the f2p players because most of the items in this game are cosmetic and i think there are no items that the premium players can have that the f2p players cant. a lot of companies need to learn from valve on how to make a f2p game, dota 2 is another good example of f2p, which is another game from valve! about the game itself: unique classes, each with their own weapons(aside from some secondary weapons like the shotgun for some classes), abilities and responsabilities on the battlefield; good graphics; teamwork is essential, otherwise it wouldnt be a team fortress game; tons and tons of achievements and overall fun!",451.7

"best multy/coop game for the pc of all times!!!!! :3",640.2
"after wasting alot of time in this game i decided to write a review. first off the game is great the gamplay is fresh alot to do and alot of nice people to play with. the game has items some like them and some hate them but i dont mind if people waste 100$ on a digital hat or just 0.07$ for a weapon. all weapon have a pros and cons to make the game fair so the people with the most money cant just buy that item. the game is alive and will be for a long time. i would say this game would be worth 19,99$. but its free and everyone can enjoy it free of cost. the game also has mvm (man versus machine) when players fight waves of evil robots to defend man co. so grab a friend and waste money on hats.",237.5
"as far as the f2p games goes, this is one of the best balanced, most established ones on steam. gameplay-wise, its exciting class-based shooter action, and if you can get 2 organized teams, it is really fun. aside from that, its free, but its a big download. give it a try anyway.",1409.5

"its a fun game and when you buy something for the first time i got 8 inventory slots and thats helpful and what the crates give you are amazing, i have to spend $74.1 on keys for 30 crates but its still a fun game. i would reccomend this even in 10 years. one last thing is, if you have tons of mann co. keys, could you give them to me? ill trade or accept them as gifts. its pretty greedy sounding but its bothering me. but still its a amazing game, a must have in your inventory",669.5
"this is literlay the best game evermade and it is recomendid great for all your free time!! :d",736.5
"this is a very balanced, fast paced non traditional fps that is a hell of a lot of fun. each class offers a different style of gameplay ranging from pyro, a destructive and offensive class, to spy, a supportive stealth class. every class has their strengths and weaknesses, and teamwork for this reason is essential because every class can be countered by another class. playing with balanced teams is very rewarding because it takes a group effort to win in any situation. i strongly reccomend this game to others and ill be plaing it for a long time.",910.1

"its free now, so theres no excuse not to play it anymore. oh yeah, hats.",444.6
"this long overdue and much loved game is a blast, class based warfare on a smaller scale than battlefield, which is nice. the game is very stylized and cartoonish, which i think is nice, because not only does it feel like a game, but its hilarious to look at. even if you die, chances are, youll be chuckling. there are 9 classes in total, and because of that diversity, the game play really feels varied. overall, team fortress 2 is a very solid class based shooter on source that will be enjoyed for many years to come",18.0
"team fortress 2 is an amazing and addictive fps designed by valve and you can collect hats! hats! so overall great game!",284.1

"tf2s wonderful. ive spent hundreds of hours enjoying this fantastic game. the one and only drawback is the kind of player mvm brings out. regular plays great.",394.9
"team fortress 2 is a fun action first-person shooter with a cartoon like style. it has a good variety of classes (my favourite is the spy) and has loads of cool items and weapons to unlock. it has lots of great maps and fun game modes from man vs. machine to capture to the flag. this is a game i totally recommened! ....unless your 6, 6 year olds are too young to be playing violent games >:( in conclusion if you dont have steam money and you want a fun cartoonic shooter to play than this is perfect for you!",38.8

"team fortress 2 (also known as hat fortress 2) is probably the best hat simulator on steam. i reccomend it to anyone looking for a hat simulator. its addictive quality, its cartoony art style and its great ammount of hats are really apealing and really give the game charm. i think graphics are the best part about games and team fortress 2 really shows off the source engine and how it can render hats with relative ease. the object of the game, as you probably know already, is to get as many hats as possible. you can get them by: a) playing a shooting minigame for about an hour a day to get a random hat drop (sometimes the random drops can be extra weapons to make the shooting minigame easier, i dont reccomend using them, though) b) crafting your shooting minigame weapons into scrap metal to make a new hat eventually c) buying the hats off of the mann co. store all in all, this is a great hat sim that i reccomend to everyone looking for a fun dressup game. i hope valve makes more.",548.3

"for the more educated people only! this game goes deep into the heart of economics where one could learn to trade various cosmetic items for metal. each hat metapohrically represents a slice of life. the more hats you have, the more you are seen as a person in-game. the gibus, however, is like a dying stock share where one could never gain any sort of profit from it. a painted gibus is the ultimate display of poverty since it displays the well-proven fact that you no longer have a hat to paint! therefore it is recommended that one takes every single stats course in school in order to understand such a deep, and well-made hat simulator. i have lost my life investing into many hats in order to maximize my virtual metal income. i highly recommend this game for those who are interested in how microeconomics work. also comes with a fps mini-game.",1443.9

"tf2 is, to put it boldly, the most fun multiplayer fps on steam, and probably on pc. call of duty it isnt, and thats a good thing. team fortress 2 is a game where you choose from one of 9 different classes, all of which are expertly balanced and offer a playstyle for everybody, and try to complete an objective with your team. teamwork is extremely important here, and those who just want to run around and do their own thing, trying to get as many kills as possible, wont last very long. every class has a weakness that can be covered by another class, and when the right combination of players get together, magic can happen. there is no reason for you not to play this game, especially since its free.",1306.5

"tf2 is a game where you shoot people with nine playable gun guys. this game is good because it runs on my gay- computer that struggled to run portal 1. the goal of the game is to look as fabulous as possible while shooting the enemy; this is achieved with the use of hats and other $wag clothing. i give it a 2/10 because all the characters are straight cis white males (with the exception of the latino demoman who earns a six figure salary) who need to check their privelage.",471.6
"a unique fps which is frequently updated and enjoyed by millions of players to this day. unfortunately for new players, there is a steep learning curve in matching up to experienced players, which i believe leads alot of new players with little patience to become frustrated. if you have enough patience to train yourself in the renowned art that is tf2, i suggest you download this game immediately, did i mention that its free? 10/10 a great game, but not something you can get into easily, unless you want to get your  handed to you several (thousand) tiems.",512.1

"60s-70s action movie feeling? sounds badass! an eye-catching exceptional graphical style resembling somewhat pixar-esque? fascinating. lots of gratuituous ,graphical and humourous violence? oh yes! gameplay, which emphasises teamwork and is most fun when you man up with your mates - in addition giving a big middle finger for the opposing team by showing them how their collective effort sucks compared to your valuable, well-forged plan? hell yeah! its team fortress 2! even though it lacks the charm of grenades and insane leet tricks which you were able to perform in team fotress and tfc (my old love~), the tf2 works as a brilliant spiritual successor for its grandfather games i loved to play too. get your hands on it - try it out, and see if you like it or not - for its free!",1407.8

"the game was very fun for all my buddys at school a year ago but after a while gets a little dull, so we joined servers with different game modes like arena. but alot of people in tf2 im guessing about 60% just play for items to sell its very annoying while playing a game. all people do is try to offer there items out to other people and then sell what they got in return. soon youll join with the trading side i give 1-3 months till your obsessed with hats and trying to get alot to sell and trade. so overall basically gameplay is good when people play. so i recommend this game just stay away from trading and youll have ablast!just trade weapons if ya wanna stay away from hats n crates and dont buy keys btw dont buy a item from store,unless you want more space just buy a 50 cent weapon and then never buy weapons again trade people for them. only weapons",1047.6

"the game is fun. the community is normally so much better than that of cods or bffs. the micro-transactions are good too. you can get almost anything from item drops in-game. and there are so many different gamemodes! you have the default ones, doomsday, ctf, cp, but then you have community made ones (that i think some should be real ones,) freak fortress 2, arena, x10, all very fun! its also very easy to record, as you can easily set up events, give yourself a challenge, or simply shoot at things! all the classes are very different as well, and can help eachother on the same team, (medic + heavy) or can destroy eachother on the opposing team, (sniper + spy or spy + pyro.) anyways, i recomend this game to everyone, even if you dislike fps games, because to be honest, this game will never be normal. its to late to go back.",792.7
"a great game that you become addicted to the minute you play it. just dont fall into the temptation to buy hats or weapons, because once you start you cannot stop, it is like a drug. but other than the incredible amount of things you can buy it is a great free to play game.",17.1
"probably a crown-jewel to multiplayer gaming! what can i say that hasnt already been said? great for both competetitve players and people just wanting a good time! with a diverse amount of game modes and classes. a great amount of fun- if you want to be good it takes practice (then again so do most things). i would also recommend watching gameplay videos from other pros just to get an idea of what or not to do! a good community, ive had plenty of laughs on this game and most of my steam friends i first met on tf2. may not be everyones cup of tea, but its free, and if you love playing online- this is, without a doubt, woth a try! also hats; hatz, u got hats? pllssssss!!! i neeeeeeeeeed hatz, dont want a cold scalp... sorry about that- hats do things to you :p in all seriousness a definite recommendation!",1248.7

"im so sry that i just cant play this game anymore... maybe its because of all that robots updates and tons of new weapons add a competitive 5vs5 or 9vs9 with ranks like cs go and there would be sense for old school gamers like me (that are f*** annoyed by ppl that try to trade ingame instead of pushing the cart) it feels like no one cares playing the objective,everyone is just running around like an idiot trying to get 360 noscopes and what so ever but still, i cannot downvote this game cause i had a great time, enjoyed it even more than counterstrike or any other games out there",851.6

"its a fun game to play but hard to master. it takes time to get used to the controls and the feel of the game. you may want to spend a few bucks to just get started which allows you to get a preium account which allows you to trade and get all of the weapons team fortress 2 has to affer. over all its a good game to play and pretty high quility for a free game.",20.5

"it is really addicting game with great gameplay. drop system boosting fun, but trading can be kinda annoying.",814.2
"i would reccomend this game to anyone that wants a really epic, fun, exiting and tense f2p fps game. not only is it free but as i allready stated its incredably fun! the gamemodes, payload where you get your cart to the end of the track, koth (king of the hill) where the team can hold the point for 3 minutes, then theres cp which is a capture point where one team trys to capture the point and the other defends and lots more! another thing is trading! all the different types of weapons and hats you can trade with other players like trading cards or cs:go weps. the best is the classes; scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, meidc, sniper and spy! spy is personaly my favourite and if you havent got this game your missing out so if you havent go and download it now!!",268.7

"i love the game, one problem is that the game hounds you for cash any time it can, with most of the earnable items non-marketable (dont even think about trading until you get premium status), the game just loves microtransactions. the gameplay is really funny and easy to just pick up and get good at. i would suggest this for veterans who are tired of shooter games in general, but have not given up on the genre 8.75/10",38.2

"team fortress 2 is a twist to the multiplayer fps games, as each character as some kind of special skill to their advantage. the game has the simple capture the flag and king of the hill gamemodes, it also has new gamemodes that no other fps multiplayer game has or uses. these new gamemodes are terriotorial control, payload, payload races, special delivery and the mann vs. machine mode. the weapons have four ways of being obtained which helps players get better, the first way is it being randomly dropped or given in mann-up mode for mann vs. machine, the other two are buying the items or opening crates. this game has its ups and downs, mostly with the spy class as its very hard to be sneaky with pyros around or the fact that the uber charge is great in a choke point. this games best part is finding that perfect class or weapon that really helps you in the long run. this game is a 10/10, the only problem i have is when players that are medics completly ignore you when you need them the most.",554.5

"what can i say about this game? well, for one it is a great game. it is well thought out, with 9 classes it is a unique experience compared to other fps games. you dont just use a machine guns and kill everyone you see. you can build a sentry gun, backstab your enemys, smack a ball to your opponenets face etc. with the vast amount of weapons and achievements youll be busy and hooked on this game. for it is a task to master using all 9 classes and familiarising yourself with the gamemodes and the unique mann vs. machine. if you ever get curious try it out, i assure you that you will enjoy this game.",1212.3

"awesome !! its is fun, its addictive. im playing with my friends all day long.",27.6
"at its core it is a solid game with classes that seem over powered but are countered by other classes due to different strengths and weaknesses. its not a game you can really get first time playing, but once you have worked out how to use weapons its so much fun. and thats only a part of tf2, theres trading, servers with mods as well as training for rocket jumps and its always constantly being updated. you have no excuse to not try this game. i am sure you wont be disappointed.",2372.0
"this game is amazing. i had been wanting to play this for the longest time. it was actually the main reason why i made a steam account. i became a huge fan immediately. this game is very different from the fps games you see today, aside from the cartoonish style. there are nine classes to choose from and when you begin to play, there is an optional tutorial for each class. there is also an offline practice mode, which is great if you want to try each class and find out which one suits you best. i love the humor and the style. this game is very unique. im an old school shooter fan, especially id softwares games, and it really appeals to me. if youre sick of modern shooters (*cough* call of duty *cough cough*), im sure youll enjoy tf2.",401.8
"i have played tf2 for a long time and it still doesnt get old, sure there are some weapons i wish werent in the game because they hurt me all the time but then i look down at my bow and grin because as a great man once said youre makin this too easy, im actually gettin worse",897.2
"this is a really fun and interresting game. play with friends for a better experience",523.5
"i love tf2, however, some serious things need to be changed. for one, most times when i join a server, i see the number of people that are in game are completely different from what the amount says. its not small either, ill see one that says theres 25 players on but in reality theres zero. even if i refresh the page, same results. also, the main complaint i have is the random gifting. that is bull, i dont want to send an important gift to my friend just to find it was sent to someone i dont even know. im well aware it says that it will send it randomly to someone, but my point is, it shouldnt be random to begin with. not having them tradable either is pretty bad too. i seriously recommend changing that.",616.2
"what can i say, its a fun game. if your a fan of fps or like games where you can make your character look fabulous, then this is a game for you. ive seen people who have thousands of hours invested into this game and probably just as much money. even if youve played all the maps, beat every mvm, and completed every achievement, youve still only played half the game. yes, tf2 is an fps on the surface but, its more than that. its a game that has a bustling trading market of weapons, games, apparell, and items for other games (ive seen pokemon deals on some trade servers). all in all, its a pretty fun game.",616.4

"if there is anything to team fortress 2 is how impressive and repeatative it is for new players and veterans at this game. people always come back for a little more than what they intentionally wanted from a free game, and it delivers. valve has created a game based on the principles of character custimization, user interface, and profittable material, all in the name of the user. no other game so far has given this amount of freedom to anyone, and has surpassed expectations of what games could become. and while the game lacks detailed maps and graphics expected from newer games today, it is important to realize that the story, mechanics, and community of a game matter much more than some fancy particle effects, such as starcraft 1 compared to cod series. i highly recommend supporting community made content and play this with your friends. if there is anyone who has never heard of steam or tf2, they should absolutly try this first. enjoy this great game.",619.1

"who ever thought that such an awesome game would be free? with awesome graphicsa and gameplay, and thousands of amazingly fun servers out there, you wont want to give this game a miss! the character designs add to the game to make it more cartoonish and fun, (while still keeping heaps of blood) and with each class perfectly crafted, youll never get bored! i definetely reccomend this game to hardcore and casual gaming. also, you dont really need a good operating system to run the game smoothly!",351.6

"i dont know why you wouldnt play this game. its a masterpiece! the game is well thought out and will always have a way to expand the game with new ideas, hats, and gamemodes. the characters have a great backstory if you ever read the comics. also all the characters have their advantages. like the pyro against the spy, or the other way with the heavy and the medic. my only complant is that they should make more weapons for the classes not just redo them and give them a diferent aspect. like the vintage/genuine, but now the australium weapons. which is fine, but i would like some more weapons to be put into the game not just redos of older weapons. overall this game is a masterpiece and i would give it at least a try. rating 5 stars. complants: need more weapons.",341.4

"team fortress 2 is a deep and artistic story driven fpae ( first person artistic experience ) that is a must play for all. what starts as a typical military story about a young boy named nogames forced into a war against his will evolves into a dramatic well paced plot involving a hat conspiracy and overt religious themes. i was literaly left in tears at the twist ending. check this game out if you want a truly well written game that isnt afraid to delve into the controversial relationship human beings have with hats and religion. the only fault this game has is that it falls apart midway into the series when a new character named gaben is introduced and starts to take the light away from the more developed characters like robin. also the lead character nogames never truly matures although this is partially intended to represent the human condition of hats. either way this is a unique game and if youre not afraid to try something new and different then play tf2.",492.3

"i have to say, team fortress 2 is one of the very few shooters that i enjoy. i have been playing for over a year now and the game offers a lot of action, humor and fun! and of course, lets not forget the hats, never forget the hats. in my opinion, they need to make a few weapons better. for example, the quick-fix; a medi gun that heals very quickly, but only over-heals you about 50% while other medi guns heal about 125%, seems like a good combination right? problem is its bercharge does not make you invunerable or gives you critical hits, it only heals even quicker. what i think they should do for the bercharge is it should last even longer than the normal bercharge. overall, this game is fun to enjoy and play with friends. i highly recommend this game.",2781.2
"this is a game designed for just a fun time with friends, and it kept in mind all the competitive players out there who like a good challenge when playing against other skilled players. team fortress 2 is a game based around team work, without it even the most skilled players would have a tough time competing. overall, it is just a wacky fun game, take it for what it is, and dont be an  about it.",369.0
"ok: to the point. this game, in all its glory, is a class-based shooter game with challenging achievements, creative maps, and intresting classes with excellant voice-acting. however, if you really want to be good at this game and develop a high amount of skill, dont expect that to come easily. this aint cod, alright? there are stats, that matter, and can completely ruin the game if you arent going to, you guessed it, reeeeeeeaaaaaad! it isnt hard! take some time and figure out the diffrance between the classic, the original, and the bottle! albeit a free game, if you want to be good, then youd better save up your money for some weapons. if you want respect, buy some cosmetics. (note: the ghostly gibus doesnt count, and neither do the pyrovision goggles, which are achievement items.) all in all, a challenging game that took a step away from the normal shooter that truely was a beautiful creation that i reccomend to anyone with the patience to play.",250.4
"free-to-play hat collecting simulator. whats not to like?",98.6
"hello! welcome to tf2! this is one of the most funny games but belvie me if youre a competitive player you shouldnt try it.i played this game like 500h and i will show you my opinion about this game.i will do pro and cons. pro : -envolve teamwork -f2p game -funny and challenging -updates every month ( ex. : mvm, hats n miscs , wepons,taunts) -easy classes (ex : pryo) -tf2 trading cons: - not blanched (ex. scout deals a lot of damage if he is close to the traget,but he very vulnarable.one pipe mean more then 100 hp and he has 125 hp. - makes you angry sometimes. -as i said before you need a good team. (ex : if you play as spy your team should distract the enamy attention to backstab them more easly ) -broken wepons ( ex : plog,soda poper,direct hit,force of nature etc...) i realy hope you like my review and i recommend this game for every steam user who likes trying new experiences",769.5

"team fortress 2 is literally my favorite game of all time. this game is great for free to plays and pay to plays. for free to plays, you have stock weapons which are actually very balanced, and with the drop system you can get any weapon with different stats, (ecxept reskins and hats and misc. but they do matter in terms of stats.) you can play against a pay to play and win, because its really about skill and experience. where the game shines is really in its community. most people are generally ecxepting of noobs. mainly because the game features so many silly things to play around with. its also refreshing from your average realistic military fps. i personally like the sort of cartoony artstyle of the game. theres so much im leaving out about this game, but if this is reason enough for you to buy it, youre crazy! its free god dammit!",928.6
"one of the greatest games ever made. an fps that is like no other fps you have ever played, or you will ever play. and if you have a steam account, you have to play tf2 at least once. its an initiation. it has a relatively shallow learning curve and is friendly to players of all skill levels. the first match i ever played on were on skial servers... and i didnt get that torn apart. but trust me, scrub or superb, this game has a place for you. but it is not for the faint hearted... nah, that is incorrect. if you are god awful at call of duty, then play this game; you will be good. if you are an m.l.g. pro level c.o.d. player, stay away. this game will blow your mind with all its non-fps-like nuances. i recommend this game with the all my heart... what ever is left of it after... and that is how i lost my medical license!!! -future soldier, signing off",406.2

"my opinion: tf2 is a really interesting game with a creative cartoon style and some fast-paced gameplay. each class has different tactics than the other, and you have to figure out how to overcome the oppenents strategies. as i mentioned previously, the art style is really cool, and the classes have their own personalities to boot. the inventory/loadout system is also convenient - you choose how you play each class. the only problems that i see are a couple of bad egg players and small children who should be elsewhere. but hey, valve added both a report and a mute button! for free? definitely get this game.",599.5

"this game has been around for almost 7 years might go for its tenth year and i could see why. what i like about this game is how well its balanced, not just in weapons but in the classes themselves. every class and its gun has its up and downs. no sense of it being a pay-to-win game. cheapest gun is low as 0.49 cents and as i said before alot of the guns are fairly balanced. oh yeah you cant forget about the hats... hats hats hats!!!!! you can customize your charactor with whatever apperal or hats. whether you wanna make look badass or just flat out stupid the choices are yours. some people could say that hats are killing the games. alot of the updates has just hats and it could be annoying, buts the hat could go either way. the hats has open up a new world for tf2 but there is more hats then there is guns. but i could see why its pretty hard to make a gun that is fairly balanced. so i would say this game gats a 9/10",175.3

"wonderful game! cartoony, yet still appeals to the more bloodthirsty players. it is the best free to play system i have yet to find, with no way to shoot ahead by paying money. and most of the weapons are balanced, so new players can still feel like they can do as much as someone who has 300+ hours on the game. and it has a extremely large playerbase, who put out just as much if not more content than the developers themselves! its a great game, and not to mention free! the only mistake would be to not try it.",256.8

"very balanced game. every class has strengths and weaknesses. i.e. spies are weak against pyros that routinely check for spies, engineers (the guys that set up sentries and ammo/health refillers called dispensers) are constantly looking around for spies as spies can destroy their buildings. if you lose, the only reason you lost is the other team were better than yours. period. and i dont mean you. this is a team game. if you cant work as a team, you will lose.",155.4

"i personally think it is overrated by miles. it was fun and everything but it didnt hours of appeal like everyone said it would. the game is plagued by microtransactions, but thats to be expected from a free game. if you like to animate with source film maker this is the game works beautifully with it. the core mechanics are decent and nothing was really unfair (except the spy). the claasses offer variety of gameplay styles to suit everyone. if you want to be big and slow but dish out legions of damage the the heavy is your class. like running around and stbbing people? play the spy. the maps are unique i n their own way and the modes work well with the masp. should you play this game? yes, but dont expect it to be the best thing ever",5.6

"amazing game that is really the backbone of steam. an insane amount of time has been poured into this game by the developers, the community, the players, the traders. the first few hours you play, youll probably be massacred and have something like a 1:10 kill-death ratio, but after a while, youll play late into the night, hacking away at peoples heads and lighting them aflame. if you have not downloaded this yet, i strongly reccomend you do so.",893.8

"you probably know what this game is. lets be honest, everyone has probably heard of team fortress 2 the moment they got on steam. team fortress 2 is a free-to-play shooter with a cartoony art style, and an unusual way of playing that sets it apart from other shooters. in team fortress 2, there are 9 classes, each with its weaknesses and advantages. along with the basic shooting, classes have their own unique abilities that help on the battlefield. however, this game is not only famous for the click & shoot, it has one of the most interesting (and complicated) economy that i enjoy to participate in. you can work your way up to be able trade in-game items for actual steam games. this game also doesnt tax your machine and even on low settings is lovable with its computer-friendly artstyle. even though its been released a long time ago, team fortress 2 still maintains its freshness and uniqueness.",1344.9

"pros: -decent overall balanced fps -free to play but not a pay 2 win all non-cosmetic items can be aquired without ingame purchases at all -well optimized -fully rebindable controls and fov -community made content -large array of different gamemodes and maps cons: -constant stream of children coming in from games like cod and complaining about how the game isnt cod (quit crying) -some weapons/tactics are op/rage inducing/just plain dumb -people come into the game with no idea what to do (at least watch some gameplay) -large quantities of community made servers run pay 2 win donation systems (these dont come from the game just the server hosts themselves) overall: tf2 is a fun game overall its just it lacks the full support from valve who instead of listening to the community about bugs/broken weapons/exploits will just keep adding in more items to keep making money from it. i will post as positive but remain in a sort of 50/50 state about the game.",633.6

"the best thing about this game is that there is no noticeable difference between those who pay for in game items against those who dont, because the default weapons are some of the best you can have. the game is very fun, and the variety of classes, maps, gamemodes, and servers make this an epic fps experience. if you are a hardcore cod or battlefield player (like me) then you may have trouble getting used to it, but the game is great after you get used to it.",822.9

"its a very fun game with different game modes and mods. many people emphasize on hats and some compare those free to play players and premiums. but most of the community are very friendly and helpful. there is a trading side of tf2, a playing side and even a competitive side. mge (my gaming edge), hl (highlander) and 6s (6v6) are all forms of competitive while mge being a mod itself (1v1). overall, great game and community, highly suggest you buy it (just dont idle so much) and i mean buy, not play. you can play it for a trail but the trading aspect is great as well. but most clans wouldnt mind if you are a f2p (free to play) as long as you are gd at gaming and are friendly, you will most probably enter a clan (if u ask) and bond with them.",1176.2
"in all terms, i am speechless at this game. with nine classes to choose from and many weapons to pick, i have to say this is probably the best multiplayer game of the pc. keep in mind, however, you actually have to use teamwork with your teammates in order to win rounds.",260.0

"gameplay is extremly fun and balanced, with differant gamemodes changing your offensive or defensive tactics. to suceed, you have to pick a couple classes and attempt to master their position on the field. which is very fun. although f2p, tf2 could easily be considered a 15 dollar game, with a extremely stong community, helping put out updates which sometimes live up the the hype. *cough* end of the line *cough* mixing together a wonderful blend of well-rounded classes with actually interesting backstories, this game is one of my favorite games of all time. 10/10, would slap a heavy with a fish again.",490.9

"i find that this game used to be more than it is. the players have grown more arrogant and hypocritical. for example if you were to have played this game for say 2 hours (with bots and tutorials), the other players on your team might simply ignore and laugh at you rather than helping you. i have also seen people play soldieer/pyro and saying that you suck every time they kill you (a more common term is rekt). the tutorial is very helpful and some players are very polite and nice, but some are within the age limit (say 5 years of age) i have wasted too much time in this game but like putin (of heavys homeland) i say this game has 140% of my support. ;3",912.9

"a great game overall i really quit enjoy it. easy to use and fit characters with different weapons or estetics such as the hats. i very much recommend this game to people who like first person shooters because of tf2s collection of classes ranging from a quick and agile scout which is vey good for offence or the slow but powerful heavy weapons class which fetures a minigun great for keeping enemies back. i do believe that everyone should give this game a try based on its incredible ability to make me play for a whole 8 or so hours in one sitting before i finally shut down the game.",246.6

"tf2, an amazing shooter for its age and the first shooter that i have competitively played, sadly the competitive communtity is not really big and it is all community based and not greatly supported by the publishers. it offers a really interesting gameplay with the 9 classes that are available, a great fun for the casual gamer aswell as the player searching for competitive experience. despite the fact that it is older than 7 years valve still puts some time into making updates for this game although most of them just feature items and no game changing content. it was a good time! bye bye tf2!",2457.8
"get tf2. it may have a few bugs (all of which are fixed in patches) but it is still a very good game. it isnt very optomized for macs, so try to play it on pc instead. the game is well balanced, suits practically every playing style out there. the community of the game, from my experience, is alright, a lot better than cod, but can still get a bit annoying sometimes.",218.2

"i used to play this game a lot for the in-game economy but then csgo got one too. i like the balance of the classes and the equipement unlockables and craftables. most offer a moderate enhancement while normally nerfing another of your attributes, equally. better items do that more drasticly or have decent buffs with little to no costs. i cant stress how much i liked drops and trading so i moved on to csgo for that reason, 363 hours in that game at the time of writing this, so prepare for valves poison to set in as you get suckered into trading, crafting, then crate drops, crate keys, then cards, then steam levels, its what they want.",36.7

"my favorite game ever. best community, best gameplay, best youtube content, funniest moments, amazing graphics, a good, expanding storyline, anything you could want in a game. i especially love the class-based strategies. even better is that instead of getting better and better items as you play, you get items that customize your gameplay. get the crusaders crossbow instead of the syringe gun if you are a good shot. get ali babas wee booties and the charge m targe to run around charging like a maniac. also, there arent any im mlg pro 360 noscope across the map kind of people i loathe.",479.6

"tf2 is the most popular free-to-play game of the pc gaming community. its absolutely awesome right of of download, and gets even better after the steep learning curve of the game. there are so many different things you can do while in the crazy combat. for example, as a soldier you can rocket jump to jump across the map much faster than walking and jump to higher places for a tactical advantage. tf2 has many game modes, such as payload, control points, and king of the hill, that are well made for the style of game. i do think, however, that team fortress should add some new game modes for a coming update. i think a new game mode such as infected type of game and an official death run and boss modes would be awesome! see you playing!",1378.5

"the core game is fine, its not p2w, the most important items are dropped via achievements, and the stock items are in many cases the best anyways. what for me destroys the game is the focus on hats or general cosmetic items. for the most part of the community and valve now, its no longer about the gameplay. it really is for many players just the hat simulator #1, and thats just not my thing. i recommend the game regardless, because although the game can be better if they would focus more on the gameplay, its a solid shooter with a good class system and a nice art style.",457.5

"this game is diffrent from any other dull fps. the classes feel alive and all have there streghts and weaknesses. you cant quickscope which is great. you have to charge up your shots as sniper. you cant insta kill with a knife, you have to backstab as a spy. overall this game takes alot of practice and strategy. great game!!!",52.9

"even though its been out for a long time, it is still a very fun game. there are 9 different classes, (one example is scout which can run really fast and double jump) they each have their own styles. i really love this game because unlike other games where you can change your gun giving maybe a -1% accuracy or somethibg, changing items in this game can make a huge deal. there are also lots of new updates that come out and cool hats, suits, etc. all these things make the game really fun to play. i would recommend this game. 1010 in my book.",1376.0

"this game is just a gift from the gods, its free to play and that makes this game just a masterpiece. youll never bore yourself and its easy to learn. despite the fact that there are a lot of microtransactions, it always is rewarding for what you get. the fan community is a bit awkward because most kids (5-10 years old) want to start this game and think this is cod. this game could be a part of the esports community, but the matches are too short in my opinion. matchmaking works fine and i dont have any more complaints about the game. keep up the good work valve!",323.6

"best fps ever online is good fps to play 10 out of 10",22.5
"this game is the best thing since sliced bread. in fact its better than sliced bread, because it has sliced bread (see sandvich). the only problem is that sliced bread doesnt have a 7 gb file size. which is annoying, especially if you have a 10gb broadband allowance. bt will chase you with a shotgun, but the months in hospital are worth it. until you realise your hub is crap. still 10/10 though. because engies arent affected by lag (or the laws of physics) yeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw!",228.5

"despite the fps genre being smashed into the ground with crappy games as of late and is way overdone, team fortress 2 provides a refreshing and action-packed experience for an otherwise overdone genre. there are gamemodes you cant find in any other fps, the large variety of classes keeps the game interesting and suits any play style, the action is intense and addictive, the nonstandard weapons are fun to use and have their own unique twists (i, for one, like the soda popper: it allows you to jump insanely high after charging up at the cost of a much smaller clip size), and this game is 100% free! you can still pay money to get certain things if you want them, but it is completely optional, which i applaud. if your computer can run this game, what are you waiting for? team fortress 2 gets a +9 on the scale of -10 to +10.",78.2

(2fort) (i started playing when it was quake team fortress back in 99). i enjoy being able to customize my character now with cosmetics because it gives a sense of uniqueness to your character. i enjoy going demoman and decapitating a plethora of players. if you enjoy non-sense, funny dialogue from characters, non-stop mayhem, a very well-balanced game for the most part, doing conga lines, etc. this is the game for you.",2773.1

"a fantastic team based shooter with vibrant classes that all stick out. the mechanics are great and the fact that you need to rely on your teammates to win the game instead of just going crazy with your smg gives the game an interesting twist compared to other fps games. the game feels fair to me with items recently being tweaked in every update to make the game more fun for everyone. every class has their strengths and weaknesses and it makes you learn placement and timing for you to get revenge on that soldier who killed you last life. i genuinely enjoy team fortress 2 and its one of the best made games that ive ever played. hopefully youll be able to enjoy tf2 like i do. edit: eotl killed tf2",2114.3

"first, let me just say that this game is the most amazing fps i own at the time. do you know what makes this even better? its free! yes, of course they require you to pay to purchase items in the store. you also have to buy one item to get upgraded to premium. this allows you to trade. luckily, you can still experience the game quite well without spending your dough. the trading element to the game is wonderful. who ever thought to add a trading mechanic to an fps? certainly not activision (call of duty designers), thats for sure. valve managed to incorperate the perfict balance of comedy, along side the seriousness of a tacticle fps. the nine classes are so unique, and they can all work in unison, in order to lead you and your team to victory. in my opinion, the only thing this game lacks are more weapons, and a team death match game mode. i rate this game 9.2 rare hats out of 10.",125.4

"what i like about this game are the hats,the weapons,and the tasks to get achievements. i picked the tasks to get achievements because some of them are fun and some are hilarious (in my opinion of course). i picked hats because the varieties (idk if i spelled that right) and they are funny and cool same with the weapons. that is what i like about tf2. what i dislike is that there are lots of bugs that still need to be fixed but other than that i think the game is amazing. :)",936.0

"what can i say about this game? well, for one it is a great game. it is well thought out, with 9 classes it is a unique experience compared to other fps games. you dont just use a machine guns and kill everyone you see. you can build a sentry gun, backstab your enemys, smack a ball to your opponenets face etc. with the vast amount of weapons and achievements youll be busy and hooked on this game. for it is a task to master using all 9 classes and familiarising yourself with the gamemodes and the unique mann vs. machine. if you ever get curious try it out, i assure you that you will enjoy this game.",1212.3

(sort of replaced with flare gun) other then that team fortress has become this beast of action and murder that just doesnt let up for a moment. fast repawns and huge servers just make the momentum unbeleivable with a very short learning curve. one more thing about tf2, its that you never know when there will be more maps or gameplay changes. the game doesnt want to be labled just one thing, it just keeps changing. i cant wait to see how this game stays relevant while it slowly gets taken over by item s who dont care about anything else then collecting items and sitting in farming servers during special events. good work valve, keep it up!(episode 3?!?!)",1250.0

"want a game that has deceptively simple mechanics, lively characters, and just about every other thing you have come to expect from valve? tf2 has all the multiplayer and co-op goodness you could want. depending on how high your expectations are. one notable feature is the skill-curve, which separates the playing field, is actually dependent on the players abilities, and not a gun-game like xp system (ie:unlocks & pay to play perks). add to that a class system that caters to a variety of play styles and strategies and you have one of the best multiplayer shooters of all time. its free, also.",1108.2

"this game could possibly be the best and most balenced game on steam. and its free. every single weapon in the game is made so that its not overpowered and not underpowered. there are updates all the time adjusting weapons to make them more balenced. you also start out with the most viable weapons in the game: the stock weapons. you can get more weapons, but theyre situational and shine at some points and are dull at others. the stock weapons can be used in almost any situation. the artwork is also fantastic and the charaters have great personalities, almost like theyre real. oh, and one more thing. hats.",1847.3

"i love this game. i love that it is free to download. it can be a bit annoying that the download takes a while but this game has been going through a lot of updates so the wait is worth it. my favorite class is the engineer and i wish one day valve will let me find my first australium weapon for the engineer.

"would recommend for people who like ctf,koth and other game modes.one of the reasons why is because of hats and misc iteams.there 9 classes that you can be.an other reason why is because fo weapons and you can play with your friends and go to competetive servers and achivement/friendly servers.really good game.",1201.2
"now, team fortress is like pay to win but also just get luck and get this item concept. this is stuff youll notice a lot. but this game is fun with the multiplayer and mvm/manvsmachine plus the events. some times its completly boring. ive been playing this for over a year and i would rate this no but to tell you the truth. it,s fun when you actually play with friends and not total strangers and idiots out there. i hoped this helped you",18.1

"this was one of my favourite games for a very long time (as you can see) the gameplay is very solid and alot of fun with friends or even on your own. the downside for me was the introduction of the free 2 play and annoying weapons that rewarded gameplay as simple as airblasting somebody into the air and then shooting them with a speical shotgun to do mini-critical damage. weapon combos like this ruined the game for me because soon enough everybody starts to do it and the varitity starts to fade away. 7/10 good fun, but after a long while you may be grumpy like me.",2233.4

"okay, this is one of the best fps games out there. here, let me list pros and cons. pros: variety of classes. many oufits to customize your mercenary. fun, fast, and action packed gameplay. cartoony yet brutal look(its like pixar with blood and guns.) actual teamwork is invovled. large trading servers(yes this game has a friggin economy.) it isnt super serious, theres humor. each class has special powers and weaknesses to play off of. free to play. cons: hats and clothes can be too expensive. some weapons are a bit too op(cough cough, philog, cough cough.) updates can lead to dissappointment. some weapons are just crappy. some maps have chokehold parts(parts where one team has a serious advantage over the other becuase of their territory.) thats really it! honestly, this game is very different from other games like call of duty, but i recommend you give it try. once youre in, its pretty addicting. 9/10",634.0

"------------------ trading ------------------ in my opinion, this game is only used as a filter to make money by trading. people trade their weapons that theyve found to get better things. in example, i would sell my scrap metal for 2 weapons, and then sell both weapons for 1 scrap metal a peice. there are many a.i. bots that steal accounts because of the items in this game. lets say you use third-party websites to trade, a bot will add you almost immediately after. they usually say how their friend wants to trade us, and then send a phishing link. you always have to be cautious around people, they could be scammers. i oonly reccomend trading in this game for people who have 2 accounts.",746.6

"do you like those big mmo games with cosmetic items like hats, shirts, and weapons? do you love to play a game with multiple challenging gamemodes? do you like a game that updates with new items at the right time? then tf2 is the game for you. the cartoon like graphics are just great and i love the looks, and there isnt alot of glitches or bugs.besides the now and again encounter of internet trolls/jerks there really isnt anything i see wrong with this game. and for people who complainabout class balance no need for this game the classes are allequally perfect ballance in the hole game. personally i love the game and i recomend it to all big mmo players.",215.6
"amazing game, great variety in-game store and items, all around epic action. the only problem is getting everyone to work as a team to win. too many cod players and people who dont care come on here and play like they are the best of all time. and f2p (free-to-play) racism is super thick on alot of servers. if you can manage that though, this is worth every penny.",633.1

"team fortress 2 is what used to be the most fun you can have online per dollar. sadly though, the most fun you can have online is now being divided by zero forever. while losing the metric to measure fun sabotaged numeric logic, team fortress 2 is still draining bandwidths and lives out of mercenaries around the globe. valves fascinating love complex with its fan-boys has certainly kept the most fun you can have online refreshing. although on one hand i do not recommend anyone picking this game up because i feel there will be no closure to this ever changing game, i cant deny the fact that the game now needs no advertisement because like drugs team fortress 2 sells itself due to its many astonishing qualities. kids, please dont do drugs.",1832.9

"team fortress 2 is one of the finest games ive played for a long time. the class based warfare, unlike all other games of its type, is more fun than being one of the many militaristic shooters we see too much of today. fish, human urine, invisibility watches, icicles, ninja swords, and shards of volcanic rock make it into the huge roster of weaponry, with hundreds(!) more to be found at random points when playing. if you dont think you should buy it, you dont have to; you can play tf2 for free, but you wont have as much fun as when you play it premium. so, i highly recommend this game, for its deviation from the modern-day generic first-person military shooty swearathon ixvvvix! style of play.",1202.1

"should write a real review for this game. when tf2 started, it was a game with no weapon customization. nowadays, the game is defined by weapons instead of classes itself. skill is completely seperate from the realms of class capability and weapon capability. but that doesnt mean that performance is. if you are going to play on any server with all weapons allowed, there is a lot going against you no matter what. generally, no matter what strategy you adhere yourself to, there is a weapon designed to deal with that. if there was a world without latency, perhaps this would not be an issue. when a player plays on a big server, and things like alltalk and good communication are not used as they are in competitive play, the player has a greater chance of becoming the victim of a weapon specifically designed to feed off an unusual situation. in summary, tf2 is basically a two-team struggle against poor game mechanics.",1057.8

"well...tf2 where do i start. this game is, in my opinion, one of the best games on steam. the graphics are cartooney and it doesnt force you to make lots of microtransactions. the gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master as you never know what your opponent will do next or if theres a spy behind you, just itching to backstab. so to sum it all up, i highly reccomend this game.",213.1

"team fortress 2 is a fairly limited package. it is a good - at times very fun, at others frustrating - experience that doesnt feel very rewarding but throws quite a few enjoyable hours of gameplay at you. it is plagued by connection issues (though thankfully not as bad as that of games like dead nation), menu audio glitches, a community with a lot of players who seem to forget its a team-based game and a store that tries to rob you in shocking ways. however, what is most important is that it can be highly entertaining most of the time and it has become free-to-play in june of 2011. though, whilst not bad, its probably one of the most overrated games of all time and receives way more praise than it deserves.",5.6

"its hard to become bored with this game. between the updates, new items, and community based around it, id give tf2 an overwhelmingly positive rating. its competitive, but with a light twist. the personalities of each class definitely contribute to the love as well. it sucks you in, so much so that you begin alienating friends, family, pets, and before you know it youve logged over a thousand hours and youre living behind starbucks in a cardboard box, subsisting on coffee and wifi like a leech. but in your heart you know that it was all worth it, and that everyone and everything not related to tf2 is a distraction keeping you from playing tf2",1096.5

"dont buy this game if you would like to see the outside every once and awhile. in all seriousness this is a shooter that has a huge following, for good reason. most of the classes feel balanced, even though if you specialize in one class they wont. the greatest thing about this game is its not pay-2-win. most of the weapons you get in the game are actually just side-upgrades from the regular weapons. in fact, many times the main weapon is the weapons you use most of the time. defiantly download, after all, its free,",156.9

"the fact that this game still has me hooked after all this time is a testament to the game itself. the skill ceiling in tf2 is completely different to most other games because it is really all movement rather that just clicking on someone. if you can rocket jump well and know where all the healthpacks are you can completely roll another team, but then there might be someone who is really good at sticky jumping who just jumps up to you and hits you in the face with a grenade on a stick, and youre like what the  what that? that is why i love this game, becuase i so often have to ask myself, what the  was that? or, what the  was he doing? great game. 10/10 5/5 69/420 professionalkillstreak/unusual",523.1

"ive spent over 2,000 hours (give or take with idle) and i must say it is single handedly the best game for a free to play to pick up. it has 9 diverse classes and an easy to pickup combat system, aswell as that tons of different game modes for players to use. as well as being so diverse, the game has endless fun and humour aswell as a insanely high skill level that i would say would be almost impossible to master. whether its a scouts hit-scanning ability or a soldiers ability to airshot fluently or just an engineers sentry placement the hours you invent so master these skills leaves anyone on their toes and wanting to play more. i definetely rate this game a 10/10 and recommend it to anyone.",2188.8
"tf2 is one of the best first person shooters ive have ever played. i honestly think this is what people should play hours upon hours. this game proves that you dont need realistic graphics, or a story to have a great game. and it shows how much potential a game can have when in a 9 year development cycle.",973.0

"team fortress 2 is a class-based mmo + fps war-themed hat simulator for the pc and mac. originally it was a faithful recreation of the original quake and half-life mods, but has since evolved from its original design into a pointless virtual collect-a-thon where the player must collect every rare item they can by any means necessary, in order to inflate their ego and show off their e-peen. the original point of the game revolved around playing game modes such as capturing the enemy intelligence, pushing a bomb to the enemy base, or controlling a whole map by scout-rushing control points, but now all this is nothing more than a small mini-game to pass the time with while you wait for more weapons and rare items to magically drop into your inventory while doing  all on achievement, trade, idle or non-serious, fun-oriented servers. tl ; dr edition - collecting virtual hats makes you cool, and makes everybody jealous of you.",501.7

"tf2 is a free first person shooter made by valve corp. it has everything a game needs, hats, explosions, guns, plenty of maps, and a thriving, nice almost all the time community. this game is perfection, never being stale, the reason for this is because there are so many different weapons, there are almost endless possible loadouts. the 9 classes all have enjoyable personalities, and hilarious humor, and every class is well balanced and fun in some way. the classes have different moving speeds, so sometimes catching up to someone is a real pain sometimes. thats a small problem, but tf2 is a 10/10 game, and deserves the praise it gets.",1271.7

"this is a great game, very interesting, different gamemodes, fun with friends. i love the option to trade or just to generally play the game. the trading is very fun in my opinion because it relates to real life, because nothing is free. it is fun for ever, and you can collect hat, weapons, and miscs to customize your character or just to give him another feel. 9.5/10",326.7
"the people who still play are on trade servers. everyone else usually have just downloaded the game. the community is dying. valve doesnt care about it anymore. its just cosmetics in updates now. the weapons that are rarely introduced are 100% useless. if you do decide to download it, just use the stock, or normal items they give you.",935.5

"this game was insanely good when it came out, balanced classes and weapons, alot of variety in a fps shooter, characters you enjoy when they shout stuff after shooting a enemy, and great valve servers, but over the years, ive seen this game plunged into darkness. first off, this game now-a-days is mostly about the hats and what is the most expensive item, pretty much trading. most games like cs:go and plenty of others are falling into this hole, having no hope of going back to once was a great and balanced game, is now full of f2ps begging for free stuff, people spamming chat with items they are trying to sell, and mothers not watching their kids play. overall, i would not recommend this game.",1764.4
"i cannot recommend this game, back when i first played, this game wasnt all about hats and miscs, trading ruined the entire experience for me. the community at this point and time is absolutely disgusting, as many dont even focus on the objective and instead feel like doing the conga and trading with each other is more important. also, valve thinks its a good idea to reskin weapons instead of releasing new ones.",728.7
"re-review so, i played this game for about 560 hours, or close to it, and i have to say, i was not entirely enjoyable from the time i began to now there has certainly been a degrading quality in the community,market and game. on the community aspect, it seems that, for the unfortunate turn, many have left and those who remain have no real business in playing anything well (case and point mvm). the market has crashed essentaliy putting my 2 years of trading work going to the dumpster, and of course everyone moved to the csgo market. the game overall has had little content changes and barely anything new concerning gameplay, of course valves hat fetish has gotten the best of them. i can honestly say that while this game is free to play i spent quite a bit on it, and i really do regret it.",559.4

"the purest example of freemium gaming, if i could delete all these hours i would for its a disgrace that i wasted so much of my life in this game. player segregation, playing off addiction, pay to enjoy, concept ripping, luring new players with little effort into actually progressing the game, it is the purest example of manipulative entertainment created by unpassionate businessmen right next to candy crush. this game is scum, the people who run it are also scum, a carbon cookie cutter copy of the cash cow templet. play it if you want, but dont spend a penny in it, dont support the monopoly valve is running here, go buy a game that will actually have some positive impact on you.",1423.6
"team fortress 2 is a class-based mmofps war-themed hat simulator for the pc and mac. originally it was a faithful recreation of the original quake and half-life mods, but has since evolved from its original design into a pointless virtual collect-a-thon where the player must collect every rare item they can by any means necessary, in order to inflate their ego and show off their e-peen. the original point of the game revolved around playing game modes such as capturing the enemy intelligence, pushing a bomb to the enemy base, or controlling a whole map by scout-rushing control points, but now all this is nothing more than a small minigame to pass the time with while you wait for more weapons and rare items to magically drop into your inventory while doing  all on achievement, trade, idle or non-serious, fun-oriented servers.",36.8
"this game can be very fun. but all the people that play it are harsh, judgemental and very disrespectful. i started out loving this game and played the hell out of it but the put downs, insults and general negativity just bores on your sanity and makes you feel like your playing a game based on the youtube comments section of a pewdiepie video. i dont recommend this game because every single person. not one excuded are all disrespectful and looking to victimise you even when you mute them, these people will do everything to make you feel as unwelcome and outright hated as possible and theres only one thing you can do. not play the game. call of duty is more bearable than this.",864.2

"very fun and addicting game. like cod, but with more humor and weapons. it makes you spend hours and hours of gameplay inbetween. now, with mann vs. machine, it packs it up with the robotic boogaloo update, and tons of hats and weapons to obtain. it packs a punch, such as when you get hit with a market gardener crit, or just simply going on a lazypurple silly server, and mess stuff up. my personal favorite of the game is rocket jumping. i spend most of my time on the scout class, seeing that i packed tons and tons of time on this, getting stranges. this game is an immediate 10/10. you just need to know how to play and know what you are doing. my suggestion, do not play team fortress classic. it is the worst experience in tfc. it is nothing like this game. other than the previous, it is an amazing game. edit: also ruined my life. still the best game ever.",770.7

"at first appearance team fortress 2 seams to be a ridiculous game. but, it is far from it. valve have definitely thought of everything here, where they have even created an in depth story line. this game has opened up lots of new ways for people to get creative wether it be creating maps or even just selecting the best class. the game features several items which someone can obtain to get that edge on another player or just look silly with all the customizable apparel. i feel like their is still alot of room for other people to create new ways to see this game and i am personnaly excited to see more development.",162.9

"has mutated bread with a mouth in a jar full of milk! 10/10",147.5
"this game has a lot of great things about it that makes it worth playing. the fact that its there is no real leveling system and how good you are at the game depends on your skill only and not leveling up or picking perks is absolutely amazing. it forces you to learn and get better at the game. its great to play by yourself but so much better when you have a group of friends to play with. the best free to play game ive ever played.",778.5

"its tf2. wtf are you reading reviews for? just download it!",7.6
"i have recently only joined the steam community. a friend recommended my this game, and even though this game is free, it a pretty good game to be fair. it has in-game purchases, but it is optional, and the cost of premium is literally how ever much the cheapest item is. i paid 0.06 for premium, and i was quite surprised.",306.7
"basically its a first person shooter from valve, while that in itself guarantees quality , id like to adress the good and the possible bad sides of the game. good: excellent shooter, best hat collector simulator on the current market, good free to play model so its not really pay 2 win more just play a lot to win :d(skill helps), classes feel fleshed out and really well polished great synergies and other good things bad: if you want to entirely free to play it you will have to play alot, hmmm i cant actually think of anymore conclusion: its good m8 go play it, besides its f2p so its worth a try atleast right?",162.1
"i love this game i recommend everyone to play it i have fun all day playing",727.4

"great game for first person shooter ! highly reccomended ! 5 stars out of 5. :)",112.8
"this is proably the best game ive ever played. ive played other shooters like battlefield and cod but none have been as well crafted or balanced as tf2. its called team fortress for a reason you really have to work as a team or you will be destroyed by your enemies, each class has its own strenghts and weaknesses and you have to factor that in. the gameplay is smooth, fun and addictive. my social life has died after i bought this, the only way my friends contact me is via steam or throwing bricks with notes attached to them through my window. i love the classes the maps and most importantly the hats. i find it amazing and awesome updates are still coming out for this game , even though it was released in 2007. there is a constant stream of new maps, guns and most importantly hats. 7 years of hat themed fun. 10/10 go download it, its awesome.",554.5

"ive been playing this game for about two years now and i still think that it is amazing! i definitely recommend this to others, who havnt tried it yet, because im sure that you will have a good experience about it. because there is no doubt that i had that. i also like how valve included that you can earn items and even trade with them! i have spend so much time on trading, and i have loved it. thank you valve, for making such a fantastic game with so many options!",1171.2

"very fun and addicting game. like cod, but with more humor and weapons. it makes you spend hours and hours of gameplay inbetween. now, with mann vs. machine, it packs it up with the robotic boogaloo update, and tons of hats and weapons to obtain. it packs a punch, such as when you get hit with a market gardener crit, or just simply going on a lazypurple silly server, and mess stuff up. my personal favorite of the game is rocket jumping. i spend most of my time on the scout class, seeing that i packed tons and tons of time on this, getting stranges. this game is an immediate 10/10. you just need to know how to play and know what you are doing. my suggestion, do not play team fortress classic. it is the worst experience in tfc. it is nothing like this game. other than the previous, it is an amazing game. edit: also ruined my life. still the best game ever.",770.7

"this game is good, but you just have 9 different classes to be. but its funny and i still play the game!",377.9
"tf2 is the best ftp game you will ever find, with new hats, weapons & taunts to unlock & discover. there are many different game modes such as man vs machine, king of the hill, capture the flag, payload, contol points and many more which you can get stuck into. despite the amazingness of this game, i strongly do not recommend this to call of duty players as this game, (even though call of duty is a good game), actually involves skills.",665.8
"one of the best ftp i ever played. not pay to win. everyone must hail to the lord of hats gaben tho",131.8
"in the old ages, it was just buy n play. now look what happened! tf classic has made tf2 to make a great non pay-to-win game! spending money on this is just for looks, not for better op weapons! 5/5! best free to play game ever!",343.3

"ive wasted way too much money on this game to write a proper review for it. bottom line - great game, wasting money on it was totally worth it, and everyone who has a steam account should at least try it once. 9.5/10 (.5 was deducted because of the vast sums of birthday money lost forever)",697.3

"this game is seriously fun. it has totally consumed my life.",325.6
"it claims to be the most fun to be found on the internet, and frankly, id have trouble contesting that. its a brilliant game, a very fun fps with a nice art style that avoids the gritty immersion of games like cod and battlefield in favour of a more light-hearted approach to combat. the classes balance out nicely, the game has developed its own economy...and you have more than 300 hats to collect. did i mention the hats? tf2 may be the only shooting game based on hats. you could say that...theyre to die for! ... ill see myself out.",333.7

"balance? check. teamwork? check. nonsense that has nothing to do with the game? hell yeah. trust me. after 1000+ hours of playing this game i probably will never stop. atleast until ing keys stop acting like gas prices in the us. but seriously i love this game. one of my favorites. only way it could get better is if you could customize your experience. oh wait....",1895.6

"fun game! good for building up reputation in the steam community!",179.7
"okay, all the hat, dance, and bread jokes aside, team fortress 2 is really a great game at the core. theres no other class-based shooter out there that has the balanced gameplay*, character depth, and fun of tf2. even if you get bored with playing as a stock scout or demo, theres loads of alternative weapons that match your playstyle, whether that be stuffing your enemies backs with lead/fire (back scatter/backburner,) charging into the fray with your little sentry buddy (gunslinger,) taking the biggest bloody sword you can find and chopping a dumb s head off (eyelander,) or getting crit rewards for every backstab and sap you make (diamondback.) tf2s rock-paper-scissors style of gameplay forces everyone to get along, and thats what i love in the end: a game that makes everyone strategize. oh, and speaking of rock-paper-scissors, you can do that too. to the death! *not all gameplay is balanced. im looking at you, phlogistinator.",1679.3

"tf2 is a great first person shooter with many items and hats. i reccomend this game, but stuff in the store is very expencive and crates arent worth opening. keep an open eye in trading, too!",255.1
"this game is indeed very fun (quite addicting too) if you like fps games then this is the game for you. by the way, did you know its free! omg",401.9
"if you love mindless fps multiplayer where you shoot everything not the same colour as you (and maybe capture a point or two) then go ahead play this game. there is no reason not to as it is mostly free and it is very well made. for me i have become bored of this gamestyle.",60.3

"i love this game! it is the best and most addicting game ive ever played! download this game right now",695.0
"i would like to say this, this game is not p2w, it is better if you are premium, but you can find just about everything (except for hats) whilst still being f2p. i bought premium status for 10 cents! what? 10 cents? das alot. being premium definately makes the game more fun (i.e able to trade more stuff, get hats, more weapons) but it is absolutely not needed. if not for all the squeakers; this game would get an 11/10, but for now, itll have to settle for a 10/10. sorry tf2.",350.8

"awesome game. i recommend this awesome game to everyone!",329.8
"this game is really good i like the cartoony fell to it. with diffrent weapons and many players this is a fun game. but there are some negatives, the game is constantly pushing you to go to the store were you have to spend real money. and the game severs arent the best, like some times i get into a game were both teams are on mega defence and no one can do anything (or the other way aroung) but the over all game play of it, and the fact that you can really play for free is good for me. its a good game. see you in the game. ------------------------",104.1
"nice game for fun and adventure thumbs up for being free..................",8.5
"what can i say about this game? alot really, but ill keep it short and sweet. the weaponry are bizarre and are pretty awesome. some, not all. alot of them can be very confusing to use to start with. the items, such as hats, pets, floating random things, are an awesome thing to buy, trade, and find. the gameplay is awesome as well. hate the fact that, when a team is on to something, it takes one person to screw it up. but its still a fun worthy game to play if you havent. the characters are unique, the techniques are insane, the areas are confusing at first but fun. tf2!!!!",92.9
"i have played multiple hours and had extraordinary fun on this game. it combines modern-day weaponry with humerous animated graphics and hats. tf2 also makes you work as a team member, for each team relies on every class to do their job right. i gaurentee you will be satisfied you got this game. i giv it 5 stars!",1065.6
"cool game always gets up dates but if this is not a game for you stop playing it",1807.4
"this is not a game. this is the representation of meth, presented as a game. it will feed on your soul and leave you with the desire for another hat to buy. it will ruin your life. but youll have the best time of your life playing it. 9001/10",1317.3
"its awesome and very good war game , good graphics. best ever!",860.4
"team fortress is epic.... the randomized crap thats in the game is hilarious and i would definetly recommend playing this game!",166.6
"tf2 is definitely a good game, with potentially 100s or 1000s of hours of gameplay. even after the novelty of the cartoonish graphics wears off, whats left behind is a robust online fps with a difference. the game is also more welcoming to newer gamers, who dont have high end hardware, as the game is not so hardware intensive.",281.4
"i was slightly disappointed with this game. the amount of money you need to waste to get anything good is appalling. gameplay and game modes are good however i think some of the classes are a bit under powered and compared to other classes they just get destroyed. this game is good for any of you out there who want a good free to play game. i recommend the scout and pyro classes for those of you who lie to rush to the objective and the heavy and sniper classes for a defensive, much slower gamer.",15.9
"this is a really fun first person shooting game i would reccomend playing this game",480.9
"does this even need a review these days? 10/10, like skyrim with hats",1868.5
"really good, such enjoyable, much balance, so doge",480.8
"fun, action-packed, never boring game with a co-op mode and extra humour! i love it. i would defiantely recommend this game. i love the idea of co-op and multiplayer but someday i wish they would add a single-player gamemode fit with a story. but of course we cant end this report with a request, we must end it with a... with a... hat",231.2

"americas #1 war themed hat simulator. its got hats, what else do you want? a class-based online shooter? but seriously, beyond that coating of cosmetic items and general crazyness theres still a sweet multiplayer experience, accessible to all kinds of players. be sure to bring friends, or at least try finding a server where people talk, it quickly becomes frustrating if youre playing by yourself, after all, its called team fortress for a reason!",1828.6

"this game is really good if you like guns, hats and hats. you can even become a bird after the latest updates! its amazing stuff, it even has hats! oh yeah, did i mention it has hats? look at all those hats! there are weapons too, but its the hats that are awesome. you can even trade for hats, like a hat that costs one refined and others that cost a billion refined. oh, you dont know what a refined is? oh, youll learn, dont worry. i give this game an: a out of wisconsin",1247.2
"this is what u want to get free, and if u know this game is the best of all of em that i have recommended why? try it out and ur see why sorry this will be a long review lets begin --------whats so good about it--------- this game team fortress 2 has a drop system the drop system gives u items every time u get a drop its maybe diffrent time every time u play it well, when u get weapons to ur classes theres 9 classes demo(demoman)scout, spy, heavy, engineer, sniper, medic, soilder, pyro, and thats all but theres a system/ a way to play every class and thats... amazing! so when ur having ur inevtory full two things to do now buy a premium/a item or trade/craft with the items so u can get ur first hat/misc then ur amazingly cool and it can change how people will respect u",648.7

"its incredible to see a game that has lasted for so long, yet still feels fresh and new. between the massive economy of the items in the game to the regular features and events valve has in the game, this game is one of the best you could get on steam, for one of the best prices you can get on steam.",588.7
"its like a rock, paper, scissors version of a first person shooter. each class is designed to have an edge over one and to be stomped by another. the sense of humor is what keeps me coming back. i will shamelessly destroy cartoons all day instead of that call of duty: modern borefare any day. all hail gaben!",176.2
"i dont have to spell out why this is a must-play game, do i? i mean, theres nearly a dozen game modes. theres 9 distinct character classes with their own fully defined personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. theres the new mann vs. machine co-op addition. theres new content being added on a regular basis. theres hundreds of unique weapons, hats, and support items to be found, traded for, or bought. theres the simple controls, complex battle strategies, and easy to jump into match system. and theres the quirky, rockwell-esque art style that belies the myriad gruesome ways to dispatch your opponents. but all you need to know is that team fortress 2 is completely free to play. thats right, the biggest, funnest, most insane multiplayer game on the web costs zilch to download. so if youre a steam user and you dont play tf2... you are like tiny baby who cannot kill anything!",417.7

"team fortress 2. i remember how it was a retail game back in the day. now that its free to play, theres really no reason to not give it a try. tf2 was balanced in such a way that it really supports the teamwork aspect without taking away an individuals influence. hats, cosmetic items, keys, and so on are always fun to collect. most really are just cosmetic and change how things sound or look. the quest to find more items is really a decent long-term goal that pushes you to keep playing.",192.4
"the nine classes all play very differently, and each class has at least 20 different weapons, so there is a lot of variety in the gameplay. no matter what type of gamer you are, as long as you are comfortable with first-person view you should be able to find your own niche and do well in tf2.",665.6

"this game is very fun to play, but will get boring after about a thousand hours. whatever you may have heard, this is not a pay-to-win game and everyone has an equal chance. in fact, the stalk weapons are usually your best choice and buying weapons is not the way to go. do not fall for the buying keys and openning crates thing. you will regret it. also, unusual hats and strange/festive items are pretty useless with just a few cosmetic perks, so dont feel down if you dont have any. this is a multiplayer must-have though.",133.5

"i have owned this game since the beginning and i still play it today. . . love it",2268.8
"ive never enjoyed mmos because they all look the same and the communities arent pleasant to deal with. with tf2, i find myself enjoying a significant decrease in jerks, and a community that enjoys supporting a game they love; even contributing material. as for the look, i adore the highly-stylized, almost cartoony appearance, and the way it doesnt take itself seriously. so many little in-jokes and hysterical lines. i appreciate such loving details; its perfect for what i want my games to be, not to mention the thing is fun to play. amazingly balanced, unique class playstyle on familiar class names, and i dont dislike playing a single one. theres a reason this is my favorite game, and has been consistently since my hire date. in short, go play this thing, because it really is the most fun you can have online.",1178.2
"excellent game. still a large amount of official servers, private servers and of course, players. frequently updated as well. the 9 classes and quite fast paced, chaotic nature of the game result in a completely different experience each time you play, keeping the game interesting for a long time.",580.9

"for one, this game is amazing. personally its the best game ive stumbled apon, i give it a 10 out of 10. it dosent matter if you play defense, offense, or anything else really. this game is fun, you could be a heavy and be healed rushing into battle to capture a point, or being the sniper covering the medic and heavy from enemies behind, or far ahead. the fun in this game is endless. have fun!",292.9
"its a little better than heroin and its free: team fortress 2 is as pleasurable as a very hot, but cheap, .",61.3
"this game is probably one of my favorite first person shooters ever. there is so much variety in the different weapons and hats and miscellaneious items. if you get bored of fighting your friends in attack and defend or payload, switch over to mvm and work together to smash robots heads in! team fortress 2 will probably overwhelm players in the beginning who are used to say, call of duty or battlefield. this game is nothing like those games. i suppose the closest you can get is the sniper, with his smg, and sniper rifle. but i digress, youll have to play a tf2 to get what i mean. anyway, this if one of, if not the best free to play game ever made. i sure plenty of people will agree with me when i say that. also, dont get your hopes up on hats, they are so expensive now. along with keys. but hey, so long as you have your gibus, merc badge, and pyrovison googles, you should be fine. now get out and kill some guys, welcome to team fortress 2!",531.9

"amazing game, truely valves best work in the multiplayer fps genre.",937.1
"team fortress 2 (more commonly reffered to as tf2) is a must-have for pc gamers, it isnt the best game on steam, but its certainly one of the essentials to most players libraries. whats so fantastic about tf2 is that it actually is one of the few shooters that does require teamwork. each of the 9 characters has something vital to winning a match, and so it relies less on skill (although this is still important) and more on things like: medic focusing on certain players and the sniper doing his best to hold the fort. another pro is that it can be played casually or competitively, you can hop into a match and have a little fun, or you can gather a team and use commands to become a somewhat unbeatable squad. furthermore, the world in which your warriors wage war on one another is so deliciously colourful and cartoonish that the game never feels like its taking itself too seriously. still a marvel to behold...all for the awesome price of free!",34.2

"do you have nothing to do and like to waste time? then tf2 is for you! tf2 is a fps and is team based. there are multiple gamemodes such as ctf, koth, and tdm. this is a good game and has millions of weapons for you to choose from. every hour you play, you get different weapons. you can get crap weapons, or amazing weapons. its random so you can only hope. you can also buy items, but (in my opinion) its only good for getting the weapon or item you want, and getting more slots. i thinki dont care if theres a third, but it would be cool. also it can be a hat simulator 2013 cause you really do need hats. dey be precious hopefully i have convinced you to get this game (and to some extend buy something!). please give this game a chance, its really good. thank you for looking at this review!",519.0
"a very fun team based fps... but in all its glory it is very difficult to learn. new players often get thrown into a game they do not understand and have to face players that have far more expereince. another factor is that tf2 doesnt really relate to any other shooter there is, its certainly not like cod or battlefield. tf2 has a certain balance which has to be understood first but doing so takes time and that puts a lot of people off. if you wanna play this game and be good at it, dont just download and play it, inform yourself a bit first. use youtube and get yourself more familiar with this game.",1204.9

"tf2 has had a strong community for many years, and for good reason. beneath all the weapon unlocks and silly cosmetics, the game has one of the most balanced set of mechanics of any first person shooter that i have had the chance to play. all the classes are situational, allowing intelligent players to deal with a wide variety of situations. the health, mobility, and damage of each class is fine tuned to make sure there is no clear cut best class, and in less organized games one can do well with any class given enough experience. each class presents such different game play that the replay value is very high, and there are many populated servers to play on. it also has a very active competitve scene, for when you feel your skills have evolved to the next level. overall, tf2 is still around because it is a great game and i would certainly recommend it to anyone who is interested in a fast paced first person shooter with some comic relief.",1799.9

"a team based fps thats free to play, its fun,excited,and has hats. also it has tons of game modes capture the flag,king of the hill,capture points,payload,and more! never one point playing tf2 have i gotten bored of it,theres is endless possiblities. it even has humor,and the characters are very detailed(back story,personality,play style) each character has its flaws and downsides. for example the heavy is slow,but has high hp and damage. or scout who is the fastest,but has the lowest hp(125) anyway,i can go on and on about this masterpiece,its deserves a 100/10 flawless and endless fun!!!!",1895.6

"used to be a very good class based shooter. now its just a cosmetic item showcase (especially hats). in my opinion they added too much variation on gear. imagine if dota started as it is now, but then added interchangable skills for each character. would make it way more complex, yes, but would make balance even harder to achieve. now imagine if not everyone had access to those skills on release of this hypothetical update, but instead had to either trade for them, earn them through random drops, or straight-up buy them from valve. thats what happened to tf2.",137.8

"team fortress 2 (more commonly reffered to as tf2) is a must-have for pc gamers, it isnt the best game on steam, but its certainly one of the essentials to most players libraries. whats so fantastic about tf2 is that it actually is one of the few shooters that does require teamwork. each of the 9 characters has something vital to winning a match, and so it relies less on skill (although this is still important) and more on things like: medic focusing on certain players and the sniper doing his best to hold the fort. another pro is that it can be played casually or competitively, you can hop into a match and have a little fun, or you can gather a team and use commands to become a somewhat unbeatable squad. furthermore, the world in which your warriors wage war on one another is so deliciously colourful and cartoonish that the game never feels like its taking itself too seriously. still a marvel to behold...all for the awesome price of free!",34.2

"a brilliant, strategic game. you can play, or just trade items. edit as of 1/25/2015: that wasnt very specific, was it? anyways, tf2 differs from other fpses in that its not just about pointing and shooting. except for the pyro. you have to work with your team. the spy picks out the important enemies, as well as the sniper. engineer helps to regen health and metal with their dispenser, and defends with their sentry gun. medics are important-and an example of how tf2 is not just about the killing. its also about protecting your team and sticking with them all the way. except for the pyro. of course.",525.0

"definitely one of the top fpss ive ever played. well balanced, multiple gamemodes, a good selection of maps and modded servers, multiple classes: each with good balance and interesting abilities, hundreds of items and weapons, neat, cartoon-like graphics style. the only downfalls i see are: the community can be annoying at times (although what game doesnt contain that anymore?), trading has a somewhat large learning curve (imo), and the price of some of the items in the store seem a bit pricy. overall id rate this game 91/100.",319.7

"i love this game, there is really something in it for everyone: from turning your enemies into a fine red mist with the sniper, to backstabbing people dancing the conga and even joking about drinking jarate there seems to be an endless supply of random stuff flying out of the mouths and weapons of the games unique characters. there is really no fps like it. sure console games like cod and halo have better graphics, but can you stick a rake into the head of an invisible person on cod, can you hit a person in the face with a giant neon sign on halo, i think not. as well as the brilliance of the actuall game there is, of course, a fantastic community hub that goes with it that makes this game a masterpiece. a rating of 10/10 is too little for this game and 11/10 is just copying someone elses idea so i am going to give it 134x123672637257`9829128686986986968ffssd986698968as69s8d67sa9s868/10. didnt just headbutt keyboard with excitement.",246.7

"i dont get it why people rate this game so high. yes, i agree. the 2007 version where each class actually had a chance to shoot others was good now, the weapon balance is so bad, id rather just play call of duty, which is another pile of dirtbag there are 9. damn. classes. 9! 4 of them are op af and the others are just not worth a second playing with. take the soldier for example. he has a damn rocket launcher! that rocket launcher should have a higher radius of blast, shouldnt it? but if i miss the enemy by even one cm, nothing happens. nothing get your damn pyro, soldier, demoman and engineer and shove them up your  because they do nothing. its not a fair chance for those who wish to try classes other than the sandvich-eater, the health nazi, the baseball scout or the kgb spy -_- i can only give this game a negative rating for the damn stupid weapon balance it brings and i will never ever touch this piece of crap again",1.0

"this used to be such a great game. then it turned into a hat simulator with people spending more time on (getting/building) hats than on actual teamplay. and believe me, this used to be one hell of a first person tactical multiplayer shooter. back when it was still in beta form and shortly after that this used to be the only game i played. the cartoony graphics still look brilliant, and the gameplay is magnificent as well. i only wish they would remove the hats (wishful thinking, i know). the gameplay relies to heavily on teambased gameplay, which is a good thing, believe me, but not when a lot of people are scattered all over the place. you really have to work as a team at times. still, for a (now) free game its pretty much the best thing you can get out there. in the end i would still highly recommend it.

"let me just say that the mechanics here in team fortress 2 is amazing. you do eventually start to feel tempted to pay money for items, but considering the fact that all items in tf2 are balanced, its not pay 2 win. camping is hard to do due to the fact that no class really has a machine gun or a weapon capable of killing an enemy in a single hit. spies can pick off campers. my only minor complaint, which is more of a compliment, is the fact that no class matches those in games like cod or bf, making it harder for players of either series to get adapted soon. and of course, vice versa. bye.",880.2

"at the time of this review, i have played about 530 hours of this game. i have enjoyed every second, whether i would prefer to admit it or not. the feeling you get by firing any weapon and getting a kill is enough to go back again and again. unlike counter-strike, the weapons are very cartoonish and the game is just a joke that makes you want to laugh in a mans face when they are pinned against a wall due to an arrow. the animations are, to say the least, hilarious the first time i saw them. i recommend this game for if you have a few hours to kill, or a few people. i also like to land on some peoples head after a rocket jump and make a poop noise. but thats just me. if you like realistic shooters, this game is not for you. if you are used to clicking on people, this game is not for you. if you are an fps player who yearns for something different, this game is defienitly for you. cheers. oh, and there are also a few bugs and hackers too. 9.9/10",668.4
